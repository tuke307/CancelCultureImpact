Manson não tirou costela para fazer sexo oral em si,"Em sua autobiografia, ""The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell"", Marilyn Manson falou sobre o boato de jeito irônico. ""Se eu realmente tivesse removido minhas costelas, eu estaria ocupado chupando meu próprio pênis em 'The Wonder Years' em vez de buscar Winnie Cooper"", disse, em menção a outro rumor - de que ele seria o intérprete do personagem Paul Pfeiffer, de Josh Saviano.
Além disso, quem tem tempo para matar filhotes de cachorro quando se pode chupar o próprio pênis? Acho que vou ligar para um cirurgião.

E Andressa Urach? A ex- A Fazenda (Record) realizou o procedimento para reduzir as medidas da cintura.Ela também colocou um litro de silicone em cada mama e fez lipoaspiração na cintura. Ao mostrar as costelas retiradas, ela escreveu nas redes sociais: ""Que lindas minhas costelinhas.""
Urach confidenciou que fez as mudanças pensando no seu conteúdo adulto. ""Sou muito vaidosa e sempre tive o sonho de ter a cintura ainda mais fina. Tenho 72 cm e com essa cirurgia existe a possibilidade de diminuir de seis até 18 centímetros. Acho que vou ficar com o corpo ainda mais sexy para meus vídeos de conteúdo adulto. Imagina que lindo, peito bem grande e cintura bem fina. Quero vender mais conteúdos.""",2024-03-20T15:00:00Z,https://www.uol.com.br,UOL
Marilyn Manson Hitting the Road with Five Finger Death Punch,"[Trigger warning: this article contains descriptions of domestic violence, as well as sexual and physical abuse.]
Marilyn Manson announced his first live dates in nearly five years on Friday (March 8), marking the shock rocker’s return to the road after more than half a dozen women accused the him of sexual and emotional abuse. The news came in an X post in which Manson revealed that he and Slaughter to Prevail will be hitting the road this summer/fall for a 30-date arena/amphitheater tour with Five Finger Death Punch slated to kick off on August 2 at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, PA.
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
More than a dozen women have accused Manson (born Brian Warner), 55, of sexual, emotional and physical assault, including actress Evan Rachel Wood, who was the subject of the two-part HBO 2022 documentary Phoenix Rising that delved into her claims of the abuse she claims she allegedly suffered at the rocker’s hand during an on-and-off relationship that began when she was 18.
Manson, who has denied all the allegations, reached a settlement with actress Esme Bianco last year to end her sexual assault lawsuit after a judge dismissed another sexual abuse suit from model Ashley Morgan Smithline. Previously, an L.A. Superior Court judge dismissed a suit against Manson filed by a former personal assistant alleging sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Trending on Billboard
The singer was sued over allegations of sexual assault against a minor in January 2023, in which the “Jane Doe” claimed Manson groomed and sexually assaulted the then-underage girl early in his career. The graphic details of that Doe suit closely match the allegations from a number of the other women who have made claims against Manson, including that the singer subjected them to “hostile and verbally abusive behavior,” as well as racially charged language mixed with the sharing of intimate personal details.
After initially declining to name Manson as her abuser, Wood posted an Instagram statement in Feb. 2021 in which she wrote that “he [Manson] started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander or blackmail.” Among her horrifying claims were that Manson would “draw swastikas over my bedside table when he was mad at me” and that he would allegedly tie the actress up and torture her ritualistically, lashing her to a “kneeler” bench and hitting her “over and over” with a Nazi whip from the Holocaust before shocking her welts and private areas until she broke the bench in half. Following Wood’s claims four other women came forward with similar allegations against Manson in a Vanity Fair article.
Manson has countersued a number of his alleged victims — in addition to settle Bianco’s suit — and judges have dismissed several of the abuse lawsuits against him over the past three years. In the wake of the raft of allegations, Manson was dropped by his record label Loma Vista Records in Feb. 2021 as well as by his longtime manager, Tony Ciulla, several days later.
The “Antichrist Superstar” singer has been off the road since the final August 18, 2019 date on the Twins of Evil: Hell Never Dies joint tour with Rob Zombie and hasn’t released new music since his 2020 We Are Chaos album.

Marilyn Manson termina serviço comunitário,"Marilyn Manson / Reprodução / Instagram /@marilynmanson
Marilyn Manson finalizou seu serviço comunitário, após ser condenado por crime de contravenção simples, ao ter assoado o nariz em uma operadora de câmera em um show em New Hampshire em 2019, e foi processado por isso.
Marilyn Manson é condenado a reembolsar a ex
Na época Manson não contestou a acusação, o que significa que ele aceitou a condenação, mas não se declarou culpado pelo suposto crime em si.
O crime pode acarretar pena de prisão de até um ano e multa de US$ 2.000, mas a parte lesada pediu US$ 35.000 (R$ 137 mil) em danos relacionados ao seu equipamento fotográfico.
Apesar do suposto incidente ter ocorrido em 2019 durante sua turnê “Hell Never Dies”, demorou mais dois anos para que ele se entregasse às autoridades.

Na época, o advogado de Manson, Howard King, argumentou que o astro do rock gostava de ser “provocativo” no palco e classificou a reivindicação monetária como “ridícula” porque não havia evidências de quaisquer danos.
Testemunhas do show lembraram que a mulher parecia “semi-irritada” quando Manson – cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Warner – começou a cuspir para todos os lados.
Marilyn Manson passa a ser procurado pela polícia
Uma delas disse à revista “People”:
“Ele estava cuspindo em todos os lugares e uma vez isso apareceu na câmera dela, então ela enxugou e parecia semi-irritada.”
“Acho que a gota d’água foi que ele caiu no chão, ficou a meio metro dela e limpou o nariz e disparou contra ela, não para a câmera. Ela ficou enojada, então saiu furiosa e ele apenas riu.”
Outro afirmou: “Ele cuspiu nela algumas vezes e depois se inclinou bem perto da câmera e lançou um enorme ranho nela!”",2024-02-07T16:45:00Z,https://www.ofuxico.com.br,OFuxico

Marilyn Manson completes community service for NH assault charge,"Marilyn Manson, who was sentenced to community service for blowing his nose on a videographer at a 2019 concert in New Hampshire, recently completed his time at an organization that provides meeting space for Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon, according to court paperwork.

A no contest plea means Manson did not contest the charge and did not admit guilt.
He initially was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from the encounter with the videographer at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford on Aug. 19, 2019. The second charge, alleging that he spit on the videographer, was dropped.
Manson also was fined. He needs to remain arrest-free and notify local police of any New Hampshire performances for two years.
Prosecutor Andrew Livernois had said it was his first offense and he had no prior record.
Manson initially pleaded not guilty to both charges in 2021. His lawyer had said that the type of filming the videographer was doing commonly exposes videographers to “incidental contact” with bodily fluids.

Marilyn Manson é condenado a reembolsar a ex,"Marilyn Manson / Reprodução / Instagram/@marilynmanson
A juíza do Tribunal Superior do Condado de Los Angeles, Teresa A. Beaudet, ordenou a Marilyn Manson o reembolso de quase US$ 327 mil (R$ 1,6 milhão) à ex-noiva Evan Rachel Wood, para cobrir os honorários advocatícios, após o tribunal rejeitar suas acusações de difamação.
Manson perdeu contrato com gravadora na época
O roqueiro, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Warner, processou a atriz em março de 2022, alegando que Wood o difamou e atrapalhou sua carreira quando ela o acusou publicamente em 2021, de abuso durante seu relacionamento.
Segundo a revista “Rolling Stone”, as alegações de Manson, de ‘difamação e sofrimento emocional’ foram rejeitadas pela mesma juíza no ano passado.
Conspiração?
Wood e sua amiga Illma Gore serão julgadas em 1º de maio por outros motivos. Elas estão sendo acusadas de conspirar para invadir o computador de Manson, se passar por ele online e fazer uma ligação que enviou policiais até sua casa.
Depois que Wood tornou públicas suas alegações em 2021, várias outras mulheres apresentaram acusações semelhantes contra o músico.
No processo, ele acusou a atriz e Gore de ‘recrutar acusadoras para participarem de um ataque coordenado’, mas esta alegação não será apresentada ao júri.

A maioria dos processos de abuso contra Manson foram resolvidos, indeferidos ou arquivados. Ele negou todas as acusações e jurou que era vítima dessas pessoas.
Acusações
Na época das denúncias contra o cantor, ele se defendeu: “Obviamente minha arte e minha vida tem sido têm sido ímãs para controvérsia, mas essas afirmações recentes sobre mim são horríveis distorções da realidade”, disse.
“Meus relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram inteiramente consensuais com parceiros que pensam como eu. Independentemente de como – e por que – os outros agora estão optando por deturpar o passado, essa é a verdade”, escreveu.
Manson chama pandemia de ‘mentalmente devastadora’
E Marilyn Manson ainda perdeu o contrato com a gravadora Loma Vista Recordings após a denúncia feita por Evan. Seu relato, aliás, fez com que outras mulheres que se relacionaram com o cantor também o acusassem por comportamento abusivo.
“À luz das alegações perturbadoras de Evan Rachel Wood e outras mulheres nomeando Marilyn Manson como seu agressor, Loma Vista deixará de promover seu álbum atual, com efeito imediato”, afirmaram naquela ocasião.

Este não é o primeiro processo de abuso contra o artista. Sua ex-assistente Ashley Walters também abriu um processo contra Manson, acusando-o de agredi-la sexualmente e abuso físico.
Acusações de assédio sexual e estupro

""Ele começou a me assediar quando eu ainda era uma adolescente e abusou terrivelmente de mim por anos. Eu sofri uma lavagem cerebral e fui manipulada à submissão"", escreveu ela no Instagram.
Outras mulheres o acusaram de assédio sexual, tortura e estupro desde então — como Esme Bianco, que foi a primeira a protocolar ação judicial contra Manson.

THE BIG STORY: Luke Combs Accidentally Sues A Fan
How on earth do you sue someone unintentionally? That’s what the entire music industry was asking last week after Luke Combs said he had been “utterly unaware” that he’d sued a Florida woman and won a $250,000 judgment against her — all over the sale of a few Combs-themed drinking mugs on the internet.
The answer: By adopting the same kind of mass-litigation tactics used by big retail brands to fight fake merchandise on the internet. Suing hundreds of people at once and notifying them by email gives companies — and, increasingly, music artists — a powerful tool to help stem a flood of confusing knockoffs, but some legal experts warn that such litigation can be “abusive.”
For more, go read our full story — on Combs’ apology to the fan, his underlying lawsuit, and the strange world of anti-counterfeiting litigation that it highlighted.

YOUNGBOY HOUSE ARREST – A federal judge refused to alter the conditions of NBA YoungBoy‘s house arrest to let him spend more time in the recording studio creating music while he awaits trial on federal gun charges. The judge was unswayed by arguments from the rapper’s attorneys that his record sales have dropped because he has been unable to travel to the studio to “produce the quality of music that his fans expect.”
MJ ESTATE STRIKES AGAIN – Lawyers for the Michael Jackson estate quietly threatened to sue a pop culture collectibles website last week over plans to auction off unreleased Jackson studio recordings that the estate claimed were “unquestionably stolen,” resulting in the site withdrawing the materials from the sale.
MARILYN MANSON RULING – A California appeals court ruled that Marilyn Manson’s former assistant Ashley Walters could sue him for sexual assault, overturning an earlier decision that said she waited too long to bring her case. The appeals court said she potentially had “trauma-induced memory suppression” that rightfully delayed the filing of her case.
TICKETMASTER CASE SWIFTLY DROPPED – A Taylor Swift fan named Michelle Sterioff agreed to drop her class action against Ticketmaster parent Live Nation — one of two such cases filed in the wake of last year’s disastrous presale of tickets to the Eras Tour.
LIZZO HITS BACK – Lizzo’s attorneys fired back at a harassment and discrimination lawsuit filed by Asha Daniels, a former clothing designer for her tour — arguing that the accuser was nothing more than a “disgruntled” employee who had been fired after she “played hooky” on the day of a concert.",2023-12-19T21:01:50Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Marilyn Manson Abuse Allegations Timeline,"In February 2021, Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood named Marilyn Manson as her alleged abuser.
“I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent,” she shared via Instagram on Feb 1. Wood and Manson had a relationship when the actress was 18 and Manson was 36, and the pair were briefly engaged in 2010.
Manson denied the allegations in his own Instagram statement. “Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,” he wrote. “My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misinterpret the past, that is the truth.”
Billboard made earlier attempts to reach Manson for comment through his now former management, but has not received any responses.
Following Wood’s statement, a number of other women went public with their own claims against Manson, but his history with abuse allegations stems back nearly 25 years. See below for a full timeline.",2023-12-14T20:31:59Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Marilyn Manson Ex-Assistant’s Sexual Assault Lawsuit Revived by Appeals Court,"A lawsuit accusing Marilyn Manson of sexual assault, discrimination, battery, and harassment has been revived in an appeals court, Billboard reports. The lawsuit filed by former personal assistant Ashley Walters in 2021 was dismissed last year when a judge ruled that it exceeded California’s two-year statute of limitations. The appeals court reversal noted that the lawsuit is protected by the delayed discovery rule as Walters argued that trauma led her to suppress the memories until 2020.
“Until she received diagnosis and treatment, Walters [says she] was unable to remember the repressed events, and once she did recall them, she was unable to immediately identify these events as abuse,” the court opinion reads. “These allegations of suppressed memories and psychological blocking are sufficient to withstand [dismissal].”
“We believe this ruling makes certain that courts must factor in trauma induced repression into the legal reasoning why survivors often come forward years after their trauma to raise claims,” Walters’ attorney James Vagnini said in a statement. “This clears a path, much like many of the newly passed laws sweeping the country, allowing victims of sexual assault and harassment to raise their claims against their abusers when they are able to, not by a deadline set by statute.” Manson’s attorney offered no comment when reached by Pitchfork.
Manson has settled two lawsuits over alleged rape this year: one filed by Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco and another filed by a woman only referred to as Jane Doe. Ashley Morgan Smithline’s 2021 lawsuit against Manson was dismissed, and she later recanted her allegations. This year, he was sued by another Jane Doe who alleged grooming and abuse that began when she was a minor in the 1990s; Manson has denied her allegations. His defamation lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood is ongoing.

Marilyn Manson Ex-Assistant’s Sexual Assault Lawsuit Revived By Court,"A California appeals court ruled Wednesday (Dec. 13) that Marilyn Manson’s former assistant can sue him for sexual assault, overturning an earlier decision that said she waited too long to bring her case.
In a 24-page opinion, California’s Second Appellate District revived a lawsuit filed by Ashley Walters that claims Manson subjected her to brutal treatment, including sexual harassment and discrimination, during the year that she worked for him from 2010 to 2011.
A lower court had ruled last year that Walters’ lawsuit, filed in 2021, was barred by the statute of limitations, which requires such cases to be filed within two years. But on Wednesday, the appeals court said Walters’ case was fair game under the so-called delayed discovery rule, as she claims the trauma of the incidents caused her to suppress the memories until 2020.
“Until she received diagnosis and treatment, Walters [says she] was unable to remember the repressed events, and once she did recall them, she was unable to immediately identify these events as abuse,” the court wrote. “These allegations of suppressed memories and psychological blocking are sufficient to withstand [dismissal].”
A representative for Manson declined to comment on the ruling. An attorney for Walters did not immediately return a request for comment.
Walters was one of several women who accused Manson of sexual abuse in 2021. His former fiancé Evan Rachel Wood accused him of grooming and sexual abuse on Twitter in February 2021, and then others, including Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco and model Ashley Morgan Smithine, filed lawsuits against him.
Manson has denied all of the accusations, and several of the cases have been dismissed or settled. Manson later sued Wood for defamation, claiming she had “secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured” other women to make such allegations, though that case was largely dismissed earlier this year.
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
In her lawsuit, Walters claimed that Manson subjected her to “sexual exploitation, manipulation and psychological abuse” while she worked for him as a personal assistant. The alleged abuse included whipping her and throwing her against a wall in a “a drug-induced rage”; forcing her to stay awake for 48 hours by feeding her cocaine; and having “offered” her sexually to friends and associates.
In June 2022, the case was dismissed for being filed past the statute of limitations. Walters argued then that she had suppressed the memories of Manson’s abuse until other women began coming forward, but the judge said during a hearing that he had not seen “sufficient facts” to invoke the delayed-discovery rule.
In Wednesday’s ruling overturning that decision, the appeals court did not say that Walters’ accusations against Manson were true. Instead, it merely said that her allegations were enough for the case to survive being dismissed at the outset. The court recounted various claims that, if proven true, would mean that Walters had truly not discovered the abuse until 2020.
“The complaint described the support group Walters joined in October 2020 and recounted the stories shared by the other abused women that ‘began to unlock new memories [Walters] repressed long ago as a result of her psychological trauma by being manipulated and threatened by Warner during and after her employment,’” the court wrote. “The complaint also described how Walters began therapy in November 2020 and was diagnosed the following month with complex posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.”
The ruling sends the case back to the trial court, where the parties will engage in more litigation, conduct discovery and move toward an eventual trial.

Fargo Season 5 Soundtrack Guide - Every Song & When It Plays,"Summary The Fargo season 5 soundtrack has a ton of great needle-drops in between pieces from its foreboding original score.
The use of licensed music in FX's Fargo ties back to the classic Coen brothers movie it was based on, which featured songs by Merle Haggard and Boy George.
Fargo season 5 includes songs by such renowned artists as Yes, Rush, and Marilyn Manson.
The Fargo season 5 soundtrack is full of great needle-drops. The original Coen brothers movie is remembered for its creepy, foreboding score by regular Coen collaborator Carter Burwell, but it had its fair share of licensed music, too. “Big City” by Merle Haggard can be heard in the King of Clubs when Jerry meets with Carl and Gaear. Boy George’s cover version of “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” is playing in the garage while Shep works. Carl and his escort watch a live nightclub performance of “Let’s Find Each Other Tonight” by José Feliciano.
Noah Hawley, the creator of the TV adaptation of Fargo, has kept that spirit alive with a bunch of awesome needle-drops. The latest season of Fargo, which stars Juno Temple as a Midwestern housewife with a dark past and Jon Hamm as the crooked lawman on her tail, has a terrific soundtrack. In Fargo season 5, Hawley has featured rock ‘n’ roll hits by Yes and Rush, classic tunes performed by Ralph Stanley and Charlotte Gainsbourg, and even a catchy number from The Nightmare Before Christmas.
Fargo Season 5, Episode 1, ""The Tragedy Of The Commons""
“I’ve Seen All Good People” by Yes
by Yes “Gloryland” by Ralph Stanley
by Ralph Stanley “Hey Joe” by Charlotte Gainsbourg
“I’ve Seen All Good People” by Yes – This prog rock hit plays over the opening titles and into the opening scene of Fargo’s season 5 premiere. Dot is arrested for unwittingly tazing a police officer during a brawl at a meeting of the town’s fall festival planning committee.
“Gloryland” by Ralph Stanley – This song is playing when Dot is processed at the police station and thrown in a holding cell. The lyrics present America as a land of hope and glory, which adds an ironic bite to the show’s depiction of America as a lawless wasteland where something as unsuspecting as a small-town fall festival planning committee can descend into violence.
“Hey Joe” by Charlotte Gainsbourg – Charlotte Gainsbourg’s cover version of the Jimi Hendrix classic “Hey Joe” plays as Dot dreams about Sheriff Tillman. The lyrics are all about a man who plans to kill a woman for cheating on him. This is similar to Dot’s connection to Sheriff Tillman, who wants to track her down for betraying him.
Fargo Season 5, Episode 2, ""Trials And Tribulations""
“Working Man” by Rush
by Rush “Paranoid” by Grand Funk Railroad
by Grand Funk Railroad “This is Halloween” by Marilyn Manson
“Working Man” by Rush – This rock ‘n’ roll gem plays as Sheriff Tillman takes a bath in a big barrel outside and puffs on a cigarette. The use of this song reflects how Tillman sees himself and presents himself to the community: an honest, blue-collar working stiff (when the reality is that he’s an iron-fisted tyrant).
“Paranoid” by Grand Funk Railroad – This song can be heard as Dot and Scotty rig the house with gruesome Home Alone-style booby traps; they glue broken glass to a door handle and suspend a sledgehammer over the front door. The funky beat adds to the hilarious juxtaposition of the creation of grisly deathtraps with a heartwarming mother-child bonding experience.
“This is Halloween” by Marilyn Manson – Marilyn Manson’s cover of this spooky Halloween-themed ditty from The Nightmare Before Christmas plays as Gator pulls into the gas station where Dot’s standoff with Ole Munch took place. This song ties into the fearmongering tactics that Gator uses in his attempts to enforce law and order. It also sets up the horror-like sequence of Gator finding his partner murdered.
Fargo Season 5, Episode 3, ""The Paradox Of Intermediate Transactions""
“Sixteen Tons” by Tennessee Ernie Ford
by Tennessee Ernie Ford “Bogey Wail” by Jack Hylton
by Jack Hylton “He’ll Have to Go” by Jim Reeves
by Jim Reeves “Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta” by Béla Bartók
by Béla Bartók “Smack My B**** Up” by The Prodigy
“Sixteen Tons” by Tennessee Ernie Ford – This folk classic about a coal miner can be heard in the opening scene of episode 3 as Tillman is driving late at night. Much like Rush’s “Working Man” in the last episode, this is another blue-collar anthem that ties into Tillman’s fabricated facade as an honest, hard-working, red-blooded American lawman. He listens to these songs because he believes they reflect his own life.
“Bogey Wail” by Jack Hylton – This spooky Halloween melody plays on the soundtrack as Dot sneaks around the neighborhood in the middle of the night and switches the road signs around to stop any more kidnappers with her address from finding the house. The creeping music pairs perfectly with the deviousness of Dot’s plan to throw the Tillmans off her tail.
“He’ll Have to Go” by Jim Reeves – This song can be heard as an elderly lady gets home with several six-packs of beer, cracks open a couple of the beers, and watches tennis on TV. The song’s whimsical tune gets deeper and creepier and more distorted (and eventually morphs into a tense orchestral score) as she hears footsteps upstairs and realizes there’s someone in her house.
“Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta” by Béla Bartók – This unsettling classical tune plays on the soundtrack as Ole Munch lies in bed listening to the police scanner, waiting for a clue as to where he can find the Tillmans. This piece has been used in movies and TV a few times; it’s best known for its appearance in The Shining when Danny Torrance is invited to sit on his dad’s lap.
“Smack My B**** Up” by The Prodigy – This controversial big beat classic can be heard as Gator and his crew head out in their van to find Dot’s house on Halloween night. Trick-or-treaters head out for Halloween festivities while Tillman lights a candle in the church and calls Dot’s landline. The violent themes of the lyrics link to the menacing intentions of Gator’s manhunt for Dot.
Fargo Season 5, Episode 4, ""Insolubilia""
“I Got You Babe” by Tiny Tim
“I Got You Babe” by Tiny Tim – Tiny Tim’s ukulele cover of the Sonny & Cher classic plays as Gator and his crew break into Dot’s house and search for her. This happy-go-lucky tune creates an unnerving juxtaposition over such a scary, suspenseful scene.
Fargo Season 5, Episode 5, ""The Tiger""
“Fargo, North Dakota” by Carter Burwell
“Fargo, North Dakota” by Carter Burwell – The main theme from the Coen brothers’ original Fargo movie plays at the end of the episode when Dot finally tells the truth to Olmstead and leaves Scotty to stay with her while she heads off to sort out the Tillman business.",2023-11-22T05:45:12Z,https://screenrant.com,Screen Rant
Camerawoman Sues Marilyn Manson For Spitting and Blowing Nose on Her,"A camerawoman, who claims Marilyn Manson caused her “fear and anxiety” after he spit and blew his nose on her at a concert, has revived her lawsuit against him.
Concert videographer and veteran photographer Susan Fountain claims that Manson approached her in the stage pit area during his show in Gilford, New Hampshire in August 2019.
According to a police affidavit, Manson, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, put his face close to Fountain’s camera and spit “a big lougee” at her. The videographer says that the gothic rock star’s saliva struck her arms and hands.
Fountain also accused Manson of approaching her a second time and blowing his nose on her arm and hands. The police report also notes that camera footage shows Manson “point and laugh at Fountain as she gets down and walks away.”
Rolling Stone reports that Fountain initially sued Manson in August 2021, making civil claims of assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress due to the alleged incident.
However, earlier this year, the case was dismissed by a judge after Fountain, failed to appear in court on the date the trial was to begin.
Fountain’s attorney, Jennifer A. Clingo, filed paperwork in March saying that she had been suffering from a serious medical issue and had simply failed to enter the trial date in her calendar — an error that was a first in her career.
According to Rolling Stone, Clingo appealed the dismissal on behalf of the videographer. On November 2, a judge ruled that the lawsuit against Manson could go ahead. The judge noted that Clingo has now “reduced her caseload and has prepared for management of her cases until she fully recovers.”
Neither Manson nor his lawyers attended the hearing on November 2.
In her original lawsuit, Fountain alleged that Manson “crouched down, leaned forward, and brought his face level with (her) camera lens before expelling “bodily fluids right onto her.”
Fountain says she felt shocked and humiliated after the alleged incident. The videographer says she rushed to a bathroom and washed her arms and legs.
The lawsuit claims that she later consulted a physician and underwent medical testing to ensure she had not contracted any communicable diseases. Fountain alleges that Manson previously stated on video that he had “swine flu just before he blew his nose on people on the stage.”
In September, Manson was fined and sentenced to 20 hours of community service after he pleaded no contest to spitting on and blowing his nose on Fountain.

Neue Doku über Marilyn Manson in der Mache,"Das britische Fernsehen lässt eine neue Doku über Marilyn Manson (54) produzieren. Wie der Sender Channel 4 mitteilt, habe man eine dreiteilige Dokureihe mit dem Titel ""Marilyn Manson: Behind the Mask"" (dt. ""Marilyn Manson: Hinter der Maske"") über den umstrittenen Rocker in Auftrag gegeben. Mitfinanziert von Fifth Season und in Zusammenarbeit mit Rolling Stone Films befinde sich die Dokumentation bereits in Produktion. Ein Erscheinungsdatum gibt es jedoch noch nicht.
Die Doku soll unter anderem den Weg Mansons, der bürgerlich Brian Warner heißt, ins Rampenlicht nachzeichnen und dessen Rolle als Rockstar beleuchten. Zudem stehen die Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen den Sänger mit im Vordergrund der Produktion.
Als erste hatte sich die Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (36), die mehrere Jahre mit Manson liiert war, Anfang 2021 mit schweren Vorwürfen gegen den Rocker an die Öffentlichkeit gewandt. Sie hatte damals Manson des Missbrauchs beschuldigt. Mehrere Frauen erhoben in der Folge weitere Anschuldigungen. Manson bestritt sämtliche Vorwürfe vehement. Eine Klage des Models Ashley Smithline gegen den Musiker war unter anderem laut des US-Magazins ""People"" Anfang 2023 abgewiesen worden.
Erst kürzlich sprach Wood im Podcast ""Navigating Narcissism"" über ihre Beziehung zu Manson. Sie habe ihn demnach damals davon überzeugt, sie gehen zu lassen. Die ""Westworld""-Darstellerin habe gefühlt, dass ""das im Grunde das war, was ich tun musste"". Wood habe den Sänger über Jahre studieren müssen, um ""sein Gaslighting und seine Manipulation"" zu verstehen. ""Und ich wusste einfach, dass ich da niemals rauskommen würde, wenn ich mich ihm entziehe oder es meine Entscheidung sein würde, zu fliehen."" Sie habe sich ""irgendwie tot stellen"" müssen, um ihm zu vermitteln, dass es seine Idee sei, sie gehen zu lassen.
""Ich habe solche Angst vor dieser Person. Ich wurde so oft bedroht, entweder mit Erpressung oder mit Gewalt - und wenn ich hier bleibe, weil ich zu viel Angst habe zu gehen, fühle ich mich sowieso wie tot"", sei damals Woods Gefühlslage gewesen. ""Bleiben hat sich wie eine Art Todesurteil angefühlt"", erklärt sie weiter. Aber auch zu gehen sei furchteinflößend gewesen, ""weil mir etwas zustoßen könnte oder er hinter mir her sein könnte"". Die Schauspielerin sei an den Punkt gekommen: ""So oder so fühle ich mich tot, also könnte ich genauso gut versuchen zu fliehen.""
In der neuen Dokumentation sollen demnach unter anderem mehrere Frauen, die Manson beschuldigt haben, zu Wort kommen. Daneben sollen Fans des Sängers, Insider aus der Musikindustrie, Anwälte, ein ehemaliger Bandkollege und der beste Kindheitsfreund des 54-Jährigen auftreten. Außerdem sollen exklusive Audioaufnahmen aus Interviews mit dem ""Rolling Stone""-Magazin, Archivmaterial und bisher unveröffentlichte Fotos vorliegen.

"Evan Rachel Wood victime de Marilyn Manson: ""Je me sentais morte""","L’actrice de 36 ans a décrit de façon glaçante les abus dont elle accuse son ex-compagnon et le «point de rupture» de leur relation.
Evan Rachel Wood et Marilyn Manson en 2007. imago images/T-F-Foto
Evan Rachel Wood a évoqué le «point de rupture» qui l’a amenée à révéler les abus dont elle accuse son ex-petit ami Marilyn Manson.
Devant le Congrès en 2018, l’actrice avait raconté ce qu’elle a subi, mais ce n’est qu’en 2021 qu’elle avait désigné le musicien , né Brian Warner, comme en étant l’auteur.
S’entretenant avec la psychologue clinicienne Ramani Durvasula dans le cadre du podcast «Navigating Narcissism», Evan Rachel Wood a expliqué pourquoi elle a rendu publiques ses affirmations – citant des crises de stress et le «poids de la situation» comme principales raisons.
«Lorsque j’ai réalisé l’impact physique que cela avait sur moi et qu’il m’était presque impossible d’avancer normalement, confortablement et en toute sécurité… C’est là que s’est produit le point de rupture pour moi», a déclaré la star de la série «Westworld».
Séparation en 2010
Le témoignage d’Evan Rachel Wood est intervenu l’année suivant l’explosion du mouvement #MeToo à Hollywood. La comédienne de 36 ans a expliqué à quel point elle avait peur de Marilyn Manson, 54 ans, avec qui elle a commencé à sortir alors qu’elle avait 19 ans et lui 37. «Je me suis dit que de toute façon je me sentais morte, alors autant essayer de m’échapper», a-t-elle confié. Le couple s’est séparé en 2010.
Evan Rachel Wood avait déjà évoqué ces abus dans le documentaire «Phoenix Rising», diffusé par HBO, et est allée plus loin pour le Dr Durvasula.
«Lavage de cerveau»
Elle a évoqué «un tas de cocaïne» et détaillé: «Il vous empêchait de dormir et restait éveillé en vous réprimandant, en vous disant tout ce qui n’allait pas dans le monde et chez les gens autour de vous, tout ce que vous faisiez mal, tout ce qui faisait que vous n’étiez pas à la hauteur ni pour lui ni pour vous-même, les soupçons qu’il avait à votre égard, et il commençait à détruire la maison.»
Et d’ajouter: «C’était un assaut continu de mots et de monologues, un flux constant de négativité auquel j’avais l’impression de ne pas pouvoir échapper et que je ne pouvais pas arrêter… C’est là que le lavage de cerveau et les abus ont commencé à se produire. Il ne s’arrêtait pas tant que vous n’aviez pas cédé, que vous finissiez par abonder dans son sens à tout ce qu’il disait, ou à passer les appels téléphoniques qu’il voulait que vous passiez.»

Marilyn Manson’s sex allegations part of explosive new Channel 4 documentary detailing his alleged crimes,"'BEHIND THE MASK' Marilyn Manson’s sex allegations part of explosive new Channel 4 documentary detailing his alleged crimes
AFTER probing serious claims against Russell Brand, Channel 4 is working on another investigation – this time into twisted rocker Marilyn Manson.
I can reveal it is making a documentary, Marilyn Manson: Behind the Mask, which will look at multiple allegations of sexual assault made against the US singer.

9 Channel 4's Dispatches investigated comedian Brand last month
The three-parter is being made by Lightbox, a production company founded by Simon Chinn, Oscar-winning producer of the 2012 documentary Searching For Sugar Man, about US singer Sixto Rodriguez.
Susan Lavery, of Lightbox, said of the new Manson investigation: “This tells the definitive story of the controversy surrounding the star, charting his career from its early days through to his being dropped by his manager, agent and record label as a result of the allegations made against him.
“In first-hand testimony, we hear intimate accounts from his accusers, as well as those who robustly refute their allegations.
“The series asks timely questions about how the music industry draws the line between rock and roll excess and transgressive behaviour.”
In February 2021 several women accused Manson — real name Brian Warner — of sexual assault, and within 24 hours his music career crumbled.
Later that year, an explosive article in Rolling Stone magazine laid bare a stream of allegations from several women that led to a police raid and a criminal investigation into Manson.
Five of his accusers launched civil lawsuits against him, claiming sexual assault and other offences, with retractions and out-of-court settlements illustrating how complicated the case against him is.
He denies any wrongdoing, and to date, no charges have been made, but civil cases are pending.
The new documentary, set to air next year, comes after last month’s Channel 4 Dispatches investigation into comedian Brand.
Made with The Times and The Sunday Times, the show revealed a string of sexual assault allegations against the comedian and presenter, all of which he has denied.

Talking on the Where There’s A Will, There’s A Wake podcast, he said: “It isn’t what it was.
“That doesn’t mean you don’t love each other as much.
“But it evolves into something else.
“Now, as middle-aged men, we’re really caring toward each other.
“Me sitting at home whingeing, ‘Why don’t he ever f***ing ring?’.
“I’ve never been like that. But its like, ‘OK, maybe I should ring him?’.
“I’m just grateful that we’re still in each other’s lives.”

Motsi is Strictly on merit
WHEN Motsi Mabuse got the job as judge on Strictly four years ago, there were a few people on social media who thought it was box-ticking by the BBC.
Although the South African was the first black person on the panel she came with a wealth of experience and was already a judge on German TV show, Let’s Dance.

Speaking on the Reign podcast she said: “What I really, really, really dislike is when people say: ‘Yeah she got it because she’s black or whatever’ it takes away from every black woman.
“It takes away my experience, my quality and everything I’ve been through.
“When you just see the label: ‘Oh she’s black’ or ‘First Strictly black judge’ it takes away 15 years of experience as a judge, it takes away 30 years of my experience as a dancer.”
I think most Strictly viewers love Motsi, and don’t give anything else a second thought.

Evan Rachel Wood Recounts Dark Details of Alleged Abuse by Marilyn Manson,"[Trigger warning: this article contains descriptions of domestic violence, as well as sexual and physical abuse.]
Evan Rachel Wood has further detailed what she said was the years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her ex-fiancé, disgraced shock rocker Marilyn Manson (born Brian Warner).
In a new interview with the Navigating Narcissism podcast, Wood broke down why it took her so many years to face the reality of the violence she says she endured during the relationship, telling host Dr. Ramani Durvasula that before the larger #MeToo movement gained traction in 2017, her nervous system, the stress and the “weight of it all” became so intense that the Westworld star began to have stress seizures.
“When I realized what a physical impact this was having on me and it was making it nearly impossible to just move about my life normally and comfortably and safely… that was such a breaking point for me,” Wood added.
Manson has repeatedly denied all accusations from Wood and several other women who have claimed that the singer engaged in ritual sexual, physical and mental abuse, with many of the lawsuits filed against him so far over the allegations either dropped, dismissed or settled. In addition, in May a Los Angeles judge dismissed much of Manson’s defamation lawsuit against Wood, ruling that many of its claims were barred under a California law aimed at protecting free speech.
Wood first began dating Manson when she was 18 and Manson was 37, describing the intense relationship in the 2022 HBO documentary Phoenix Rising in terms of the older musician immediately “lovebombing” her with notes and texts after their first meeting and describing her as his “soulmate” and himself as her “vampire.” In the film she alleged that Manson tied her up and tortured her ritualistically, lashing her to a “kneeler” bench and hitting her “over and over” with a Nazi whip from the Holocaust before shocking her welts and private areas until she broke the bench in half.
Though she didn’t mention Manson during 2018 testimony to Congress about her abuse, in February 2021 Wood for the first time named her abuser, writing, “I am here to expose this dangerous man” in reference to the performer whose stock-in-trade has been shocking audiences with graphic, disturbing images and lyrics and depicting himself as a debauched agent of chaos. In speaking to Durvasula, the actress said she essentially had to “play dead” and “give him something that was undesirable” in order to make it feel like it was Manson’s idea to let her go as part of her difficult attempt to separate from him.
“There was a moment where I was like, ‘I’m so afraid of this person, I’ve been threatened so many times, either with blackmail or with force and if I stay here because I’m too scared to leave, I feel like I’m dead anyway’,” Wood said. “Staying felt like a death sentence, leaving also felt terrifying because something could happen to me or he could come after me. I felt like either way I feel dead so I may as well try to escape,” she said of her decision to try and disentangle herself from the performer she said often behaved in a “cult leader” fashion.
Describing “reactive abuse” where she said Manson pushed her to the edge of a breakdown — including one time where she claimed the singer told someone in his inner circle that she had slit her wrists “for attention” — Wood said Manson would try to “get ahead” of any allegations against him by putting out a “completely different” story to pre-empt her claims.
She further detailed what she has said was the abusive behavior she suffered while living with Manson during the relationship that lasted until she was 22, including him allegedly isolating her from others for days on end, escalating threats and her “getting in trouble” for such perceived slip-ups as giving guests water in plastic bottles instead of glasses.
“You and him and a mound of cocaine and he would keep you up and stay awake just berating you,” Wood said, “telling you everything that was wrong with the world and the people around you, everything you were doing wrong, all the ways you were failing him and failing yourself, the suspicions he had towards you, he would start wrecking the house. It was this non-stop onslaught of words and monologues, this constant stream of negativity that I felt like I couldn’t escape and couldn’t stop… it’s where the brainwashing and abuse started taking place. He wouldn’t stop until you gave in or started agreeing with everything he was saying or making the phone calls he wanted you to make.”
Wood described the yearslong process of healing from the trauma of the relationship, saying that while she was initially being “groomed” by Manson as they were going public, the reaction she saw was “very shaming and very blaming,” with the attention seemingly focused solely on her and not Warner. “Here’s this like sort of young harlot Lolita-type home wrecking party girl that’s come in and ruined everything,” she said of how she perceived the relationship was being described, rather than a focus on how much older Manson was and whether it was “somewhat inappropriate” for the then-married singer to be pursuing her; Manson was married to burlesque performer Dita Von Teese from 2004-2007.
Elsewhere, Wood said Manson coerced her into splitting with her mother — allegedly taking notes on her conversations with her mom — as a further attempt to isolate her and, as she said is typical with cults, convince her to not believe negative things she read about him. “Cults do the same thing when they’re like, ‘don’t read anything about the cult online’… it’s the same kind of psychology of up is down and down is up.”
She said at one point Manson demanded Wood kick her lifelong best friend out of her house, sending one of his “flying monkeys” (his assistant) with her, and having that person record the interaction so that he could confirm Wood had done what he told her to as part of his desire to control her actions.
At press time a spokesperson for Manson had not responded to Billboard‘s request for comment on Wood’s interview, though a source close to the singer said that “most of the false claims” made by Wood in her interview “have already been disputed within Brian’s ongoing lawsuit against her, and that the “new tales she is spinning” will likely be added to that case as well.
In a previous filing related to Manson’s defamation suit against Wood, he stated that he was in a romantic relationship with the actress until 2010 — after meeting her in 2006 — that they were engaged to be married and during that time they “carried on a loving and consensual relationship. Eventually, like many couples, we broke up. I never abused, assaulted, raped, or threatened Wood or her family as she has since contended”; Manson stated that any accusations of abuse, assault, rape or threats are “unequivocally false.”

Missbrauchsvorwurf: Marilyn Manson einigt sich mit Klägerin,"Marilyn Manson (54) muss vorerst nicht vor Gericht! Der Sänger wurde in den vergangenen Jahren von vielen Frauen wegen sexueller Nötigung angezeigt. Im Jahr 2021 verklagte ihn unter anderem eine Frau namens Jane Doe. Sie beschuldigte den ""Sweet Dreams""-Interpreten, sie 2011 sexuell missbraucht und gequält zu haben. Knapp zweieinhalb Jahre später kommt es nun zur Einigung zwischen Marilyn und Jane.
Wie Rollling Stone berichtet, sollte der Prozess nächste Woche eigentlich vor Gericht beginnen. Der Anwalt der Frau reichte vorab jedoch eine Mitteilung über einen Vergleich ein. Demnach konnten sich Marilyn und Jane außergerichtlich einigen. ""Ich war voll und ganz auf den Prozess vorbereitet und hätte nie gedacht, dass ich jemals einen Vergleich schließen würde, aber in den letzten zweieinhalb Jahren habe ich stillschweigend Drohungen, Schikanen, Belästigungen und verschiedene Formen der Einschüchterung ertragen, die sich in den letzten Wochen noch verstärkt haben"", erklärte die Klägerin gegenüber dem Magazin.
""Ich habe mich nie um Geld gekümmert und wollte immer nur Gerechtigkeit, aber wenn wir vor Gericht gegangen wären, hätte ich mein Recht auf Anonymität verlieren können und wäre in großem und öffentlichem Umfang als Opfer beschuldigt worden"", fügt sie hinzu. Die genauen Bedingungen des Vergleichs wurden bisher nicht öffentlich gemacht.

Marilyn Manson Settles Rape Lawsuit,"A week before trial was set to start, Marilyn Manson has reached a settlement with a woman who sued him for rape, Billboard can confirm.
Adam Wolf, the attorney for the woman known only as “Jane Doe,” filed the notice of settlement in Los Angeles court on Wednesday (Sept. 27). The lawyer will submit a request to dismiss the case within 45 days.
“Brian is pleased that, just as previous lawsuits were abandoned without payment or settled for pennies on the dollar, this plaintiff has now agreed to drop her suit in exchange for an insurance payment representing a fraction of her demands and far less than the cost to Brian of proceeding to trial,” Manson’s attorney Howard King shared in a press statement.
Following the news, Doe told Rolling Stone in a statement, “I was fully prepared for trial and never in a million years thought I would ever settle, but over the past two-and-a-half years I have silently endured threats, bullying, harassment and various forms of intimidation that have intensified over the past few weeks.” She noted that Manson attended her deposition and that she was “forced to answer seven hours of aggressive questioning with him staring at me from across the table.” She continued, “I’ve been told that this almost never happens, as it’s cruel, and that a main reason for it would be to intimidate and inflict emotional distress on a victim.”
“I never cared about money and only ever wanted justice, but if we had gone to trial, I could have lost my right to anonymity and been victim-blamed on a large and public scale,” she added. “Most importantly I could have risked losing the freedom to tell my story, and that is worth more than anything in the world.”
Doe initially filed a lawsuit against Manson (real name Brian Warner) in June 2021 for allegedly raping and torturing her in 2011. In the complaint, she claimed that for 10 years, she had repressed memories of being raped by Manson and only recovered them in February 2021 when other women stepped forward with accusations against him.
The woman’s complaint further claimed that following the alleged assault, Manson threatened to kill her, saying he would “bash her head in.” It went on to state that he said he would “get away with it” because he was a “celebrity who had contacts with the police.” She also alleged that Manson kept in almost constant contact with her and deprived her of food, claiming he told her “that because she was his girlfriend, she needed to lose weight because her weight embarrassed him.”
In September 2021, however, the lawsuit was dismissed by Judge Gregory Keosian, who stated that the accuser’s claims of repressed memories were “not sufficient” to overrule the two-year statute of limitations. While Keosian stated that the claim of repressed memories “is common for sexual assault victims,” he ruled that more was needed to invoke California’s “delayed-discovery” rule. The rule effectively postpones the start date of the statute of limitations if the plaintiff can prove that they first became aware of the injury within two years of filing their complaint, regardless of when the incident itself took place. The judge gave her 20 days from the ruling to amend and refile her complaint, and it was refiled eight days later with more information about her repressed memories.
Over the past two years, Manson has been hit with sexual assault lawsuits by multiple women, including Game of Thrones actress and former girlfriend Esme Bianco, his former personal assistant Ashley Walters and ex-girlfriend Ashley Morgan Smithline. The lawsuits filed by Walters and Smithline have since been dismissed, while Manson settled with Bianco in January. Smithline later recanted her accusations and claimed that Manson’s former girlfriend, Evan Rachel Wood — whose initial allegation of sexual abuse by Manson in February 2021 opened up a tidal wave of similar claims against the singer — had pressured her to make the claim, which Wood later denied. Smithline’s recantation tied in with a March 2022 defamation lawsuit Manson had filed against Wood that accused the actress of launching an “organized attack” against him, but a judge dismissed much of that lawsuit this past May.

Marilyn Manson sentenced to fine and community service,"In 2019, Marilyn Manson was accused of spitting and blowing his nose on a camerawoman during a concert in New Hampshire.
Blowing his nose on a camerawoman isn’t the most heinous act Marilyn Manson has been associated with, but it was enough for a New Hampshire judge to sentence him to 20 hours of community service and a fine of 1400 dollars on Monday. This sanction follows an incident in 2019, in which the singer was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault for spitting and blowing his nose on videographer Susan Fountain during a concert.
The judge called Manson’s actions ” shocking “. In 2021, the musician initially pleaded not guilty to both charges. Prosecutors dismissed the spitting charge and the musician, born Brian Warner, pleaded no lo contendere for the accusation of blowing my nose. Thanks to this negotiated agreement, he does not admit his guilt but avoids a trial, where each count would have resulted in a prison sentence and a heavier fine.
“ I understand that this was not a significant criminal charge to begin with, but I was hoping that the accused would receive a sentence that would make him think twice before doing something like that again, Ms Fountain said in a letter read to the court on Monday. The videographer, who has a 30-year career, added: “ In all the years I have worked with people, I have never been humiliated or treated the way I was by this defendant. Him spitting on me and blowing his nose is the most disgusting thing a human being has ever done. »
During the 2019 concert, Manson allegedly approached Fountain in the pit area of ​​the stage, where she was stationed to take photographs. The police affidavit, according to Associated Presssays he then moved his face towards her camera and spat on her hands before returning later to kneel in front of her and blow ” a significant amount of mucus » on his arms and hands. Then he allegedly pointed at Fountain and laughed at her as she walked away.
Manson is required to avoid arrest and alert local police of any performances in New Hampshire for the next two years.

Marilyn Manson é condenado por 'assoar nariz' em cinegrafista,"O ícone do rock Marilyn Manson, cujo nome real é Brian Warner, foi condenado nesta segunda-feira (18), após um incidente que ocorreu durante um show em 2019, no estado de New Hampshire, nos Estados Unidos. Manson foi condenado a cumprir 20 horas de serviço comunitário e a pagar uma multa por ter assoado o nariz em uma cinegrafista.
As acusações contra Manson incluíam duas contravenções de agressão simples, relacionadas a um incidente com a cameraman durante uma apresentação no Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion, em Gilford, em 19 de agosto de 2019. Em um acordo negociado com os promotores, Manson não contestou a acusação de ""assoar o nariz"" na cinegrafista, enquanto a acusação de que ele cuspiu na mulher foi rejeitada pela promotoria.
Nesta segunda-feira, Manson entrou no tribunal usando um terno preto e óculos escuros, identificando-se como Brian Warner com uma voz suave. Durante a audiência, ele apenas respondeu ""sim"" às perguntas do juiz, não fazendo qualquer declaração. O procurador destacou que essa foi a primeira infração de Manson e que ele não possuía antecedentes criminais. A cinegrafista não estava presente no tribunal.
Inicialmente, Manson havia se declarado inocente das duas acusações em 2021, e seu julgamento estava programado para ocorrer em agosto. A defesa recorreu e, como parte do novo acordo, Manson foi multado em pouco mais de US$ 1,4 mil (cerca de R$ 6,8 mil na cotação atual). Além disso, ele deve se manter livre de detenções e notificar a polícia local sobre suas atividades em New Hampshire durante os próximos dois anos.
O juiz permitiu que Manson cumprisse suas 20 horas de serviço comunitário na Califórnia e sugeriu que ele poderia escolher trabalhar com pessoas em programas de reabilitação. Manson tem até o dia 4 de fevereiro para apresentar evidências de seu serviço comunitário.
O incidente em questão envolveu Marilyn Manson se aproximando da cinegrafista Susan Fountain, expelindo saliva na câmera dela e, posteriormente, assoando o nariz, com o muco caindo em suas mãos.
Fountain descreveu o ato como ""a coisa mais nojenta que um ser humano poderia ter feito"". Um sargento da polícia que analisou o vídeo do show afirmou que Manson ""soprou uma quantidade significativa de ranho em Fountain"" e que o cantor apontou e riu dela enquanto ela se afastava. Marilyn Manson é conhecido por sua música polêmica e sucesso nas décadas de 1990 e 2000. (Folhapress)",2023-09-20T11:45:13Z,https://www.otempo.com.br,O Tempo

"Marilyn Manson pleads no contest in New Hampshire to blowing nose on videographer, gets fine, community service","Entertainment Marilyn Manson pleads no contest in New Hampshire to blowing nose on videographer, gets fine, community service Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from the encounter with the videographer at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford on Aug. 19, 2019.

LACONIA, N.H. (AP) — Marilyn Manson was sentenced to 20 hours of community service and a fine on Monday after pleading no contest to blowing his nose on a videographer at a 2019 concert in New Hampshire.
The shock rocker, 54, wanted to appear via video for his hearing on the misdemeanor charge, but the judge required him to be in the courtroom in Laconia, about 30 miles north of Concord, the state capital.
Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from the encounter with the videographer at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford on Aug. 19, 2019.

Manson pleaded no contest to just the nose-blowing charge in a fully negotiated plea agreement with prosecutors. The prosecutors agreed to dismiss the other charge, which alleged that he spit on the videographer. A no contest plea means Manson is not contesting the charge and does not admit guilt.
Manson was fined a little more than $1,400 as part of the deal, with $200 suspended. He needs to remain arrest-free and notify local police of any New Hampshire performances for two years.
The judge, who called Manson’s acts “egregious,” agreed to allow Manson to do his community service in California. Manson mentioned to reporters that he might choose to work with people in recovery. He has to give proof of his community service by Feb. 4.
According to a police affidavit, Manson approached videographer Susan Fountain in the venue’s stage pit area, put his face close to her camera and spit a “big lougee” at her. She was struck on both hands with saliva. He approached her again later, kneeling and covering one nostril before blowing the other on her arms and hands.
Manson “blows a significant amount of mucous at Fountain,” a police sergeant who reviewed concert video footage said in the affidavit. After that, the camera view changes and people can see Manson “point and laugh at Fountain as she gets down and walks away,” the affidavit said.

After that, the camera view changes to another one and people can see Manson “point and laugh” etc.
Fountain was not in court, but submitted a statement that was read aloud.
“For me, I’m a professional person and I’ve been in this industry for 30 years. I’ve worked for a lot of companies, and in all the years I’ve worked with people, I’ve never been humiliated or treated the way I was by this defendant,” it read. “For him to spit on me and blow his nose on me was the most disgusting thing a human being has ever done.
“I understand this was not a big criminal charge to begin with, but I was hoping that the defendant would receive a sentence that would make him think twice before doing something like this again,” the statement read.
Monday, Manson walked into the main entrance of the courthouse, through security. He was wearing a suit, dressed head to toe in black, and dark sunglasses. Security staff referred to him as “Mr. Warner,” and he identified himself in court as “Brian Warner,” using a soft speaking voice.
He otherwise only answered “yes” to the judge’s questions asking if he understood the proceeding, and made no statement. Prosecutor Andrew Livernois said it was his first offense and he had no prior record.

Manson initially pleaded not guilty to both charges in 2021. He was scheduled to go to trial in August. His lawyer had said that the type of filming Fountain was doing commonly exposes videographers to “incidental contact” with bodily fluids.
“The defendant’s performance for the past twenty years are well known to include shocking and evocative antics similar to those that occurred here,” attorney Kent Barker wrote. “The alleged victim consented to exposing herself to potential contact with sweat, saliva and phlegm in close quarters.”
Barker also had said Manson planned to argue that any contact related to spitting or sneezing was unintentional.
If Manson had gone to trial on the charges, each could have resulted in a jail sentence of less than a year and a $2,000 fine if convicted.
Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like “The Beautiful People” and hit album’s like 1996’s “Antichrist Superstar” and 1998’s “Mechanical Animals.”
In May, a California judge threw out key sections of Manson’s lawsuit against his former fiancee, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, claiming she fabricated public allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship and encouraged other women to do the same. He is appealing the ruling.
Manson’s suit, filed last year, alleges that Wood and another woman named as a defendant, Illma Gore, defamed Manson, intentionally caused him emotional distress and derailed his career in music, TV and film.

Several women have sued Manson in recent years with allegations of sexual and other abuse. Most have been dismissed or settled, including a suit filed by “Game of Thrones” actor Esme Bianco.
The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly.

Marilyn Manson Gets Fine and Community Service in Misdemeanor Simple Assault Case,"Marilyn Manson has been sentenced to 20 hours of community service and a fine of about $1,400 for spitting and blowing his nose on a concert videographer, The Associated Press reports. The incident took place at a 2019 concert in Gilford, New Hampshire. Manson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor simple assault charge after turning himself in to authorities some 18 months after his arrest warrant was issued.
In a court statement read in her absence, the videographer, Susan Fountain, said, “I’ve never been humiliated or treated like I was by this defendant. For him to spit on me and blow his nose on me was the most disgusting thing a human being has ever done.” The judge described the assault as “egregious,” according to The Associated Press.
Manson must also alert police to any concerts planned for New Hampshire for the next two years and complete his community service by Sunday, February 4, 2024. He is permitted to carry out the service in California, where he resides.

Marilyn Manson Fined for Spitting and Blowing His Nose on Camerawoman,"Marilyn Manson has been sentenced in court after he pleaded no contest to spitting on and blowing his nose on a videographer during one of his concerts in New Hampshire.
The gothic rock star, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, was fined and sentenced to 20 hours of community service for the incident that happened in 2019 at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford on August 19.
The 54-year-old had requested to appear via video for his court hearing on the misdemeanor charge, but the judge deemed it essential that he physically attend the court in Laconia. Manson wore an all-black suit and dark sunglasses and only spoke to the judge twice; once to acknowledge his name and once to indicate he understood the sentence.
Police in New Hampshire investigating the incident said that Manson put his face close to photographer Susan Fountain’s camera and spat a “big lougee” at her which landed on both hands.
Manson then returned just moments later when he kneeled over Fountain, closed one of his nostrils by placing his hand on it, and then launched a “significant amount of mucus” onto the camerawoman’s arms and hands.
The police report also notes that camera footage shows Manson “point and laugh at Fountain as she gets down and walks away.”
“I’ve never been humiliated or treated like I was by this defendant,” Fountain said while reading out a statement in court. “For him to spit on me and blow his nose on me was the most disgusting thing a human being has ever done.”
As well as the 20 hours of community service, Manson must also make New Hampshire police aware of any concerts he has planned in the state for the next two years. Manson must carry out his community service by no later than February 4, 2024.
The singer, whose hits include The Beautiful People and Tainted Love, was also fined $1,400 — $200 of which is suspended. The judge will allow Manson to carry out his community service in California. He later told reporters outside of court that he plans to work with “people in recovery” as part of his service.

Marilyn Manson: Rock star fined for blowing nose on camera operator in 2019 concert,"Rock star Marilyn Manson has been fined and sentenced to 20 hours of community service after pleading no contest to blowing his nose on a camera operator during a concert.
The 54-year-old, who's real name is Brian Warner, appeared in court on Monday and was charged with two misdemeanour counts of simple assault following the incident during a 2019 concert in New Hampshire.
Manson pleaded no contest to the charge of nose-blowing, meaning he does not contest the charge, but does not admit guilt.
The plea was part of a deal that saw prosecutors agree to dismiss the other charge against the musician, which alleged that he spat on the camera operator.

He was fined just over $1,400 (£1,131) with $200 (£161) suspended, and needs to stay arrest-free while also notifying local police of any New Hampshire performances for two years.
During the New Hampshire concert, Manson approached the camera operator, Susan Fountain, put his face close to her camera and spat a ""big lougee"" at her, according to a police affidavit.
A police sergeant who reviewed the video footage said in the affidavit that Manson blew a ""significant amount of mucus at Fountain"", and that after the camera view changes, you can see Manson ""point and laugh at Fountain as she gets down and walks away"".

Ms Fountain said in a statement that the incident was ""the most disgusting thing a human being could have done"".
Manson initially pleaded not guilty to both charges in 2021, with the rock star's lawyer claiming the type of filming that Ms Fountain was doing at the concert commonly exposes videographers to ""incidental contact"" with bodily fluids.

«Εξοργιστικό περιστατικό»
Ο 54χρονος Manson είχε αρχικά δηλώσει αθώος στις κατηγορίες για την επίθεση, όμως αργότερα άλλαξε την απολογία του. Όπως αναφέρει έκθεση της αστυνομίας ο Manson έφτυσε την εικονολήπτρια στις 19 Αυγούστου του 2019, ενώ βιντεοσκοπούσε την εμφάνισή του στο Pavillion της Bank of New Hampshire στο Γκίλφορντ. Ο επιθεωρητής της αστυνομίας, που έλεγξε τις εικόνες από το συμβάν, είπε ότι ο Manson εθεάθη να πλησιάζει το πρόσωπό του στην κάμερα που κρατούσε η Σούζαν Φάουντεν και να τη φτύνει. Αμέσως μετά γονάτισε πάνω της και φύσηξε τη μύτη του.

Marilyn Manson Fined For Spitting ‘Big Lougee’ at Camerawoman,"Marilyn Manson was sentenced to 20 hours of community service and fined by a court on Monday (Sept. 17) after pleading no contest to blowing his nose on a camerawoman at a 2019 concert in New Hampshire.
The controversial artist (real name: Brian Warner) was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault, relating to an incident with the videographer during a show at Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford.
Manson had initially pleaded not guilty to the assault charges, but later changed his plea to no contest, the BBC reports, which means the goth-rocker was not contesting the charge but does not admit guilt.
The judge required Manson to appear in court, and described the incident in question as “egregious.” Manson was fined about $1,400, with $200 suspended, and will be allowed to complete his community service in California, as requested.

According to a police affidavit, the Associated Press reports, Manson approached videographer Susan Fountain in the stage pit, and spat a “big lougee” at her. Later, he is said to have returned, kneeling and covering one nostril before blowing the other on her arms and hands.
Manson “blows a significant amount of mucous at Fountain,” a police sergeant who reviewed concert video footage said in the report. The camera then captures Manson “point and laugh at Fountain as she gets down and walks away,” reads the affidavit.
Manson reportedly wore a black suit in court, and spoke twice to the judge: to acknowledge his name and to confirm “yes” when asked if he understood the sentence.
Fountain did not attend court, but prepared a statement. “For me, I’m a professional person and I’ve been in this industry for 30 years. I’ve worked for a lot of companies, and in all the years I’ve worked with people, I’ve never been humiliated or treated the way I was by this defendant,” it reads. “For him to spit on me and blow his nose on me was the most disgusting thing a human being has ever done.
“I understand this was not a big criminal charge to begin with, but I was hoping that the defendant would receive a sentence that would make him think twice before doing something like this again,” the statement continues.
Manson has been the subject of sexual assault and abuse allegations from multiple women, including Evan Rachel Wood, Esmé Bianco, Ashley Waters, Illma Gore and others. Despite those claims, which Manson has denied, the artist returned from a social media hiatus earlier this year to seemingly tease new music.
Manson has achieved 10 top 10 titles on the Billboard 200 chart, including No. 1s with 1998’s Mechanical Animals and 2013’s The Golden Age Of Grotesque.

Manson, il cui nome legale è Brian Warner, è stato accusato di due reati di aggressione derivanti dall'incontro con la videomaker presso il padiglione della Bank of New Hampshire a Gilford il 19 agosto 2019. Il giudice ha definito gli atti di Manson ""vergognosi"" e concesso al rocker di svolgere il suo servizio alla comunità in California, nei prossimi mesi.

Sputi e muco sulla donna Secondo una dichiarazione giurata della polizia, Manson si è avvicinato alla videomaker nell'area del palco, ha avvicinato il viso alla telecamera e le ha sputato addosso. La donna è stata colpita con la saliva su entrambe le mani. Il rocker si è poi avvicinato di nuovo a lei, prima di soffiarsi il naso sulle braccia e sulle mani. Manson ""soffia una notevole quantità di muco a Fountain"", ha detto nella dichiarazione giurata un sergente di polizia che ha esaminato le riprese video del concerto. Poco dopo nel video si vede Manson ""indicare e ridere di Fountain mentre scende e si allontana"", ha continuato il sergente.
""La cosa più disgustosa della mia vita"" Fountain non era in tribunale, ma ha presentato una dichiarazione letta ad alta voce. ""Sono una professionista e lavoro in questo settore da 30 anni. Ho lavorato per molte aziende e in tutti gli anni in cui ho lavorato con le persone non sono mai stato umiliata o trattata nel modo in cui mi ha trattata l'imputato"", si legge. ""Sputarmi e soffiare il naso è stata la cosa più disgustosa che un essere umano abbia mai fatto. Capisco che non si trattasse di una grossa accusa penale, ma spero che l'imputato possa ricevere una sentenza che lo faccia riflettere due volte prima di fare di nuovo qualcosa del genere"".

Marilyn Manson pleads no contest to blowing nose on videographer,"LACONIA, N.H. (AP) — Marilyn Manson was sentenced to 20 hours of community service and a fine on Monday after pleading no contest to blowing his nose on a videographer at a 2019 concert in New Hampshire.
The shock rocker, 54, wanted to appear via video for his hearing on the misdemeanor charge, but the judge required him to be in the courtroom in Laconia, about 30 miles north of Concord, the state capital.
Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from the encounter with the videographer at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford on Aug. 19, 2019.
Manson pleaded no contest to just the nose-blowing charge in a fully negotiated plea agreement with prosecutors. The prosecutors agreed to dismiss the other charge, which alleged that he spit on the videographer. A no contest plea means Manson is not contesting the charge and does not admit guilt.
Manson was fined a little more than $1,400 as part of the deal, with $200 suspended. He needs to remain arrest-free and notify local police of any New Hampshire performances for two years.

The judge, who called Manson’s acts “egregious,” agreed to allow Manson to do his community service in California. Manson mentioned to reporters that he might choose to work with people in recovery. He has to give proof of his community service by Feb. 4.
According to a police affidavit, Manson approached videographer Susan Fountain in the venue’s stage pit area, put his face close to her camera and spit a “big lougee” at her. She was struck on both hands with saliva. He approached her again later, kneeling and covering one nostril before blowing the other on her arms and hands.
Manson “blows a significant amount of mucous at Fountain,” a police sergeant who reviewed concert video footage said in the affidavit. After that, the camera view changes and people can see Manson “point and laugh at Fountain as she gets down and walks away,” the affidavit said.

I’ve worked for a lot of companies, and in all the years I’ve worked with people, I’ve never been humiliated or treated the way I was by this defendant,” it read. “For him to spit on me and blow his nose on me was the most disgusting thing a human being has ever done.

Barker also had said Manson planned to argue that any contact related to spitting or sneezing was unintentional.

Marilyn Manson gets community service for blowing his nose on a concert videographer,"LACONIA, N.H. — Marilyn Manson was sentenced to 20 hours of community service and a fine on Monday after pleading no contest to blowing his nose on a videographer at a 2019 concert in New Hampshire.
The shock rocker, 54, wanted to appear via video for his hearing on the misdemeanor charge, but the judge required him to be in the courtroom in Laconia, about 30 miles north of Concord, the state capital.
Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from the encounter with the videographer at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford on Aug. 19, 2019.
Manson pleaded no contest to just the nose-blowing charge in a fully negotiated plea agreement with prosecutors. The prosecutors agreed to dismiss the other charge, which alleged that he spit on the videographer. A no contest plea means Manson is not contesting the charge and does not admit guilt.
Manson was fined a little more than $1,400 as part of the deal, with $200 suspended. He needs to remain arrest-free and notify local police of any New Hampshire performances for two years.
The judge agreed to allow Manson to serve his community service in California. He mentioned to reporters that he might choose to work with people in recovery. Manson has to give proof of his community service by Feb. 4.

Fountain said via a statement that it “the most disgusting thing a human being could have done.”

Lisa Marie Presley Was in a Music Video With Marilyn Manson and Courtney Love,"If you look around hard enough, you can find connections between any two people in the music industry. For example, Elvis Presley’s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, once appeared in a music video with Marilyn Manson and Courtney Love. Lisa Marie played a memorably menacing role in the clip.
Lisa Marie Presley liked getting to bite Marilyn Manson ‘hard’ in a music video
Blabbermouth.net quotes a 2003 interview Lisa Marie did with MSN. In it, she called Manson a friend and cited him as one of her musical influences. Lisa Marie was nervous upon first meeting him because she was such a fan of his. She also praised his then-recent album, The Golden Age of Grotesque, which includes the hits “Mobscene” and “This Is the New S***.”
Lisa Marie later appeared in the music video for Manson’s 2018 single “Tattooed in Reverse.” In a 2018 Facebook post, she wrote “Love shooting Marilyn Manson new video ‘Tattooed In Reverse’ it was fun and I got to bite him … hard.” Lisa Marie and Love both play nurses in the music video.
Warning: Explicit content
Lisa Marie Presley works in a Satanic hospital in the music video
Manson’s videos are often abstract, but “Tattooed in Reverse” is relatively easy to follow. In the clip, a patient wakes up in a hospital where occult rites are going on. At one point, Lisa Marie angrily attacks Manson with medical equipment.
Lisa Marie didn’t often collaborate with other artists. For this reason, “Tattooed in Reverse” remains one of the most memorable moments of her career.
Related This Marilyn Manson Song Is Supposed to Sound Like Elvis Presley
Marilyn Manson has some major similarities to Elvis Presley
“Tattooed in Reverse” appeared on Manson’s album Heaven Upside Down. During a 2017 interview with Bloody Disgusting, Manson discussed his provocative intentions for the album. “I want to remind people that music is dangerous,” he said. “I always found it really strange that [people who] blamed me for what my music supposedly had inspired … were never afraid of what I would do. ‘Well, he makes music that causes violence.’ They weren’t afraid of me, they were afraid of my music and that seems sort of a**-backward.
“I just want to remind people that they forgot that there’s s*** that’s way worse than what they are busy talking about or watching on TV,” he added. “It’s not me, but I’m here to precipitate change of some sort. I won’t change the world, [I’m] just trying to cause and effect. I’ve definitely made a dent in the industry of rock ‘n’ roll that I can be satisfied with and say, ‘OK, I did that, ‘but that’s not enough. One dent is not enough.”
Manson isn’t that far off from what the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll was doing in the 1950s. The “Hound Dog” singer also scandalized puritans with his provocative live performances and made a huge dent in the music industry. It’s fitting that Manson got to work with Lisa Marie.
Manson and Lisa Marie were both icons and they gave us a deliciously spooky collaboration.",2023-09-07T15:00:57Z,https://www.cheatsheet.com,Showbiz Cheat Sheet

Several women have sued Manson in recent years with allegations of sexual and other abuse. Most have been dismissed or settled, including a suit filed by ""Game of Thrones"" actor Esme Bianco.

Marilyn Manson to plead no contest to blowing his nose on videographer,"Marilyn Manson will plead no contest to blowing his nose on a videographer at a 2019 concert, according to his lawyer.
The rock star, whose legal name is Brian Warner, was charged with two misdemeanour counts of simple assault stemming from the encounter at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion on August 19, 2019.

A notice of intent has been filed saying that Manson is expected to plead no contest to only one charge, and that prosecutors would dismiss the other in the fully negotiated plea.

A no contest plea means Manson will not contest the charge and does not admit guilt.

Manson would face a sentence of a 1,200 US dollar (£916) fine with part of it suspended and 20 hours of community service within six months.

Manson would also need to avoid being arrested and notify local police of any performances in New Hampshire for two years.
A judge would have to accept the plea, which is expected to be entered on Thursday in Belknap County Superior Court. That is in place of a final pre-trial hearing that was scheduled in advance of his planned trial on August 7.
It is not clear whether Manson would be required to be in court or be allowed to participate via video. His lawyer, Kent Barker, said it would be up to the judge.

According to a police affidavit, Manson approached videographer Susan Fountain in the venue’s stage pit area, put his face close to her camera and spit a “big lougee” at her. She was struck on both hands with saliva.
He is also accused of approaching her a second time and blowing his nose on her arm and hands.
Prosecutors planned to dismiss the charge stemming from the first encounter, according to the notice.
Manson initially pleaded not guilty in 2021. His lawyer had said at the time that the type of filming Ms Fountain was doing commonly exposes videographers to “incidental contact” with bodily fluids.

“The defendant’s performance for the past 20 years are well known to include shocking and evocative antics similar to those that occurred here,” Mr Barker wrote. “The alleged victim consented to exposing herself to potential contact with sweat, saliva and phlegm in close quarters.”

Mr Barker also said Manson planned to argue that any contact related to spitting or sneezing was unintentional.
If Manson had gone to trial on the charges, each could have resulted in a jail sentence of less than a year and a 2,000 dollar (£1,529) fine if convicted.
Manson has also faced abuse accusations unrelated to the New Hampshire allegation in recent years. He has denied wrongdoing.

"Fête de la musique: qui sont Les Soutanes of Swing, le groupe en concert ""pour Jésus"" à Toulon?","En matière de rock, les références se trouvent en général plutôt du côté du malin que du royaume des cieux.
D’Elvis Presley à Marilyn Manson, en passant par les Rolling Stones et leur mythique Sympathy for the devil, on ne compte plus les chansons énervées ou poétiques qui évoquent le diable… sans même parler de tout un tas de pratiques pas très catholiques.
Avec le groupe Les Soutanes of Swing, en concert ce mercredi soir à Toulon dans le cadre de la fête de la musique, c’est l’inverse.
Sur scène: une dizaine de musiciens, dont plus de la moitié en tenue religieuse. Et des reprises de classiques du rock et de la variété qui intègrent des paroles pieuses.
Ainsi, Que je t’aime de Johnny devient Que je t’aime, ô Marie. Des psaumes sont aussi repris sur des airs de Pink Floyd, Louise Attaque ou encore Goldman.

""Plus que d’évangéliser, notre volonté est de témoigner de notre foi à travers la musique, explique Géraud de la Bourdonnaye, le saxophoniste. L’objectif est aussi d’offrir l’image d’une église rayonnante. De montrer qu’on peut être en soutane, avoir choisi une vie particulière et malgré tout faire la fête et enflammer les foules. En somme, s’inscrire dans le monde.""

S’il subsiste peu de doute sur la qualité de leur engagement au service de Dieu, quid côté musique? ""On est bon, poursuit Géraud, sans sourciller. Il y a deux chanteurs, une batterie, un violon, une guitare, une trompette et notre rock star: le père Jérôme Dernoncourt.""
Les membres évoluent, le nom aussi. Les Grenouilles de bénitier se sont ainsi récemment rebaptisés en détournant le nom de la chanson Sultans of Swing du groupe Dire Straits.

MeToo in der Rockmusik: Was sagt uns der Fall Marilyn Manson über den Fall Till Lindemann?,"Während sich der Fall Till Lindemann weiterentwickelt, erleben viele Beobachter*innen einen Déjà-vu-Effekt. Er rührt vom bisher größten MeToo-Skandal in der US-amerikanischen Rockbranche, dem Fall Marilyn Manson. Zwar unterscheiden sich die Vorgänge stark, aber weil beide Sänger ein ähnliches Provokations- und Schockkonzept haben und sich den Vorwürfen mehrerer Frauen gegenübersehen, die Grenzen ihrer Gewaltfantasien in der Realität überschritten zu haben, drängt sich die Erinnerung derzeit so stark auf.
Im Februar 2021 hatte zunächst die Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood davon berichtet, dass Marilyn Manson – bürgerlich: Brian Warner – ihr schwere physische und psychische Gewalt angetan habe, woraufhin sich ihr weitere Ex-Geliebte des Musikers mit ähnlichen Anschuldigungen anschlossen.
Wood war 2006 gerade mal 18-jährig mit dem damals 37-jährigen, verheirateten Manson zusammengekommen, für rund vier Jahre hatten sie eine zwischenzeitlich unterbrochene Beziehung. Darin ist es laut Wood immer wieder zu Misshandlungen durch Manson gekommen, die von aggressivem Geschreie über Schlafentzug bis hin zu Auspeitschungen und Vergewaltigungen reichten.

Der Sänger wies das alles zurück, sprach von einer einvernehmlichen Beziehung. Es gab Anzeigen, Ermittlungen und Klagen gegen ihn, doch verurteilt wurde er bisher nicht. Ein Grund dafür ist die Verjährungsfrist bei häuslicher Gewalt im kalifornischen Recht (das Paar lebte in L.A.).
Die stark traumatisierte Evan Rachel Wood hat lange gebraucht, um überhaupt über ihre Erlebnisse sprechen zu können. Weil ihr die Problematik der Verjährung bewusst war, strengte sie, noch bevor sie Manson als ihren Peiniger benannte, mit einer Unterstützerinnen-Gruppe eine Gesetzesänderung an – das Ziel waren bis zu zehn statt bis zu drei Jahren Verjährungsfrist. Am Ende erreichte sie fünf – zu kurz für die bisher gegen Marilyn Manson vorgebrachten Beschuldigungen.
So endeten verschiedene Zivilklagen erfolglos, mit einem Vergleich oder wurden sogar fallen gelassen. Es sieht derzeit stark danach aus, als würde der Rocksänger juristisch nicht belangt werden. Allerdings hat er seinen Plattenvertrag und sein Management verloren. Inzwischen gibt es weitere belastende Aussagen gegen ihn, etwa seitens eines einstigen Assistenten. Die Karriere von Marilyn Manson wird definitiv nicht so weitergehen wie vor den Aussagen der Frauen. Dasselbe lässt sich schon jetzt über Rammstein sagen.",2023-06-18T17:00:00Z,https://www.tagesspiegel.de,Tagesspiegel
Die Causa Rammstein: Sind Missbrauchsvorwürfe wirklich ein Karrierekiller?,"Gibt es die viel beschworene Cancel Culture wirklich? Anhand von Beispielen wie Luke Mockridge oder Marilyn Manson zeigt sich: Es ist kompliziert.
Es sind schwere Vorwürfe, die seit ein paar Tagen in der Welt sind. Eine Irin wirft dem Rammstein-Sänger Till Lindemann (60) vor, sie und andere Fans während eines Konzerts der Band in der vergangenen Woche unter Drogen gesetzt zu haben. Die 24-Jährige veröffentlichte in den sozialen Medien Fotos von Verletzungen und Chatverläufe mit anderen angeblichen Opfern.
In der Nacht zu Montag reagierte die Band auf die Anschuldigungen, nachdem sich diese via Twitter und Instagram rasant verbreitet hatten. „Zu den im Netz kursierenden Vorwürfen zu Vilnius können wir ausschließen, dass sich was behauptet wird, in unserem Umfeld zugetragen hat. Uns sind keine behördlichen Ermittlungen dazu bekannt“, heißt es in einem Statement auf Rammsteins offiziellem Twitter-Account.
Vielfach ist in den Kommentaren zur Causa Rammstein nun davon die Rede, dass die Band mit den Vorwürfen mundtot gemacht werden solle – ein in diesen Fällen üblicher Reflex. „Der Rammstein ‚Skandal‘ zeigt mir mal wieder wie gefährlich die Cancel Culture ist“, schreibt eine Userin bei Twitter.
Doch ein Blick auf prominente Beispiele aus der jüngsten Vergangenheit zeigt: So einfach ist es beileibe nicht.
Der #Rammstein “Skandal” zeigt mir mal wieder wie gefährlich die Cancel Culture ist.
Es gibt 0 Beweise die 100% irgendwas belegen.
Trotzdem fangen Leute an Schlüsse zu ziehen die sich absolut 0 mit dem Thema befasst haben und die Band zu haten. — Anika❤️‍🔥 (@anikaohnenamen) May 29, 2023
1. Luke Mockridge
Der in Bonn geborene Comedian war zu seinen besten Zeiten regelmäßig zu Gast auf den großen Bühnen und bei den großen Sendern. Er trat im Quatsch Comedy Club auf, bei „TV total“ und im „ZDF-Fernsehgarten“, seit 2015 hatte er eine eigene Sendung bei Sat.1.
2021 erhob seine Ex-Freundin, die Moderatorin Ines Anioli, in den sozialen Medien Vorwürfe sexualisierter Gewalt gegen Mockridge. Im Internet riefen Frauen den Hashtag #KonsequenzenFürLuke ins Leben. Daraufhin zog sich der 34-Jährige von September 2021 bis März 2022 aus der Öffentlichkeit zurück.
Ein auf eine Anzeige Aniolis eingeleitetes Ermittlungsverfahren wurde von der Staatsanwaltschaft Köln eingestellt. Die Staatsanwältin sah damals unter anderem wegen Unstimmigkeiten in den Angaben Aniolis keinen hinreichenden Tatverdacht. Der Spiegel, der unter dem Titel „Die Akte Mockridge“ den Fall noch einmal aufrollte, musste wesentliche Teile des Textes wegen „unzulässiger Verdachtsberichterstattung“ streichen, nachdem Mockridge gerichtlich dagegen vorgegangen war.
Inzwischen steht Mockridge wieder auf der Bühne. Mit seinem neuen Programm „Trippy“ tourt er derzeit durch Deutschland. Auch Sat.1 hat den Komiker und Moderator ins Programm zurückgeholt. Bei seinem TV-Comeback erklärte er Anfang Januar: „Vor einem Jahr hätte ich es nicht gedacht, dass ich noch mal auf einer Bühne stehe. Der Shitstorm, das war schon ein krasses Ding.“ Er habe dabei zuschauen müssen, wie auf einmal seine ganze Welt in Flammen stand. „Das hat mich richtig fertiggemacht.“
Im Studio bekam der Sänger tosenden Applaus, auf Social Media hagelte es Kritik. Proteste gab es auch am Rande eines Berlin-Auftritts von Mockridge in der Mercedes-Benz-Arena. Doch die Auftritte des Comedians sind gefragt: Gerade wurde seine aktuelle Tour bis zum 30. Juni verlängert.
2. Marilyn Manson
Es war die Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood, die vor gut zwei Jahren auf Instagram ein Statement veröffentlichte. Darin beschuldigte sie den Musiker Marilyn Manson, sie mehrere Jahre lang auf multiple Weise missbraucht zu haben. Weitere Frauen schlossen sich noch am selben Tag Woods Anschuldigungen an.
Die Folgen waren zunächst gravierend für den Sänger, der alle Anschuldigungen gegen ihn stets bestritt: Seine Plattenfirma und die Künstleragentur kündigten die Zusammenarbeit mit ihm auf, er wurde aus TV-Serien herausgeschnitten. Es gab ein Ermittlungsverfahren gegen Manson, mehrere Zivilklagen wurden eingeleitet. Eine erste wurde inzwischen wegen Fristversäumnis abgewiesen, die Klägerin erklärte im Nachgang, ihre erhobenen Vorwürfe würden nicht stimmen. Sie habe dem Druck von Wood und anderen Frauen nachgegeben, um Manson zu beschuldigen.
Stand jetzt laufen gegen Manson noch drei Missbrauchsklagen. Derweil werden Gerüchte über ein Comeback des Rockers immer lauter, Manson befeuert sie selbst auf Instagram: Vor zwei Wochen postete er dort nach langer Abwesenheit den bedeutungsschweren Satz „I’ve got something for you to hear“. Ein Hinweis auf neue Musik von ihm?
3. Kevin Spacey
Kevin Spacey legte mit zwei Oscars und seiner Darstellung als machthungriger Politiker Frank Underwood in „House of Cards“ eine Bilderbuchkarriere hin, die nach Vorwürfen sexueller Belästigung vor dem Aus zu stehen schien. Kurz nach Bekanntwerden des Weinstein-Skandals gab ein Schauspielkollege an, er sei 1986 im Alter von 14 Jahren auf einer Party vom damals 26-jährigen, alkoholisierten Spacey sexuell belästigt worden.
Infolge der Vorwürfe trennte sich Spaceys Agentur von ihm, Ende 2017 beendete auch der Streamingdienst Netflix mit sofortiger Wirkung die Zusammenarbeit mit Spacey. Regisseur Ridley Scott schnitt alle Szenen mit dem 63-Jährigen aus seinem damals anstehenden Film heraus. Weitere Männer meldeten sich mit Vorwürfen. Doch in einem ersten Verfahren im Oktober 2022 wurde der Schauspieler in allen Anklagepunkten freigesprochen. Auch von allen weiteren öffentlich bekannten Vorwürfen führte bisher keiner zu einer Verurteilung vor Gericht. Ein Prozess aufgrund von Missbrauchsanschuldigungen steht allerdings noch aus, er soll Ende Juni in London beginnen.

Während Spacey seit Herbst 2017 in keinen großen Produktionen mehr besetzt wird, hat er durchaus weiterhin Arbeit und Fans. Im vergangenen Jahr besetzte der italienische Regisseur Franco Nero ihn in einem Film, was dem Werk einige Aufmerksamkeit einbrachte. In Turin bekam der gefallene Hollywoodstar im Januar einen Preis für sein Lebenswerk – und dankte dem Nationalen Filmmuseum in seiner Rede dafür, „le palle“ („die Eier“) gehabt zu haben, ihn einzuladen. Das Publikum jubelte.
4. Johnny Depp
Jubel nahm auch Johnny Depp kürzlich in Cannes entgegen. In „Jeanne du Barry“, dem Eröffnungsfilm des wichtigsten Filmfestivals der Welt, spielt er Ludwig XV. Die Franzosen rollten dem einstigen Hollywooddarling den roten Teppich aus, bei seinem Eintreffen vor dem Grand Théâtre Lumière wurde der 59-Jährige von begeistert kreischenden Fans in Empfang genommen.
Auch nach der Vorführung des Historiendramas feierte ihn das Publikum mit siebenminütigen Standing Ovations wie einen König. Derartige Begeisterungsstürme hatte der Schauspieler offenbar nicht erwartet. Denn eigentlich gilt der „Pirates of the Caribbean“-Star seit dem Rechtsstreit mit seiner Ex-Frau Amber Heard und den Schlagzeilen um häusliche Gewalt als Persona non grata. Zumindest in Hollywood.
Das heißt aber noch lange nicht, dass seine Karriere vorbei ist. 2022 wurde bekannt, dass sich Depp mit dem Biopic „Modi“ demnächst an seine nächste Regiearbeit machen will. Laut Branchenberichten soll er dafür Hollywoodlegende Al Pacino gewonnen haben.",2023-05-30T12:08:20Z,https://www.berliner-zeitung.de,Berliner Zeitung
Marilyn Manson: Evan Rachel Wood fürchtet sich um ihre Sicherheit,"Es sind schwere Vorwürfe, die Evan Rachel Wood ihrem Ex Marilyn Manson macht. Weil sie sich derart vor seiner Rache fürchtet, ist es für sie sogar okay, dass ihr Sohn bei seinem Vater lebt, damit er vor dem Schockrocker geschützt ist.
1/6 Evan Rachel Wood fürchtet sich vor ihrem Ex, dem Schockrocker Marilyn Manson.
Evan Rachel Wood (35) hat Angst vor Marilyn Mansons (54) Rache. Diese Angst ist so gross, dass sie jetzt sogar ihrem Ex-Lebensgefährten Jamie Bell (37) das Sorgerecht für den gemeinsamen Sohn überlässt. Laut Gerichtsdokumenten, in die die US-Zeitung «The Blast» Einsicht bekam, willigte die Schauspielerin ein, dass Sohn Jack (9) mit seinem Vater in Los Angeles wohnen darf und sie nur noch das Besuchsrecht hat.
Evan Rachel Wood lebt seit zwei Jahren in Nashville (USA) und wollte ihr Kind aus Angst vor ihrem Ex-Freund Manson nicht mehr zu Bell nach Los Angeles lassen. Worauf dieser vor das Familiengericht zog. Dort einigten sich die beiden nun darauf, dass Jack primär bei seinem Vater leben soll und Wood ihn ein langes Wochenende im Monat bekommt. Ebenso wird das Kind in den Ferien bei der Mutter sein. Ein Insider bei «The Blast» enthüllt: «Evan hat dem zugestimmt, weil sie extreme Angst davor hat, dass ihr Kind in ihrer Nähe in Gefahr ist.» In Gerichtsakten im Juli 2022 hatte Wood behauptet, Manson habe ihr gedroht, den damals Achtjährigen sexuell missbrauchen zu wollen – was der Schockrocker dementierte.
Wood lebt in extremer Angst
Wood hatte vor dem Familiengericht von Orange County zu ihrer Angst vor Mansons Rache gesagt: «Ich bin eine Hauptzeugin in einer kriminellen Ermittlung. Ich war das Opfer von Folter, Vergewaltigung und pädophilen Anwandlungen durch eine international bekannte Persönlichkeit.» Der «Westworld»-Star weiter: «Ich lebe in extremer Furcht vor dem mutmasslichen Täter. Ich habe durch ihn traumatische, körperliche und seelische Verletzungen erlitten. Ich befürchte, er wird sich an mir dafür rächen wollen, weil ich gegen ihn aussage – in dem er mich, meinen Sohn und Mitglieder meiner Familie Leid antut.» Wood will von einem Ermittler erfahren haben, dass ihre Sicherheit in Gefahr sei.
Bell hatte vor dem Familiengericht behauptet, dass Wood «meinen Sohn von mir fernhält». In den Gerichtsakten schrieb er: «Welche Ängste Evan hinsichtlich Dritter auch hat, sie sollten keine Auswirkungen auf das Sorgerecht für unseren Sohn haben. Ich will gar nicht daran denken, welchen psychologischen Schaden Jack davontragen wird, weil Evan ihm Angst macht und ihn von mir isoliert.» Das Familiengericht stimmte dem zu, worauf sich Wood und Bell auf die neue Sorgerechtsregelung einigten.

Marilyn Manson Claims Thrown Out in Evan Rachel Wood Lawsuit,"Photo-Illustration: Vulture. Photos: Leon Bennett/WireImage; Stephen Lovekin/Shutterstock
Many of Marilyn Manson’s defamation claims against Evan Rachel Wood have been struck down in the latest legal development around the rock musician. A California judge made a tentative ruling on May 9, dismissing claims including that Wood, the most prominent victim to accuse Manson of abuse, “recruited, coordinated, and pressured” other women to make accusations. Judge Teresa Beaudet made the ruling under the state’s anti-SLAPP statute, which protects individuals — often domestic violence victims — from “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” like defamation claims over their accusations. Wood’s attorney, Michael Kump, celebrated the ruling, telling Pitchfork in a statement that it “affirms and protects Evan’s exercise of her fundamental First Amendment rights.” Meanwhile, an attorney for Manson, born Brian Warner, said he plans to appeal. “The ruling is disappointing but not unexpected,” Howard E. King told Pitchfork.
An appeal would further draw out this legal battle, with Manson’s remaining claims currently set to go to trial on May 1, 2024. Manson’s lawyer said the appeal would specifically focus on evidence that Beaudet previously threw out, including testimony from Ashley Morgan Smithline, a former Manson accuser who later recanted her claims and said Wood and her Phoenix Rising collaborator Illma Gore pressured her. The judge ruled that Gore’s messages to women about the documentary — in which Gore said there was “no pressure to be involved in any way” — were “not ‘so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.’”",2023-05-10T16:50:01Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
Marilyn Manson Has Multiple Defamation Claims Against Evan Rachel Wood Thrown Out by Judge,"Marilyn Manson faced a setback in court today in his ongoing defamation case against Evan Rachel Wood. Judge Teresa Beaudet threw out some of Manson’s claims from his original lawsuit, including his assertion that Wood “recruited, coordinated, and pressured” women to make false statements about him and another alleging that Wood forged an FBI letter.
In a statement, Manson’s attorney said they plan to appeal. A tentative trial date is set for May 1, 2024, though the appeal from Manson will likely push that date back. Several claims remain pending against Wood.
“We are very pleased with the Court’s ruling, which affirms and protects Evan’s exercise of her fundamental First Amendment rights,” Michael Kump, attorney for Evan Rachel Wood, said in a statement. “As the Court correctly found, Plaintiff failed to show that his claims against her have even minimal merit.”
“The ruling is disappointing but not unexpected,” Manson’s attorney Howard King said in a statement. “The Court telegraphed this outcome when it refused to consider the bombshell sworn declaration of former plaintiff Ashley Smithline, which detailed how women were systematically pressured by Evan Rachel Wood and Illma Gore to make false claims about Brian Warner.” King continued:
“The failure to admit this critical evidence, along with the Court’s decision to not consider Ms. Gore’s iPad, the contents of which demonstrated how she and Ms. Wood crafted a forged FBI letter, will be the subject of an immediate appeal to the California Court of Appeal.”
In the original lawsuit, Manson claimed that Wood and Gore “secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner” and “provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner.”
Manson submitted declarations from two women, who both claimed that Gore reached out with the note that they weren’t “obligated to speak” at a meeting and that there was “no pressure to be involved in any way.” Judge Beaudet wrote that the messages from Gore were “not ‘so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.’” She also dismissed checklist images found on an iPad formerly owned by Gore stating “name,” “contact,” and “willing to testify.” Beaudet argues that the images don’t demonstrate intent to pressure anyone into making false accusations.
Regarding the allegedly forged FBI letter, Judge Beaudet points to Wood’s argument that she never published the letter—it surfaced in a California custody proceeding. “A forged letter, if it never saw the light of day, could not cause emotional distress, nor be intended to do so,” Wood’s argument reads. “Any alleged distress could only be caused (and intended) through the letter’s publication.” Beaudet concurs that Manson’s team doesn’t cite other instances where the letter was published.
Judge Beaudet also determined that Wood and Ilma Gore’s comments about Manson’s 1996 short film Groupie constituted “protected activity.” Manson also referred to Gore’s “false and defamatory statements” regarding Groupie, saying she falsely identified the actress in the film as a minor and referred to it as child pornography. Judge Beaudet agreed with Gore’s claim that protecting people from sex offenders is a matter of public interest.",2023-05-10T01:03:35Z,https://pitchfork.com,Pitchfork
LA Judge Guts Marilyn Manson Lawsuit Against Ex Evan Rachel Wood,"A California judge on Tuesday threw out key sections of Marilyn Manson's lawsuit against his former fiancée, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, claiming she fabricated public allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship and encouraged other women to do the same.
Manson's suit, filed last year, alleges that Wood and another woman named as a defendant, Illma Gore, defamed Manson, intentionally caused him emotional distress and derailed his career in music, TV and film. It says they used false pretenses, including a phony letter from the FBI, to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say about Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Teresa A. Beaudet dismissed the part of the suit dealing with the disputed FBI letter, which Wood denies forging. Beaudet also tossed out a section that alleges Wood and Gore used a checklist found on an iPad for other women to use to make abuse claims about Manson.
The judge did not rule on the merits of the FBI letter, but found that the evidence that the defendants used it to recruit other women and harm Manson was hypothetical and thin. Evidence was also lacking that Wood and Gore created the checklist, Beaudet found. She said the probability of Manson prevailing on either part was low.

Beaudet’s ruling relied on California law meant to protect the free speech of defendants from being squelched by lawsuits.
“We are very pleased with the Court’s ruling, which affirms and protects Evan’s exercise of her fundamental First Amendment rights,” Wood’s attorney Michael Kump said in a statement. “As the Court correctly found, Plaintiff failed to show that his claims against her have even minimal merit.”
Manson's attorney said he plans an immediate appeal.
“The ruling is disappointing but not unexpected,” Manson’s attorney Howard King said in an email. “The Court telegraphed this outcome when it refused to consider the bombshell sworn declaration of former plaintiff Ashley Smithline, which detailed how women were systematically pressured by Evan Rachel Wood and Illma Gore to make false claims about Brian Warner.”
The judge overruled Wood's motion to dismiss other parts of the lawsuit alleging the defendants intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Manson. The remaining sections include allegations the women hacked Manson’s email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was emailing illegal pornography, and “swatted” him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home.
Several women have sued Manson in recent years with allegations of sexual and other abuse. Most have been dismissed or settled, including a suit filed by “Game of Thrones” actor Esme Bianco.
And police and prosecutors have been conducting a criminal investigation of Manson for more than two years. In September, prosecutors said they needed more evidence from detectives before deciding whether to charge him. The women involved have not been identified.
The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly.
In 2017, when the #MeToo movement gained momentum, Wood said she had been raped and abused, and she gave testimony to a Congressional committee in 2018, both without naming anyone. Then in an Instagram post in February of 2020, Wood named Manson, saying he “horrifically abused me for years.” The two revealed they were a couple in 2007, and were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up. An HBO documentary on the allegations premiered in March.
Manson's lawsuit says Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship, and she said nothing of his abusing her for 10 years until she met Gore, an artist whom the lawsuit describes as Wood’s on-again, off-again romantic partner.",2023-05-09T23:06:16Z,https://www.nbcboston.com,NBC10 Boston
Marilyn Manson Loses Again In Court Battle With Evan Rachel Wood,"Shock rocker Marilyn Manson just got a legal shock as a California judge tossed out most of the fading musician’s defamation case against Evan Rachel Wood over the Westworld actress’ claims of abuse during the former couple’s relationship.
“The Court grants Wood’s special motion to strike in part,” wrote , LA Superior Court Judge Teresa A. Beaudet Tuesday in a multi-pronged tentative order that has just become final (read it here).
Emphasizing the Golden State’s anti-SLAPP statute and its protect of individual free speech, Judge Beaudet took a lot of the guts out of Manson a.k.a. Brian Warner’s suit of March 2022. While Manson’s case can proceed on the remaining counts, the big-ticket items are pretty much dead, at least for now. Among the claims now out of the suit are Manson and his lawyers attempts to taint Wood with penning a fictitious FBI letter and preparing a checklist of sorts for alleged Manson victims to draw from.
“We are very pleased with the Court’s ruling, which affirms and protects Evan’s exercise of her fundamental First Amendment rights,” Wood’s lead attorney Michael Kump told Deadline after the order out of a hearing today was finalized. “As the Court correctly found, Plaintiff failed to show that his claims against her have even minimal merit.”
Suffering a second successive loss in the case, Manson’s team had their own take on the judge’s decision, and how they aim to take another swing.
“The ruling is disappointing but not unexpected. The Court telegraphed this outcome when it refused to consider the bombshell sworn declaration of former plaintiff Ashley Smithline, which detailed how women were systematically pressured by Evan Rachel Wood and Illma Gore to make false claims about Brian Warner,” declared Manson lawyer Howard King this afternoon.
“The failure to admit this critical evidence, along with the Court’s decision to not consider Ms. Gore’s iPad, the contents of which demonstrated how she and Ms. Wood crafted a forged FBI letter, will be the subject of an immediate appeal to the California Court of Appeal,” he added.
Manson’s suit came a year after Wood herself took to social media in 2021 to publicly named her ex-fiancée for a pattern of “horrifically” abusing and “grooming” her during the duo’s 2007 to 2010 relationship. The now 35-year-old Wood was 16 when she and Manson became a couple. In 2017, Wood told a Congressional committee that she had been raped and repeatedly abused but did not actually give a name of who the alleged predator was.
Dropped by his record label and losing TV gigs and CAA representation in short order after Wood named Manson, the singer said the claims were “horrible distortions of reality.” In the following weeks and months number of others, like Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco came forward with allegations and lawsuits of their own detailing physical and psychological abuse by Manson.
A number of cases and claims against Manson have been settled, dismissed, as was the true of Smithline’s efforts, or dropped in the past year or so. For instance, Bianco ceased her nearly two-year long sexual assault and sexual battery case against Manson in February 2022 after the parties reached a confidential settlement.
At the core of Manson’s now mainly neutered suit against Wood is Phoenix Rising. The two-part documentary on the singer and his supposed cycles of abuse and violence premiered at the virtual 2022 Sundance Film Festival. A couple months later, the Amy Berg film debuted on HBO – even after Manson tried to move legal Heaven and Earth to stop it
In February 2021, the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department’s Special Victims Bureau opened a probe into multiple abuse allegations that occurred between 2009-2011, when Manson lived in West Hollywood. A portion of that investigation was submitted to LA County D.A. George Gascón.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Teresa A. Beaudet dismissed the part of the suit dealing with the disputed FBI letter, which Wood denies forging. Beaudet also tossed out a section that alleges Wood and Gore used a checklist found on an iPad for other women to use to make abuse claims about Manson.
The judge did not rule on the merits of the FBI letter, but found that the evidence that the defendants used it to recruit other women and harm Manson was hypothetical and thin. Evidence was also lacking that Wood and Gore created the checklist, Beaudet found. She said the probability of Manson prevailing on either part was low.
Beaudet’s ruling relied on California law meant to protect the free speech of defendants from being squelched by lawsuits.
“We are very pleased with the Court’s ruling, which affirms and protects Evan’s exercise of her fundamental First Amendment rights,” Wood’s attorney Michael Kump said in a statement. “As the Court correctly found, Plaintiff failed to show that his claims against her have even minimal merit.”
Manson’s attorney said he plans an immediate appeal.
“The ruling is disappointing but not unexpected,” Manson’s attorney Howard King said in an email. “The Court telegraphed this outcome when it refused to consider the bombshell sworn declaration of former plaintiff Ashley Smithline, which detailed how women were systematically pressured by Evan Rachel Wood and Illma Gore to make false claims about Brian Warner.”
The judge overruled Wood’s motion to dismiss other parts of the lawsuit alleging the defendants intentionally inflicted emotional distress on Manson. The remaining sections include allegations the women hacked Manson’s email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was emailing illegal pornography, and “swatted” him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home.
Several women have sued Manson in recent years with allegations of sexual and other abuse. Most have been dismissed or settled, including a suit filed by “Game of Thrones” actor Esme Bianco.
And police and prosecutors have been conducting a criminal investigation of Manson for more than two years. In September, prosecutors said they needed more evidence from detectives before deciding whether to charge him. The women involved have not been identified.
The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly.
In 2017, when the #MeToo movement gained momentum, Wood said she had been raped and abused, and she gave testimony to a Congressional committee in 2018, both without naming anyone. Then in an Instagram post in February of 2020, Wood named Manson, saying he “horrifically abused me for years.” The two revealed they were a couple in 2007, and were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up. An HBO documentary on the allegations premiered in March.
Manson’s lawsuit says Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship, and she said nothing of his abusing her for 10 years until she met Gore, an artist whom the lawsuit describes as Wood’s on-again, off-again romantic partner.

‘Cool time to be making shit’: why artist Illma Gore is optimistic about the rise of AI,"The seemingly sudden emergence of artificial intelligence into our everyday reality has unsettled many – but not Illma Gore.
“We are entering a new era,” she says. “What an exciting time to be an artist. What a cool time to be making shit.”
The Brisbane and LA-based artist is known for her provocations and is no stranger to controversy, from tattooing the names of thousands of strangers on to her body, to being sued by Marilyn Manson for her role in documenting claims of his sexual abuse, to painting Donald Trump having a very small penis.
But the work she will create for the Brisbane street art festival is, on its surface at least, far more bucolic than all that.
In Artistic Visions of a Brighter Future a small boy sits among grass and wildflowers, his bare feet dangling above a stream as he pencils his homework into a bound paper book. Dappled in warm yellow sunlight beside the boy is a dog – of a sort.

This is no flesh and blood canine but Boston Dynamics’ Spot, described in one Washington Post headline as “the $74,500 robot dog of our dystopian dreams”.
But Gore is bored of a dystopia dreamed up by artists like Mike Winkelmann, or Beeple, whose work features dismembered human body parts branded with serial numbers and attached to electronic machinery and giant robotic avatars of tech billionaires being worshipped like deities.
Gore gets that people are scared.
“We have so many issues with climate and capitalism, the American government and the two-party system is absolutely fucked, everyone’s angry,” she says.
Though born and raised in Brisbane – her developer father, Mike Gore, was one of Joh Bjelke-Petersen’s infamous “white-shoe brigade” – Gore’s mother was from the US and the artist moved to California at the age of 20.
She has more first-hand experience of the anger and dysfunction circulating in the US than most Australians.
After her infamous nude Trump portrait she was suspended from Facebook, hounded with death threats – even physically attacked.
Gore recently returned to her home city – a place she says has “grown so much creatively the last 10 years” – for a break from the US, describing the moment her plane touched down as a “huge relief”.
“America is like a third-world country driving a Porsche,” Gore says. “It’s quite intense at the moment.”
It’s not just legislatively that we, as a society, are lagging the rapid advance of technology, Gore believes, but emotionally.
Which explains why, as an artist, Gore is excited.
“Imagine looking back at the 21st century in history and being like: ‘this is right before we had AI and robots fully integrated into society, what art were they making?’,” she says.
For a decidedly contemporary artist, Gore is acutely aware of their place in history. And she believes we’ve been here before.

What were the fireside discussions when the wheel was invented, Gore asks – “kids these days and their wheels, they got it so easy”.
And just as Andy Warhol’s soup cans came to visually define the era of US mass production, Gore can’t help but wonder what the great thinkers, writers and creators of the past would have made of the rapidly emerging future in which we find ourselves.
What would Diogenes the Cynic, who so scorned the superficiality of his fellow Athenians that he dressed in rags and lived in a barrel in the agora, what would Diogenes have thought of the selfie generation and how would he have performed his ripostes?
What would Mary Cassatt and Frida Kahlo have made of the evolution of femininity?
Things can be bad and good at the same time, says Gore. Photograph: Dan Peled/The Guardian
What timeless phrases could Shakespeare have conjured with lol, rizz and our endless stream of slang and buzzwords?
Gore’s far from alone in grappling with the emotional significance of this moment in history – she’s not even the first artist to play with a Boston Dynamics’ robotic dog.
Art and marketing collective MSCHF bought themselves a Spot and mounted a paintball gun on it, in what Gore describes as a valid conversation around the militarisation of robotics.
But far fewer are those committed to imagining a future with robotics and artificial intelligence that “all just works”.
Because Gore, a techno-optimist like Agnieszka Pilat – who trained Boston Dynamics’ dogs in the art of portraiture – believes things can be bad and still be getting better at the same time.
“There will be new jobs, there will be new stuff to do,” she says.
Is Gore being naive? That is a question that, for now, not even artificial intelligence can answer.
“I am an AI language model and do not have the ability to interpret the behaviour or state of mind of individuals,” was ChatGPT’s response.
But then, if the program was intent upon world domination, it would say that, wouldn’t it?
Gore’s is one of nine temporary artworks being installed in the Queen Street Mall for the street art festival which also includes permanent works being put up on walls around the city.",2023-04-29T20:00:45Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
"Journey Band Members Feud, YNW Melly Death Penalty Appeal & More","This is The Legal Beat, a weekly newsletter about music law from Billboard Pro, offering you a one-stop cheat sheet of big new cases, important rulings and all the fun stuff in between.
This week: A deep-dive into the messy – and litigious – situation inside the iconic 80s rock band Journey; an update on YNW Melly’s death-penalty case at the Florida Supreme Court; a sudden dismissal of a copyright lawsuit against Benny Blanco, Ed Sheeran and others; and much more.

THE BIG STORY: Don’t Stop Litigatin’
If you read one thing this week, make it Steve Knopper’s long Billboard story about the simmering problems inside Journey — an epic tale of internal dysfunction among members of an iconic band that’s still printing money decades after its “Don’t Stop Believing” heyday.
The story has it all: dueling security guards in green rooms; a multi-million-dollar pay-per-view wedding; a trail of fired managers and staffers; and an absolute all-timer quote: “This is Neal. I am fucking your wife.” But above all else, it has lawsuits — ranging from divorce to defamation to intellectual property to assault.
Sure, there’s the current battle between lead guitarist Neal Schon and keyboardist Jonathan Cain over a disputed American Express card. But there’s also the lawsuit filed against Live Nation over an alleged assault on Schon’s wife, a case alleging a “coup” by former bandmates Steve Smith and bassist Ross Valory, a trademark dispute with former frontman Steve Perry and much more.
For the full breakdown of the crisis inside Journey, go read the entire story here.
Other top stories this week…
DEATH PENALTY DISPUTE – Prosecutors urged the Florida Supreme Court to reject an appeal by YNW Melly from a ruling last year that said he could face the death penalty if convicted at an upcoming murder trial. The rapper says the state forfeited the right to seek the death penalty by failing to give proper notice, but prosecutors say he “suffered no harm.”
MARILYN MANSON UPDATE – A week after one of Marilyn Manson’s sexual assault accusers recanted her allegations, a judge ruled that the sudden reversal couldn’t be used as evidence in Manson’s defamation lawsuit against his ex-fiance Evan Rachel Wood. The move came after Wood’s lawyers argued the “eleventh hour” revelation was just a “bad-faith” effort to save Manson’s case.
COPYRIGHT CASE CLOSED – Two songwriters who sued Benny Blanco, Halsey, Khalid and Ed Sheeran for copyright infringement over their 2018 hit “Eastside” suddenly dropped the lawsuit. The accusers told Billboard that they decided that continuing the case would have been “too costly, challenging, and risky for us”; but Blanco’s lawyer said the accusations were “baseless” and “never should have been made” in the first place.
PODCAST POT CLASH – Chris “Kit” Gray, the president and co-founder of PodcastOne, was hit with a lawsuit claiming he fired his executive assistant because she refused to ship cannabis products from California (where they’re legal) to his home in Florida (where they aren’t).
TRAVIS SCOTT’S NIGHTCLUB SCUFFLE – Police in New York sought to question rapper Travis Scott after he was accused of assaulting a sound engineer and causing $12,000 worth of damage to sound equipment at Manhattan nightclub Nebula. His reps called it “a misunderstanding being blown out of proportion” and stressed that no charges had been filed. Scott is expected to sit for questioning this week.",2023-03-07T21:56:52Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Manson Accuser’s Reversal Can’t Be Used Against Evan Rachel Wood: Judge,"A Los Angeles judge ruled Tuesday (Feb. 28) that Marilyn Manson‘s lawyers could not cite a recent bombshell recantation by Ashley Morgan Smithline, one of his former abuse accusers, in his ongoing defamation lawsuit against actress Evan Rachel Wood.
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
Last week, Smithline claimed in a court filing she had “succumbed to pressure” from Wood to make “untrue” accusations against Manson. The singer’s lawyers wanted to use that as evidence in their lawsuit against Wood, who they allege orchestrated an “organized attack” of false rape accusations against her ex-fiance Manson.
But Wood quickly fired back that she “never pressured or manipulated” Smithline. And her lawyers asked the judge to ignore the new filing, arguing that the “eleventh hour” reversal by Smithline was just a “bad-faith” effort to save Manson’s case from being dismissed.
In an order issued Tuesday obtained by Billboard, Judge Teresa A. Beaudet sided with Wood’s lawyers, refusing to allow Smithline’s statements to be admitted into the case record for now because they had been filed too late.
That means the judge won’t view those statements as evidence at a hearing next month over whether to dismiss Manson’s case or allow it to proceed toward trial. The ruling leaves open the possibility that the statement could be admitted if the case survives.
An attorney for Manson declined to comment. A rep for Wood did not return a request for comment.
Smithline and Wood are two of several women to accuse Manson of serious sexual wrongdoing over the past two years. After the Westworld star posted her allegations to Instagram in February 2021, lawsuits quickly followed from Smithline, Manson’s former assistant Ashley Walters, Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco and a Jane Doe accuser. Another Jane Doe case was filed last month.
Manson has denied all of the allegations, and the cases by Smithline, Walters and Bianco have since been dropped, dismissed or settled. Now, the rocker is pursuing his own defamation lawsuit, claiming that Wood and another woman, Illma Gore, had “secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously” with false accusations against him.
Last week, Smithline made her bombshell accusations about being “manipulated” by Wood in a sworn declaration submitted by Manson’s attorneys in the defamation case, stating: “I succumbed to pressure from Evan Rachel Wood and her associates to make accusations of rape and assault against Mr. Warner that were not true.”
The new claims came as Wood’s attorneys were seeking to dismiss Manson’s case by citing California’s so-called anti-SLAPP statute — a law that aims to make it easier to dismiss cases that threaten free speech. Wood’s lawyers say Manson’s case is exactly that: an effort to punish the actress after she chose to speak publicly about years of alleged abuse by a prominent musician.
“For years, plaintiff Brian Warner raped and tortured defendant Evan Rachel Wood and threatened retaliation if she told anyone about it,” her attorneys wrote. “Warner has now made good on those threats by filing the present lawsuit.”
Manson’s attorneys wanted to cite Smithline’s recantation as a reason for Beaudet to deny the anti-SLAPP motion. They argued that it was early proof that they could eventually win their case against Wood, meaning it was a legitimate lawsuit and not merely an effort to stifle her free speech.
But Wood’s lawyers said the window to file such evidence had closed more than three months prior and must be denied: “Plaintiff’s ex parte application is a bad-faith attempt to save his meritless SLAPP claim from dismissal by requesting leave to file an untimely declaration, containing provable falsehoods, made under unreliable circumstances.”
At a hearing Tuesday, the judge denied the request to admit Smithline’s declaration. As reported by Rolling Stone, the judge said at the live hearing that there “really is no explanation as to why this [declaration] is bubbling up at this time.”
A hearing is set for April 11 to consider Wood’s request to dismiss the case under the anti-SLAPP law.",2023-03-01T17:18:24Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Evan Rachel Wood denies pressuring woman into assault claims against Marilyn Manson,"US actor Evan Rachel Wood has denied pressuring a woman into making sexual assault allegations against rock star Marilyn Manson.
In February 2021, Wood and four other women claimed that Manson, real name Brian Warner, had subjected them to various forms of abuse: sexual, physical and emotional, including attacks characterised as torture.
Last week one of those women, Ashley Morgan Smithline – whose subsequent lawsuit against Manson was dismissed by a California court in January – recanted her allegations, claiming that she had “succumbed to pressure from Evan Rachel Wood and her associates to make accusations of rape and assault against Mr Warner that were not true”.
Wood has denied Smithline’s allegations, saying in her own court filing that Smithline initially contacted her, adding: “I never pressured or manipulated Ashley Morgan Smithline to make any accusations against plaintiff Brian Warner, and I certainly never pressured or manipulated her to make accusations that were not true.” Wood included Instagram messages between her and Smithline, and a voicemail message reportedly from Smithline telling a friend that she believed Manson’s legal team wanted her to “turn on the other girls and say it was all a ruse”. Lawyers for Wood also claim Manson’s lawyers pressured and harassed Smithline following her initial lawsuit filing.
Smithline, meanwhile, told Rolling Stone after Wood’s court filing this week: “Evan’s full of shit … she’s saying anything she can to discredit me.”
Manson has always denied any wrongdoing, and is currently suing Wood and her partner Illma Gore for defamation. A judge has denied his request to have Smithline’s recantation included as evidence in that case.
In January, Manson settled out of court with actor Esmé Bianco, who had accused him of rape and sexual battery. Bianco’s representatives said she had agreed to the settlement, whose terms were not disclosed, “in order to move on with her life and career”.
Later that month, Manson faced a fresh lawsuit from an unnamed plaintiff, who alleges that he sexually assaulted her in 1995 when she was 16, and again across the space of a month when she was 19. Manson has not yet commented on that lawsuit.",2023-03-01T11:49:55Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian

THE BIG STORY: Lady Gaga Sued Over Dog Theft Reward
A woman named Jennifer McBride says she deserves a huge reward for returning Lady Gaga’s bulldogs after they were stolen at gunpoint – even though she was also convicted of a criminal charge in connection with the high-profile dognapping.
In a lawsuit filed last week in Los Angeles, McBride demanded that Gaga hand over a $500,000 reward she offered for the safe return of the dogs after the violent 2021 incident. It was McBride, after all, who delivered the dogs to the Los Angeles Police Department two days after Gaga’s dog walker Ryan Fischer was shot and nearly killed.
But there’s one small detail McBride’s lawyers left out of the complaint: In December, she pleaded no contest to receiving stolen property in connection with the dognapping, receiving a sentence of two years of probation.
McBride’s lawyers say it doesn’t matter: That Gaga made a binding “unilateral” offer to pay the reward in return for the safe return of the dogs with “no questions asked” — and McBride took her up on the proposal when she did so. Whether that argument will fly before a judge remains to be seen.
For a full breakdown of McBride’s case — including her full complaint and her arguments that she “fully performed her obligation” to Gaga — go read our entire story here.

ADAM LEVINE’S FAKE MASERATI – Attorneys for Adam Levine filed a lawsuit claiming that a classic car dealer defrauded him by selling him a fake version of an uber-rare Maserati worth a whopping $850,000. The star’s attorneys say the seller took “active steps” to conceal red flags about the car, like phony stamped markings on its chassis.
MARILYN MANSON ACCUSER RECANTS – Ashley Morgan Smithline, a woman who previously sued Marilyn Manson for sexual assault, filed an explosive new document stating that her allegations against the rocker were untrue. Instead, Smithline claimed she had been “manipulated” by Manson’s ex-girlfriend, Evan Rachel Wood. A rep for Wood strongly denied the allegations.
ARREST WARRANT FOR KODAK BLACK – A Florida judge issued an arrest warrant for Kodak Black for failing a drug test while on bail for a drug charge. The rapper, facing trial over an oxycodone trafficking charge, allegedly failed to appear for a scheduled drug test in February and then days later submitted a sample that tested positive for fentanyl.
PRE-TRIAL SHOWDOWN OVER SHEERAN TAPE – Lawyers for Ed Sheeran’s copyright accusers fired back at the star’s efforts to ban an infamous YouTube clip from an upcoming trial over whether “Thinking Out Loud” infringed Marvin Gaye‘s “Let’s Get It On,” calling the video “among the most important and critical evidence in this case.”
NIPSEY HUSSLE KILLER GETS 60+ YEARS – A Los Angeles judge sentenced Eric Ronald Holder Jr. to at least 60 years in prison for gunning down rapper Nipsey Hussle. Holder was convicted in July of premeditated murder over the March 2019 shooting at a Los Angeles strip mall.
LIL PEEP WRONGFUL DEATH CASE SETTLED – The mother of late rapper Lil Peep reached a settlement in her wrongful death lawsuit against her son’s former label and management company, First Access Entertainment (FAE). The lawsuit claimed that Peep’s management team provided him with drugs and kept pushing him to perform even though he was “barely able to communicate.” Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
ACCUSER SAYS NICK CARTER AIMS TO “SILENCE” HER – Shannon “Shay” Ruth, a woman suing Nick Carter over accusations that he raped her in 2001, blasted the Backstreet Boys member for filing a defamation countersuit against her. In a so-called anti-SLAPP motion, Ruth said Carter’s countersuit had “no other purpose than to harass, intimate, and potentially silence plaintiff.”
FESTIVAL ORGANIZERS GO TO PRISON – Aaron McCreight and Doug Hargrave, two former Iowa tourism executives, were each sentenced to more than a year in prison after pleading guilty to bank fraud charges related to Newbo Evolve, a failed 2018 music festival headlined by Maroon 5 and Kelly Clarkson. The pair admitted to lying to a Cedar Rapids bank about projected ticket sales to secure more funding, even as the event appeared headed toward big losses.
BRONX RAPPER CHARGED WITH MURDER – Bronx drill rapper Kay Flock was charged by federal prosecutors with murder and racketeering along with seven other members of two Bronx street gangs, stemming from seven shootings in New York between June 2020 and February 2022. Flock faces a “mandatory life in prison or death” if convicted.
KELLY AVOIDS LENGTHY ADD-ON SENTENCE – A federal judge in Chicago sentenced R. Kelly to 20 years in prison for his convictions of child pornography and the enticement of minors for sex, but said the singer would serve all but one year simultaneously with an earlier 30-year sentence imposed last year on separate racketeering charges.

"Marilyn Manson: Μηνύτρια αποσύρει τις καταγγελίες για κακοποίηση - ""Χειραγωγήθηκα από την Evan Rachel Wood""","Ισχυρίζεται ότι την πίεσε η ηθοποιός και άλλες καταγγέλλουσες και κινηθεί σε βάρος του
Ένα μήνα μετά την απόρριψη της αγωγής της κατά του Marilyn Manson, το μοντέλο Ashley Morgan Smithline κατέθεσε ένορκη δήλωση με την οποία ανακαλεί τους ισχυρισμούς της για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση από τον μουσικό. Ισχυρίζεται ότι «χειραγωγήθηκε» ώστε να τον κατηγορήσει για ψυχολογική, σεξουαλική και σωματική επίθεση.
Η Smithline κατέθεσε δήλωση στο Ανώτατο Δικαστήριο του Λος Άντζελες την Πέμπτη λέγοντας ότι πιέστηκε από την ηθοποιό Evan Rachel Wood κι άλλους να δημοσιοποιήσει τις κατηγορίες που, τώρα, λέει ότι είναι «ψευδείς».
«Υπέκυψα στις πιέσεις της Evan Rachel Wood και των συνεργατών της για να προβώ σε κατηγορίες βιασμού και επίθεσης εναντίον του [Manson] που δεν ήταν αληθινές» ανέφερε στη δήλωση.
Το μοντέλο ισχυρίστηκε ότι «χειραγωγήθηκε επανειλημμένα» από τη Wood κι άλλους - μεταξύ των οποίων η Ashley Walters, πρώην βοηθός του Manson που τον μήνυσε για σεξουαλική επίθεση και σωματική βλάβη το 2021, η φίλη της Wood, Illma Gore, και η ηθοποιός του Game of Thrones, Esmé Bianco - ώστε να πιστέψει ότι είχε κακοποιηθεί με τρόπους παρόμοιους με εκείνους που φέρεται να είχαν κακοποιηθεί κι εκείνες. Ο Manson έχει καταθέσει αγωγή κατά της Wood για συκοφαντική δυσφήμιση.
Διαψεύδει η Evan Rachel Wood
ΔΕΙΤΕ ΑΚΟΜΑ ΔΙΕΘΝΗ Marilyn Manson: Νέα μήνυση εναντίον του για σεξουαλική επίθεση σε ανήλικη
«Η Evan δεν πίεσε ποτέ την Ashley ούτε τη χειραγώγησε. Η Ashley ήταν εκείνη που επικοινώνησε πρώτη με την Evan για την κακοποίηση που είχε υποστεί» αναφέρεται στην ανακοίνωση που εξέδωσε εκπρόσωπος της ηθοποιού και έκρινε πως άλλαξε τη στάση της μετά από τις πιέσεις και απειλές που δέχθηκε μετά την κατάθεση της αγωγής.
Η ιστορία της Smithline, πλέον, είναι ότι είχε μια «σύντομη, συναινετική σεξουαλική σχέση» με τον Manson το 2010 και 10 χρόνια αργότερα επικοινώνησαν μαζί της είτε η Gore, είτε η Walters, ώστε να συμμετάσχει σε συζήτηση μεταξύ όσων είχαν «σχέση ή εμπειρίες» με τον μουσικό.
«Θυμάμαι ότι η Wood με ρώτησε αν με είχαν, μεταξύ άλλων, μαστιγώσει, αλυσοδέσει, δέσει, χαράξει, επιτεθεί ενώ κοιμόμουν, χτυπήσει ή βιάσει. Είπε ότι όλα αυτά τα πράγματα συνέβησαν στην ίδια και σε άλλους και κάθε στιγμή μαζί του ήταν στιγμής επιβίωσης» σημείωσε η Smithline. «Όταν είπα, όχι, αυτό δεν μου συνέβη και δεν ήταν αυτή η εμπειρία μου, θυμάμαι να μου λέει η κα Wood ότι επειδή δεν μπορούσα να θυμηθώ δεν σημαίνει απαραίτητα ότι δεν συνέβη».
Μετά από αυτή τη συνομιλία, όπως ανέφερε, άρχισε να αναρωτιέται εάν την είχε κακοποιήσει το τέως σύντροφός της και απλώς «καταπιέζει» τις μνήμες της.
«Τελικά, άρχισα να πιστεύω ότι αυτό που μου έλεγαν, επανειλημμένα, ότι συνέβη στην κα Wood και στην κα Bianco συνέβη και σε μένα».
Τον Ιανουάριο του 2021, οι άλλες γυναίκες την ενθάρρυναν να μιλήσει δημοσίως κατά του Manson και έναν μήνα αργότερα έκανε σχετική ανάρτηση στο Instagram, είπε. Πλέον διαψεύδει το περιεχόμενο αυτής της ανάρτησης.
Η Smithline δήλωσε πως ότι ο Manson ποτέ δεν σημάδεψε ή χάραξε το σώμα της, όπως ισχυριζόταν προηγουμένως, ούτε και την κακοποίησε. Το μοντέλο σημείωσε ότι «δεν είχε ποτέ την πρόθεση να ασκήσει ποινική δίωξη» κατά του Manson.
Ο μουσικός, σημειώνεται, έχει επανειλημμένα αρνηθεί τους ισχυρισμούς της Smithline και δήλωσε πως η σχέση τους ήταν συναινετική.

Marilyn Manson: Model zieht Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen ihn zurück,"Ashley Smithline, die den Musiker des sexuellen Missbrauchs beschuldigt hatte, behauptet nun, sie sei von anderen Frauen manipuliert worden.
Das Model Ashley Smithline war die vierte Frau, die im Juni 2021 Klage gegen Marilyn Manson einreichte. Damals sagte sie, sie habe psychischen, sexuellen und körperlichen Missbrauch erlitten in der Zeit, als sie mit dem US-Musiker zusammen war. In ihrer Klage behauptete Smithline, Manson habe sie vergewaltigt, sexuell missbraucht, geschnitten und ausgepeitscht und sie auch „gebrandmarkt“, indem er seine Initialen in ihr Bein geschnitzt habe.
Diese Klage wurde kürzlich von einem Richter abgewiesen, nachdem das Model sich nach dem Weggang ihres Anwalts weder dafür entschieden hatte, sich selbst zu vertreten, noch einen neuen Anwalt einstellte. Sie hätte ihren Anspruch erneut geltend machen können, doch Smithline wählte einen anderen Weg.
Nun behauptet sie in einer eidesstattlichen Erklärung, die sie am Donnerstag beim Los Angeles Superior Court eingereicht hat und die auch dem Magazin People vorliegt, sie sei „manipuliert“ worden, um den Rocker des psychischen, sexuellen und körperlichen Missbrauchs zu beschuldigen.
Smithline führt aus, sie sei von der Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood und anderen unter Druck gesetzt worden, mit den Anschuldigungen, die sie jetzt für „falsch“ hält, an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen. „Ich habe dem Druck von Evan Rachel Wood und ihren Mitarbeitern nachgegeben, Anschuldigungen wegen Vergewaltigung und Körperverletzung gegen [Manson] zu erheben, die nicht der Wahrheit entsprechen“, schreibt sie in der Erklärung, aus der die US-Zeitschrift zitiert. Ein Vertreter von Wood bestritt diese Darstellung gegenüber People.

Smithline sagt in ihrer neuen Erklärung, dass sie 2010 eine „kurze, einvernehmliche sexuelle Beziehung“ mit Manson hatte. Zehn Jahre später sei sie für ein Treffen von mehreren Frauen kontaktiert worden. Irgendwann habe sie angefangen zu glauben, dass das, was Evan Rachel Wood und Esmé Bianco passiert sei, auch ihr passiert sei.
Marilyn Manson hat die Anschuldigungen gegen ihn stets bestritten
Manson selbst hatte die ursprünglichen Anschuldigungen von Smithline wiederholt zurückgewiesen und erklärt, dass ihre Beziehung – ebenso wie seine Beziehungen zu weiteren Anklägerinnen – einvernehmlich gewesen sei. „Ich habe niemals eine dieser Frauen missbraucht, angegriffen, vergewaltigt, bedroht oder gehandelt, wie sie behaupten“, wird er in Gerichtsdokumenten zitiert.
Evan Rachel Wood und Esmé Bianco waren die prominentesten Stimmen im Fall Marilyn Manson. Der Fall kam ins Rollen, nachdem Wood im Februar 2021 ein Statement auf Instagram veröffentlicht hatte, in dem sie angab, von dem Musiker mehrere Jahre auf multiple Weise missbraucht worden zu sein. Weitere vier Frauen schlossen sich noch am selben Tag Woods Anschuldigungen an.
Manson, der eigentlich Brian Warner heißt, widersprach den Vorwürfen umgehend. Seine Plattenfirma kündigte wegen der Anschuldigungen die Zusammenarbeit mit ihm auf, eine Künstleragentur trennte sich von ihm, auch aus TV-Serien wurde der 54-Jährige nachträglich herausgeschnitten. Lediglich Mansons Ex-Frau Dita Von Teese verteidigte ihn: Die öffentlich gemachten Details passten nicht mit ihren persönlichen Erfahrungen während der sieben Jahre, die sie und Manson ein Paar waren, zusammen.

Die Schauspielerin Esmé Bianco, die wegen „Körperverletzung, Vergewaltigung und anderer Vergehen gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung“ im Zeitraum zwischen 2009 und 2011 Zivilklage gegen Manson erhoben hatte, erzielte im Januar dieses Jahres einen Vergleich vor Gericht. Beide Parteien einigten sich, den Rechtsstreit beizulegen.
Verschiedene weitere Zivilklagen wurden wegen Verjährung zurückgewiesen. Das Ergebnis der Ermittlungen der Staatsanwaltschaft in Los Angeles steht aber weiterhin aus. Und: Erst im Januar hatte eine weitere, heute 44‑jährige Frau eine Zivilklage gegen den Musiker eingereicht. Sie wirft Manson vor, sie im Jahr 1995 nach einem Auftritt an Bord eines Tourbusses zum ersten Mal missbraucht zu haben.

Marilyn Manson: Ashley Morgan Smithline zieht Missbrauchsvorwürfe zurück,"»Schikanen und Drohungen«
Smithline gibt an, Wood und weiteren Frauen, die Manson der sexuellen Gewalt beschuldigen, hätten ihr eingeredet, sie sei auf ähnliche Weise von Manson missbraucht worden.
Ein Repräsentant von Wood bestritt die Vorwürfe. »Evan hat Ashley niemals unter Druck gesetzt oder manipuliert. Es war Ashley, die Evan zuerst auf den Missbrauch ansprach, den sie erlitten hatte«, heißt es in einer Stellungnahme, aus der »People« zitiert. »Es ist bedauerlich, dass die Schikanen und Drohungen, die Ashley nach der Einreichung ihrer Bundesklage erhalten hat, sie offenbar unter Druck gesetzt haben, ihre Aussage zu ändern.«",2023-02-24T12:25:32Z,https://www.spiegel.de,DER SPIEGEL

Model Ashley Smithline recanted accusations that Marilyn Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, sexually abused her during their relationship in 2010, reported People Thursday.
The news comes a month after Smithline's lawsuit against the singer was dismissed by a Los Angeles judge.
According to People, Smithline filed a written declaration to the Los Angeles Superior Court Thursday claiming that she felt pressure from ""Evan Rachel Wood and her associates to make accusations of rape and assault against [Manson] that were not true.""
The model reportedly recalled being invited to a meeting with women who had ""relationships or experiences"" with Manson.
Smithline is quoted as saying in the declaration: ""I remember [Wood] asked me whether I had been, among other things, whipped, chained, tied up, branded/cut, assaulted while sleeping, beaten, or raped. She said all of these things happened to Ms. Wood and others, and that when Ms. Wood was with [Manson] every moment was a moment of survival.
""When I said, no this did not happen to me and this was not my experience, I recall being told by Ms. Wood that just because I could not remember did not necessarily mean that it did not happen.""
Smithline went on to claim she was ""repeatedly gaslit"" by Wood and others, including Manson's former assistant Ashley Walters and ""Game of Thrones"" actor Esmé Bianco, into believing she had experienced similar abuse to the claims they had made against Manson, said the report.
""Eventually, I started to believe that what I was repeatedly told happened to Ms. Wood and Ms. Bianco happened to me,"" Smithline is quoted as saying.
Representatives for Wood denied Smithline's claims in a statement to People.
The statement said: ""Evan never pressured or manipulated Ashley. It was Ashley who first contacted Evan about the abuse she had suffered. It's unfortunate that the harassment and threats Ashley received after filing her federal lawsuit appear to have pressured her to change her testimony.""
Smithline also wrote that her previous civil case and interviews she gave in 2021 ""contained untrue statements"" about Manson, ""including that there was violence and non-consensual sexual activity,"" reported People.
Manson denied Smithline's claims against him and called their relationship ""consensual"" in court documents filed last year, People reported.
Representatives for Smithline, Rachel Wood, and Manson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",2023-02-24T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Marilyn Manson Accuser Ashley Morgan Smithline Recants Sexual Assault Allegations,"5. While at first I knew Mr. Warner did not do these things to me, I eventually I began to question whether he actually did. On numerous occasions, I was told by Ms. Wood, Esme Bianco and others that these things happened to Ms. Wood and Ms. Bianco; asked whether the same things happened to me; and told that I may just be misremembering what happened, repressing my memories of what happened, or that my memories had not yet surfaced—which they said happened to people against whom these acts were perpetrated. I was asked whether I was repressing memories to just get through day-to-day life, and whether it was easier just to not think about what actually happened than accept reality. They also said it was important for people to come forward so that no one else gets hurt.
6. I also recall that in one of the group meetings I attended with Ms. Wood and Ms. Gore, Ms. Gore said they could arrange security for anyone who felt in danger from Mr. Warner. I recall that Ms. Bianco said during this discussion that private investigators had been parked outside of her house and probably were parked outside of mine. I also had separate conversations with Ms. Bianco during this time period in which she told me her relationship with Mr. Warner was similar to that described by Ms. Wood. She insisted that I was repressing memories like she and other supposed victims of Mr. Warner had done.
7. Eventually, I started to believe that what I was repeatedly told happened to Ms. Wood and Ms. Bianco also happened to me.
8. In or around January 2021, I attended a call on which Ms. Wood said that on a certain day she would post to her social media naming Mr. Warner as her abuser, and that we all should do the same on or around the same day. I discussed with Ms. Gore making such a statement on my Instagram page accusing Mr. Warner of abuse. Ms. Gore drafted the statement, and I gave her my password to post it. The narrative ultimately posted to my account on or around February 1, 2021 contained untrue statements about Mr. Warner, including that there was violence and non-consensual sexual activity in our brief relationship, and that I had repressed memories of the same. As another example, there was no branding or cutting experienced during the brief relationship and certainly no “Marilyn Manson” initials carved on my body.
9. On June 29, 2021, a complaint was filed in the lawsuit Ashley Lindsay Morgan Smithline v. Brian Warner et al., Case No. 2:21-cv-5289. The complaint was filed by my attorney at the time, Jay Ellwanger. Ms. Bianco told me Mr. Ellwanger was her lawyer and that I should use him. Mr. Ellwanger did not review the contents of the complaint with me before filing it and did not send me a draft of the complaint to approve before filing it. The complaint contained untrue statements about Mr. Warner, including that there was violence and non-consensual sexual activity in our brief relationship, and that I had repressed memories of the same until meeting with Ms. Wood, Ms. Gore, and others in 2020. Leading up to the filing of the complaint, I felt pressured by Mr. Ellwanger to go on a press tour, which included an interview on The View and an interview and photoshoot with People magazine. I was very uncomfortable doing this press but felt pressured to do it.
10. After the lawsuit was filed on my behalf, I fired Mr. Ellwanger, and the case was dismissed. I never received any money from Mr. Warner and am not seeking any money from him. I have no intention of refiling any lawsuit against Mr. Warner.
11. I never intended to pursue criminal charges against Mr. Warner and have no intention now of ever pursuing criminal charges, as Mr. Warner did not ever assault or abuse me.
12. Looking back, I feel I was manipulated by Ms. Wood, Ms. Gore, Ms. Bianco, and Mr. Ellwanger to spread publicly false accusations of abuse against Mr. Warner.
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Marilyn Manson abuse accuser says she was ‘manipulated’ into making false claims,"The model who accused Marilyn Manson says she was swayed by the rocker’s ex-girlfriends into claiming in 2021 she’d been sexually abused.
Ashley Morgan Smithline filed her declaration in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday, according to People. She reportedly described her 2010 relationship with the “Sweet Dreams” singer as a “brief, consensual sexual” one.

She blamed several women, including actors Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco, for manipulating her into making claims against Manson a decade after her romance with the Grammy nominated performer ended.

Banco and Manson settled a lawsuit in January, People reported. An attorney for Wood reportedly claimed Smithline came to her client to share her story and was “never pressured of manipulated” by the “Westwood” star.
People — which included Smithline in a 2021 cover story — said it corroborated Smithline’s claims through “multiple” sources.
Manson, born Brian Warner, said he “never abused, assaulted, raped, threatened or trafficked” in papers viewed by the celebrity glossy. He and Wood started dating publicly in 2007, when she was 19 and he was 37, according to the Los Angeles Times. That relationship lasted roughly four years.
[ Marilyn Manson accused of sexual assault of a minor in new lawsuit ]
Prior to dating Wood, Manson was married to a burlesque performer who said on Instagram he never abused her, though “infidelity and drug abuse” ended their relationship.
Bianco accused Manson of using “drugs” and “force” to coerce her into sex in her lawsuit. Bianco met Manson in 2009 and dated him for less that two years.
“I basically felt like a prisoner,” Bianco claimed. “I came and went at his pleasure.”
Smithline is a Los Angeles native who started modeling in Asia when she was 13 years old, according to her IMDd page. She comes from a showbiz family and appeared in a 1996 Ricky Schroder movie.",2023-02-24T00:58:14Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News
Evan Rachel Wood 'manipulated' me,"One of Marilyn Manson’s former sexual assault accusers claims in a new legal filing that the shock rocker’s ex Evan Rachel Wood and others “manipulated” her into making false rape allegations.
“I succumbed to pressure from Evan Rachel Wood and her associates to make accusations of rape and assault against [Manson] that were not true,” Ashley Morgan Smithline says in an explosive declaration obtained by Page Six exclusively on Thursday.
The 37-year-old model, who is Jewish, previously accused Manson, 54, of forcibly raping her while cutting her with a swastika-emblazoned knife and shoving his fist in her mouth during sex.
She conducted a national TV interview about her claims on “The View” in June 2021 and filed a lawsuit against the “Dope Show” singer. Her case was then dismissed in January after she failed to find new legal counsel.
Smithline also had a People cover story, in which she shared graphic details of Manson’s alleged abuse. People Magazine
Now, Smithline claims those public appearances and the lawsuit itself were all a farce.
The Los Angeles native says in her declaration that either Wood’s girlfriend, Illma Gore, or Ashley Walters — Manson’s former assistant who also previously sued him — contacted her in 2020.
The women allegedly proposed that Smithline participate in group meetings with others who claimed to be “victims” of Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, including Wood.

Smithline claims she was asked in the meetings whether she had been “whipped, chained, tied up, branded, cut, assaulted while sleeping, beaten, or raped” by Manson, and she allegedly responded, “No, this did not happen to me, and this was not my experience.”
However, she claims Wood, 35, told her that “just because she could not remember” those things “did not necessarily mean that it did not happen,” alleging it was possible she had “repressed” memories due to her alleged trauma.

“While at first I knew Mr. Warner did not do these things to me, I eventually I began
to question whether he actually did,” Smithline says.
“I was asked whether [I] was repressing memories to just get through day-to-day life, and whether it was easier just to not think about what actually happened than accept reality. They also said it was important for people to come forward so that no one else gets hurt.”

In February 2021, Wood publicly named Manson as her alleged abuser for the first time. According to Smithline, the “Thirteen” star allegedly advised her — and others — to do the same.
Smithline claims since she had begun to believe what she was “told” about Manson, she allegedly allowed Gore to draft and then post a statement onto her Instagram.
“The narrative ultimately posted to my account on or around February 1, 2021 contained untrue statements about Mr. Warner, including that there was violence and non-consensual sexual activity in our brief relationship, and that I had repressed memories of
the same,” the model says in her declaration.

Page Six has reached Gore for comment and a rep for Wood declined to comment.
However, a source tells us the only time the “Westworld” actress met Smithline was on-camera while filming a documentary.
Manson’s attorney, Howard King, tells Page Six that Smithline contacted him and his team of her own volition last week and has apologized to the singer.
“She was a reluctant participant [in Wood’s alleged scheme] from the get-go,” the lawyer says, noting that Smithline told him she never had any financial motivation for allegedly “lying” about Manson.

“For a moment in time, having been questioned so many times by Evan Rachel Wood about this ‘repressed memory’ and being told, ‘You’re not remembering what happened,’ she believed it for a minute.”
King also points out that the attorney who represented Smithline in her lawsuit against Manson, Jay Ellwanger, was allegedly “given to her” by Esmé Bianco, who had her own sexual assault suit against the “Beautiful People” singer.
“[Ellwanger] wrote a complaint without talking to [Smithline] about what the factual allegations were and they filed it,” King alleges. “They wore her down.”
Esmé Bianco previously accused Manson of allegedly drugging, torturing and sexually assaulting her. Getty Images
Ellwanger tells Page Six that his response is “constrained by ethical obligations regarding client confidentiality, even to a former client,” but adds that the “specific allegations” we described “are categorically and verifiably false.”
King claims Smithline felt “uncomfortable” filming Wood’s documentary, “Phoenix Rising,” and very quickly realized she was not being “honorable.”
Manson’s attorney Howard King says Smithline was not compensated for speaking in favor of his client. KING, HOLMES, PATERNO & SORIANO, LLP
When asked why the model continued to reiterate her rape claims to the press at different times, the attorney reasserts that Smithline felt “emotionally manipulated” by Wood, Bianco, 40, and Ellwanger.
King also tells Page Six that Smithline has not been compensated for speaking in favor of his client and against Wood — which the model also affirms herself in her declaration.
“I never received any money from Mr. Warner and am not seeking any money from him,” Smithline says. “I have no intention of refiling any lawsuit against Mr. Warner.”
She concludes, “Looking back, I feel I was manipulated by Ms. Wood, Ms. Gore, Ms. Bianco and Mr. Ellwanger to spread publicly false accusations of abuse against Mr. Warner.”
Page Six has reached out to Bianco for comment.
Aside from Smithline’s case dismissal, Walter’s lawsuit was also dismissed in May 2022 after a judge ruled that it had surpassed the statute of limitations. Bianco’s case was settled outside of court earlier this year.

Until then, I’m going to let the facts speak for themselves.” Redferns Advertisement
When asked whether the settlement was a way to financially compensate an alleged victim in order for them to “quietly go away,” King tells Page Six that Bianco was the only one who has gotten paid and that she got a “fraction” of what she was asking for.
“It was paid for primarily by an insurance company,” the top Hollywood attorney adds. “Had we known that Smithline was going to come forward with this type of information, Brian would not have paid a cent even if it was insurance company money.
“We were facing months and months of legal fees, the insurance money was running out and the insurance company offered to pay a significant portion of the settlement,” he further explains.

King claims that it would not have been costly for Bianco to continue fighting the suit on her behalf because the lawyer representing alleged victims is paid via a “contingency” fee, meaning the attorneys don’t get paid unless they win the case.
There is one woman, however, left standing in a court of law: an accuser known only as Jane Doe, who claimed Manson sexually assaulted her when she was just a teen.
“Brian has never met that girl — unless they shook hands at a meet-and-greet,” King says in response, claiming there are “rampant inconsistencies” in her story. “That lawsuit is ripe with incendiary, irrelevant factual allegations. It didn’t happen.”

In total, more than a dozen women have made allegations of sexual impropriety against Manson, but not all of them have pursued legal action.
Meanwhile, Manson has filed his own lawsuit; he’s suing Wood for conspiracy and Gore for defamation, insisting they had conspired against him for their own financial gain.

"Lawsuit Over Marilyn Manson Spitting, Nose-Blowing Incident Is Dismissed","A judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed against Marilyn Manson by a camera operator who alleged the shock rocker approached her twice during a 2019 concert in New Hampshire, spitting upon her the first time and later blowing substance onto her from his nose.
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Audra Mori's ruling Wednesday regarding plaintiff Susan Fountain's lawsuit was ""without prejudice,'' meaning the door is not closed to the case being revived later. No attorney or party in the case appeared for what was the scheduled trial date.
Fountain's suit alleged assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. She was working in front of the stage at the Manson concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford, N.H., on Aug. 18, 2019, and stood on a platform and case to try and get the best shots, according to the suit brought in August 2021.
At about 8:15 p.m., Manson, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, moved toward Fountain, stooped down and spat into her camera lens, with the spray falling onto her right hand, the suit stated.

Both the camera lens and hood had to be cleaned, the suit stated.
""Ms. Fountain was shocked and disgusted by (Manson's) conduct,'' the suit stated.
The director who was nearby called the incident ""gross and disgusting,'' according to the suit.
After Fountain resumed her work, Manson again approached her, but this time she left the platform quickly to avoid another incident and the singer walked away, the suit states. The veteran camera operator then started filming from a higher angle, the suit stated.
However, Manson, now 54, then abruptly turned around and again stepped near Fountain and blew a substance from one of his nostrils at her, the suit states. An angry Fountain cursed at Manson, who showed no reaction, the suit stated.
""(Manson) mocked and pointed at Ms. Fountain while laughing in her face,'' the suit stated.
The alleged assault was captured on the large venue monitors, and some fans who recorded what Manson did later posted their video on YouTube, the suit stated.
""After being humiliated and assaulted with bodily fluids, she immediately left the pit and went to the restroom facilities,'' the suit stated.
Fountain was wearing short sleeves and shorts and had to wash her arms and legs, the suit stated.
Fountain was unable to continue her work for the remainder of the event, the suit states. She later underwent two tests within several months to ensure that she had not contracted any communicable diseases, the suit stated.",2023-02-16T09:24:10Z,https://www.nbcboston.com,NBC10 Boston
"Modelo retira acusação de abuso contra Marilyn Manson: ""Cedi à pressão""","CB Correio Braziliense
(crédito: LISA O'CONNOR)
A modelo Ashley Morgan Smithline, que acusou o músico Marilyn Manson de abuso sexual, afirmou ter sido manipulada e pressionada pela atriz Evan Rachel Wood a fazer a denúncia. Ashley fez as acusações contra o cantor após uma ex-namorada dele relatar abusos. Outras mulheres também relataram abusos.
De acordo com a revista norte-americana People, Ashley fez o registro das alegações contra Evan Rachel Wood em um documento apresentado nesta quinta-feira (23/2) à Corte Superior de Los Angeles, um mês após ela retirar a acusação contra Marilyn Manson.
“Eu cedi à pressão de Evan Rachel Wood e suas colegas para fazer acusações falsas de estupro e agressão [contra Manson]”, diz a declaração entregue pela modelo, que agora alega ter tido “um relacionamento sexual breve e consensual” com o Manso em 2010.
Um representante de Evan Rachel Wood negou as acusações contra a atriz. “A Evan nunca pressionou ou manipulou a Ashley. Foi a Ashley que primeiro entrou em contato com a Evan sobre o abuso que sofreu. É lamentável que as ameaças sofridas pela Ashley após o processo tenham aparentemente resultado na mudança de seu depoimento”, diz o texto assinado pelo advogado.
O processo segue em aberto
Mesmo com a retirada da acusação de Ashley Morgan, o processo contra Manso envolvendo Wood e outras 14 mulheres segue em aberto.

Sexual Assault Survivors Call On Music Industry to Take Action,"On the eve of Grammys weekend, a group of sexual assault survivors came together to call on the music industry to take action against sexual predators and those who enable them.
“We need to take concrete steps to make sure that the music industry is safe and equitable,” said Melissa Schuman, a former member of the 2000s girl group Dream, who previously accused Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter of rape, which he has vigorously denied.
“How much does music care?” Schuman asked, referencing Friday’s MusiCares Person of the Year gala, a Grammy tradition which raises funds to assist music professionals in need.
Alexa Nikolas, the actor known from Nickelodeon’s “Zoey 101” tearfully took the podium Friday afternoon at press conference held at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles.
“I have seen the music industry publicly participate in smear campaigns that have come up about me,” Nikolas said. “It’s time to turn down the music and listen to what countless survivors of this industry have to say… Predators will come and go, but as long as institutions like the music industry enable and participate in the abuse and silencing towards survivors, then it won’t matter if ‘one bad apple,’ as they love to say, gets let go.”
She continued: “Mark a survivor’s words: the music industry is the Catholic Church on steroids.”
Nikolas filed a suit against her ex-husband, the musician Milosh, in 2021, accusing him of sexual abuse and grooming her when she was a teenager. Nikolas eventually dropped her suit, and Milosh sued her attorneys for malicious prosecution, alleging they filed a frivolous lawsuit.
Schuman, who was the first woman to come forward with allegations against Carter, was with a countersuit earlier this week by the Backstreet Boys member, who claims she, along with another rape accuser, took advantage of the #MeToo movement to “defame and vilify” him.
The crux of the press conference was for the women to share their allegations of abuse, trauma and silencing by high-profile figures in the music business.
The women were joined by attorney Jeff Anderson, of St. Paul, Minn-based Jeff Anderson & Associates. Anderson who recently filed separate lawsuits on behalf of two women, one who alleged she was abused as a minor by Marilyn Manson, and another who makes similar claims against Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler. Anderson called on the music industry to stop the use of non-disclosure agreements to silence women, and demanded an end to the “systematic concealment” of abuse across the industry.
“We demand and invite the industry to do the right thing,” Anderson said, calling on MusiCares, the Recording Academy’s nonprofit that assists music professionals
in need, to support survivors. Anderson’s news conference was held in downtown Los Angeles’ L.A. Live complext, hours before MusiCares hosted its annual Grammys weekend gala at the nearby Los Angeles Convention Center. “Let’s work together to pursue and honor the survivors that have spoken the truth and have dared to care in a way those so many in this industry have chosen not to.”
While the #MeToo movement has swept across the television and film business, the music industry has been criticized for being slower to respond. The woman who spoke on Friday afternoon asserted that the industry needs to develop better practices and reporting structures to stop abuse.
Noma Abadi, a musician and composer who founded the Female Composer Safety League, which she said has more than 200 members, said that she did not vote for the Grammys this year, even though she is a member of the Recording Academy.
“I was unable to bring myself to vote,” she said. “I simply cannot fathom the idea of going along with an industry that allows ‘Silence Breakers’ to be ripped of opportunities because we spoke out. We should not have to chose between being artists and activists.”
Sandra Booker, a singer, songwriter, playwright, actor and activist, said that “nothing was done” after she made accusations within the industry. “I became the villain instead of the victim,” she said.
“I am here to call out the people who stand in solidarity with predators and give them protection year after year,” Booker said. “We can stop this. The choice is ours. I appeal to MusiCares and this entire industry to stake a stand.”
Anderson said that he and others who spoke out will be attending MusiCares event tonight where they plan to “demand and implore” the industry to protect survivors.
“It’s time for the cleanup of the coverup,” Anderson said.",2023-02-04T00:30:00Z,https://variety.com,Variety
Nach anonymer Anklage: Beging Marylin Manson Sexualstraftaten in den 90ern?,"Dallas - ""Eingesperrt, missbraucht und psychisch terrorisiert"": Das Magazin Spiegel berichtete vor zwei Jahren über die angeblichen sexuellen Machenschaften des US-Schockrockers Marilyn Manson (54). Nun sind neue Vorwürfe gegen Manson aufgetaucht, die zu den Ursprüngen seiner Musikerlaufbahn führen und finstere Abgründe offenlegen sollen. Oder ist doch alles falsch und man verwechselt Künstler-Image mit Real-Life-Persönlichkeit?

Marilyn Manson ist die ultimative Projektionsfläche für alle möglichen bizarren Fantasien. Damit hat er zwar weltweiten Erfolg erreicht, aber das holt ihn im echten Leben immer wieder ein.
Die neuste Klage gegen den 54-jährigen Künstler ist ein Novum. Denn er wird wegen möglicher sexueller Vergehen angeklagt, die knapp 30 Jahre zurückliegen.
In den 1990ern soll Manson einem Bericht des Magazins Rolling Stone zufolge ""ein minderjähriges Mädchen mehrfach sexuell missbraucht haben"".
Die anonym eingereichte Klage wirft Manson vor, 1995 die Minderjährige in den Tourbus verführt zu haben. Dort soll es zu ""sexueller Nötigung und [...] vorsätzlichem Zufügen von seelischem Leid"" gekommen sein, berichtet Rolling Stone weiter.
Auch nach diesem Vorfall seien Manson und die als Jane Doe bezeichnete anonyme Klägerin im Kontakt geblieben. Dieser Kontakt habe sich fatal auf das Leben der Klägerin ausgewirkt, heißt es.
Manson veröffentlichte über seinen Anwalt ein Statement - und erinnert sich nicht.",2023-02-01T20:30:00Z,https://www.tag24.de,TAG24
Marilyn Manson Sued For Allegedly Sexually Assaulting Minor In 1990s: Report,"A woman only known as Jane Doe claims Marilyn Manson “groomed and sexually assaulted” her several times in the 1990s. Rolling Stone reported on the allegations that were listed in Doe’s lawsuit against the shock rocker. This is the latest controversy plaguing Manson, as he has been accused of rape, abuse, and assault for years.
This is reportedly the first sexual assault lawsuit from the early days of Manson’s fame. Doe, who also names Nothing Records and Interscope in her suit, says she met the singer in 1995 when she was 16. She was with her friends when she claims she waited to meet Manson outside his tour bus.

The woman alleges Manson invited her “and one of the other younger girls” onto the bus and exchanged information.
“While on the tour bus, Defendant Warner performed various acts of criminal sexual conduct upon Plaintiff, who was a virgin at the time, including but not limited to forced copulation and vaginal penetration,” the lawsuit claims.
“One of the band members watched Defendant Warner sexually assault Plaintiff,” the suit adds. “Plaintiff was in pain, scared, upset, humiliated and confused. After he was done, Defendant Warner laughed at her. … Then Defendant Warner demanded Plaintiff to ‘get the f*ck off of my bus’ and threatened Plaintiff that, if she told anyone, he would kill her and her family.”

The accuser asserts she “began using drugs and alcohol shortly after,” continuing on for years. She also maintained a relationship with Manson, who she says asked “for explicit photos of her and her friends.”
It was also alleged that Manson’s record labels were well aware of his alleged behaviors. Manson issued a statement to Rolling Stone via his attorney, Howard King.
He claims the singer “does not know this individual and has no recollection of ever having met her 28 years ago. He certainly was never intimate with her.”
King further called Doe’s story a “fabricated tale,“ adding, “even the most minimal amount of scrutiny reveals the obvious discrepancies in her ever-shifting stories as well as her extensive collusion with other false accusers … Brian will not submit to this shakedown – and the courts won’t fall for it either.”

Denuncian a Marilyn Manson en Nueva York por agresión sexual a menor en 1995,"El cantante estadounidense Marilyn Manson fue objeto de una denuncia el lunes 30 de enero en Nueva York por agresión sexual a una menor de edad en 1995, caso abierto gracias a una ventana legal que permite temporalmente juzgar este tipo de casos hasta ahora prescritos.
El artista, llamado Brian Warner, de 54 años, está acusado de violar cuando tenía 26, al inicio de su carrera, a una chica de 16 a la que conoció tras uno de sus conciertos, y de manipularla y abusar de ella hasta 1999 bajo el auspicio de ejecutivos musicales y con la colaboración de sus socios.
La denuncia también implica a los sellos discográficos del artista, Interscope Music y Nothing Records, que están acusados de “celebrar y promover” las “obsesiones pedófilas y comportamientos violentos” de Warner “para su ganancia financiera colectiva”.
“Amenazó con matarla”
El documento indica que la denunciante era virgen cuando Manson la violó por primera vez en el autobús de gira y en presencia de un miembro de su banda, y agrega que después la humilló, la amenazó con matarla a ella y a su familia si se lo contaba a alguien y la echó de malas maneras.
Pese a ello, el cantante contactó con la víctima para chatear con ella, pedirle fotos explícitas para su club de fans e invitarla a más conciertos, lo que la llevó a viajar a “numerosas ciudades y estados, incluyendo Nueva York”, y a ser invitada a la zona de bastidores y el autobús de gira.
En 1999, durante unas cuatro semanas en una gira, Manson supuestamente forzó de nuevo a tener sexo a la víctima, entonces de 19 años, y “a menudo” la obligó a hacerlo con “él y otros miembros de la banda o su asistente a la vez”.
”Como es típico con un depredador sexual, el acusado Warner siguió ejerciendo poder y autoridad para mantener control sobre la denunciante. Como resultado (...) de su comportamiento opresivo y constante, la denunciante fue incapaz de defender y salir del abuso”, agrega.
La denuncia también indica que en 2021, la víctima publicó su relato en internet y sufrió represalias, y cree que el acusado y su esposa están recurriendo a un canal de YouTube que desacredita a mujeres que lo han acusado de abusos para intentar acallarla.
El polémico artista ha sido acusado en los últimos años de abusos sexuales y psicológicos por más de una decena de mujeres, entre ellas la actriz Evan Rachel Wood, algo que este siempre ha negado asegurando que sus relaciones han sido “consensuadas con parejas con ideas similares”.

Marilyn Manson accusé d’agression sexuelle sur une mineure,"Gary Miller via Getty Images Gary Miller via Getty Images
JUSTICE - Le musicien Marilyn Manson est de nouveau sous le feu des projecteurs, mais pas pour de bonnes raisons. Brian Warner – de son vrai nom – est accusé d’agression sexuelle sur une mineure, en 1995. L’affaire a été prise en charge par le tribunal de Long Island, dans l’État de New Yord (États-Unis).
La plaignante préfère rester anonyme mais a déposé plainte sous le nom de « Jane Doe », selon Rolling Stone. Âgée de 16 ans au moment des faits, elle accuse le chanteur d’avoir abusé d’elle. À l’époque, l’adolescente avait attendu Marilyn Manson après un concert à Dallas. Le rockeur a fait monter la jeune fille dans son bus de tournée, ainsi qu’une autre fan.
Marilyn Manson aurait forcé l’adolescente « à avoir un rapport sexuel avec pénétration vaginale » alors que « l’un des membres du groupe regardait » la scène, rapporte le magazine américain.
Menace de mort
Elle se sentait « effrayée, humiliée et perdue », d’autant plus que le chanteur « s’est moqué d’elle » alors qu’elle avait « mal ». Après l’avoir agressé, Marilyn Manson l’aurait fait descendre de son bus tout en menaçant de « la tuer, elle et sa famille, si elle racontait ce qui s’était passé ».
Mais l’histoire ne s’arrête pas là. La victime mentionne sa plainte une autre agression sexuelle, datant cette fois de 1999 alors qu’elle suivait le chanteur pendant sa tournée. La plaignante accuse le rocker d’avoir fait d’elle son objet sexuel alors qu’elle était tout juste majeure. Elle dénonce l’empreinte psychologique mise en place par Marylin Manson.
« Jane Doe » attaque aussi en justice les maisons de disques Interscope et Nothing Records pour avoir protégé son artiste au moment des faits.
L’avocat de Marilyn Manson a déclaré à Rolling Stone que le chanteur « ne connaît pas » la victime et n’a « aucun souvenir de l’avoir même rencontrée, il y a vingt-huit ans. »

Marilyn Manson soll 16-Jährige vergewaltigt haben,"1/5 Happige Vorwürfe gegen Schock-Rocker Marilyn Manson.
US-Rockstar Marilyn Manson (54) kommt nicht aus den Negativschlagzeilen. Eine heute 43-jährige Frau beteuert, Manson habe sie in eine «dunkle Welt der Alkohol- und Drogensucht, sexueller Abschweifungen, Körperverletzung und psychischen Missbrauch» hineingezogen. Die Frau hat am Montag in New York eine Zivilklage vor dem Nassau County Supreme Court eingereicht. Demnach habe sie im September 1995 mit 16 ein Konzert von Manson, der mit bürgerlichem Namen Brian Warner heisst, in Dallas besucht. Manson habe sie und eine weitere junge Frau nach dem Konzert in seinen Tourbus eingeladen.
Dort soll er sie zuerst nach Alter, Telefonnummern und Adressen gefragt und sich dann erkundigt haben, wo ihre Eltern seien. Laut Klageschrift, in die die «New York Post» Einsicht hatte, soll Manson dann an der Klägerin «verschiedene kriminelle sexuelle Akte» durchgeführt haben. Bandmitglieder sollen dabei zugesehen haben, wie der Sänger die Frau «zu Oralsex und vaginalem Verkehr gezwungen hat». Nach dem Akt habe er sie mit den Worten «verpiss dich aus meinem Bus» hinausgeworfen. Anwalt Jeff Andersen (75), der das als «Jane Doe» (fiktiver weiblicher Name für eine Partei in einem Rechtsstreit) anonymisierte Opfer vertritt, behauptet weiter: «Zuerst hat er meiner Mandantin gedroht, ihre Familie umzubringen, wenn sie darüber sprechen würde, was passiert ist!»
Weitere Attacken in der Folge
Wochen später soll sie Manson dann telefonisch kontaktiert, von ihr Nacktfotos gefordert und sie zu einem Konzert am 9. Dezember 1995 in Louisiana eingeladen haben: «Danach hat er sich wieder sexuell an ihr vergriffen.» Das Opfer habe danach ihren Schmerz und ihre Scham durch Alkohol und Drogen betäubt und sei davon abhängig geworden.
Laut Klage hat Manson sie 1999, drei Jahre später, dann noch einmal einen Monat lang sexuell missbraucht: «Er hat sie manipuliert, sie unter Drogen gesetzt und sie dazu gebracht, auch mit seinen Bandmitgliedern Sex zu haben.» Damals war der Rocker mit Schauspielerin Rose McGowan (49) verlobt. Das Opfer verlangt ein bislang noch nicht genanntes Schmerzensgeld von Manson – sowie von seinen damaligen Plattenfirmen Interscope Music und Nothings Records – «die Mansons sexuelle Ausschweifungen und pädophile Neigungen unterstützt und davon profitiert haben!», so die Klageschrift.
Manson-Anwalt dementiert
Manson-Anwalt Howard King dementiert alle Vorwürfe: «Mein Mandant kennt ‹Jane Doe› überhaupt nicht und war niemals intim mit ihr. Die Klage ist voller hinterhältiger Lügen und nicht mehr als eine Erpressung, um Geld herauszuschlagen. Das sogenannte Opfer geht mit ihrer erfundenen Story bereits seit zwei Jahren hausieren. Wir werden uns nicht erpressen lassen.» (cth/las)",2023-01-31T13:51:09Z,https://www.blick.ch,BLICK.CH
Marilyn Manson es denunciado por abuso sexual contra una menor en 1995,"La denuncia también implica a los sellos discográficos del artista. | Fuente: AFP
El cantante estadounidense Marilyn Manson fue objeto de una denuncia el último lunes en Nueva York por agresión sexual a una menor de edad en 1995, caso abierto gracias a una ventana legal que permite temporalmente juzgar este tipo de casos hasta ahora prescritos.
El artista, llamado Brian Warner, de 54 años, es acusado de violar a una chica de 16 a la que conoció tras uno de sus conciertos, de manipularla y abusar de ella hasta 1999 bajo el auspicio de ejecutivos musicales y con la colaboración de sus socios.
La denuncia también implica a los sellos discográficos del artista, Interscope Music y Nothing Records, que están acusados de ""celebrar y promover"" las ""obsesiones pedófilas y comportamientos violentos"" de Warner ""para su ganancia financiera colectiva"".
El testimonio de la denunciante
El documento indica que la denunciante era virgen cuando Manson la violó por primera vez en el autobús de gira y en presencia de un miembro de su banda, y agrega que después la humilló, la amenazó con matarla a ella y a su familia si se lo contaba a alguien y la echó de malas maneras.
Pese a ello, el cantante contactó con la víctima para chatear con ella, pedirle fotos explícitas para su club de fans e invitarla a más conciertos, lo que la llevó a viajar a ""numerosas ciudades y estados, incluyendo Nueva York"", y a ser invitada a la zona de bastidores y el autobús de gira.
En 1999, durante unas cuatro semanas en una gira, Manson supuestamente forzó de nuevo a tener sexo a la víctima, entonces de 19 años, y ""a menudo"" la obligó a hacerlo con ""él y otros miembros de la banda o su asistente a la vez"".
""Como es típico con un depredador sexual, el acusado Warner siguió ejerciendo poder y autoridad para mantener control sobre la denunciante. Como resultado (...) de su comportamiento opresivo y constante, la denunciante fue incapaz de defender y salir del abuso"", agrega.
La denuncia también indica que en 2021, la víctima publicó su relato en internet y sufrió represalias, y cree que el acusado y su esposa están recurriendo a un canal de YouTube que desacredita a mujeres que lo han acusado de abusos para intentar acallarla.

Más denuncias por abusos sexuales
El artista ha sido acusado en los últimos años de abusos sexuales y psicológicos por más de una decena de mujeres, entre ellas la actriz Evan Rachel Wood, algo que este siempre ha negado asegurando que sus relaciones han sido ""consensuadas con parejas con ideas similares"".
El músico, que negó los hechos, ha respondido a esas denuncias con una demanda en la que acusa a Wood y a una colaboradora suya, Ashley Gore, de ""reclutar, coordinar y presionar"" a otras mujeres para que testifiquen contra él.
Según Manson, las dos mujeres escribieron una carta en la que se hacían pasar por un agente del FBI que estaba investigando al músico. Dicha misiva habría presionado a los receptores para que demandaran a Manson y además facilitaba un supuesto ""guion"" con una lista de delitos que debían narrar a las autoridades.
Sin embargo, de acuerdo con la cadena NBC, que ha tenido acceso a ese documento, el escrito al que se refiere el músico no incluye el logotipo del FBI y presenta a Wood como ""testigo clave"" de una investigación criminal hacia una ""figura pública muy conocida"".

Lawsuit accuses Marilyn Manson of sexually assaulting underage girl multiple times,"(The Hill) – Musician Marilyn Manson is facing more allegations of sexual misconduct, accused in a lawsuit filed on Monday of sexually assaulting an underage girl multiple times in the 1990s.
The woman in the lawsuit, who is filing under the name Jane Doe, says in her complaint that Manson started to “target” her in 1995 when she was 16, using his “role, status, and power as an adult and performer in the music industry to gain access to, groom, manipulate and exploit” her. This targeting ultimately resulted in two separate incidents of sexual assault, the complaint alleges.
The complaint says that the first incident took place on Manson’s tour bus after a concert in September 1995, where he “took” the plaintiff and another young girl onto his bus. The complaint states that Manson performed multiple acts of “criminal sexual conduct” on the plaintiff, and later contacted her at her home and asked her to send explicit photos of her and her friends to his fan club.
Later that year, the complaint alleges, Manson sexually assaulted her again on a separate occasion on his tour bus after a show.
The complaint also states that in 1999, when the woman was 19, Manson “perpetuated his grooming, manipulation, exploitation and sexual assault” of her for a period of four weeks.
The Hill has reached out to Manson’s representatives for comment.
Manson, who’s real name is Brian Warner, has faced multiple allegations accusing him of sexual harassment and abuse over the years. Earlier this month, he settled a lawsuit with “Game of Thrones” actress Esmé Bianco, who in 2021 accused him of raping her and coercing her to do several sexual acts in 2011.
More than a dozen women have accused Manson of abusive behavior, including actress Evan Rachel Wood, who detailed her allegations in a documentary released last year.
The complaint also listed Manson’s former label companies as defendants in the lawsuit, alleging that they knew that the artist was targeting underage girls and aided him in doing so. The complaint also said the labels “knowingly, intentionally, willfully, deliberately, and recklessly fostered a pervasive and hostile environment for the purpose of financial gain that utterly disregarded the rights and safety of the band’s young fans.”
“Upon information and belief, Defendants Interscope and Nothing Records were ware of Defendant Warner’s practice of sexually assaulting minors, and aided and abetted such behavior,” the complaint stated.
“As a result of Brian Warner’s sexual abuse and assault, enabled and encouraged by Defendants Interscope and Nothing Records, Plaintiff has suffered severe emotional, physical and psychological distress, including shame, and guilt, economic loss, economic capacity and emotional loss,” the complaint continued.",2023-01-31T12:39:41Z,https://www.wcia.com,wcia.com

Marilyn Manson: Καταγγελίες για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση ανήλικης,"Δεν έχουν τέλος
Ο Marilyn Manson αντιμετωπίζει νέα μήνυση για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση ενός 16χρονου κοριτσιού. Η κακοποίηση, σύμφωνα με δημοσιεύματα στον διεθνή Τύπο, συνέβη το 1995, στο Nassau της Νέας Υόρκης.
Το φερόμενο ως θύμα είπε ότι η κακοποίηση συνέβη τον Σεπτέμβριο μετά από μία από τις συναυλίες του Manson. Όλα έγιναν στο λεωφορείο με το οποίο ταξίδευε ο τραγουδιστής.

«Ενώ βρισκόταν στο λεωφορείο της περιοδείας, ο Marilyn Manson προέβη σε διάφορες πράξεις εγκληματικής σεξουαλικής συμπεριφοράς σε βάρος της ενάγουσας, η οποία ήταν παρθένα εκείνη την εποχή, συμπεριλαμβανομένων, μεταξύ άλλων, της βίαιης συνουσίας και της κολπικής διείσδυσης», αναφέρει η καταγγελία, σύμφωνα με την ιστοσελίδα «Insider».
Σύμφωνα με την κατάθεση, ο Manson, του οποίου το πραγματικό όνομα είναι Brian Warner, μέσα σε λίγες εβδομάδες άρχισε να τηλεφωνεί στην κοπέλα και να της ζητά «να στείλει άσεμνες φωτογραφίες της ίδιας και των φίλων της στο fan club του, Satan’s Bakesale».

Esme Bianco: Απέσυρε τη μήνυση εναντίον του Marilyn Manson για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση,"Η ίδια είχε ισχυριστεί ότι ο διάσημος τραγουδιστής την είχε κακοποιήσει σεξουαλικά, σωματικά και συναισθηματικά
Η ηθοποιός του «Game of Thrones», Esme Bianco, απέσυρε τη μήνυση εναντίον του Marilyn Manson για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση, προκειμένου να προχωρήσει στη ζωή της, σύμφωνα με τον δικηγόρο της. Η ίδια είχε ισχυριστεί ότι ο διάσημος τραγουδιστής την είχε κακοποιήσει σεξουαλικά, σωματικά και συναισθηματικά. Ο δικηγόρος της, Jay Ellwanger, δήλωσε ότι η 40χρονη, γνωστή από τον ρόλο της ως Ros στη σειρά του HBO, κατέληξε σε συμφωνία.
Ο νομικός εκπρόσωπος του Μάνσον επιβεβαίωσε, επίσης, τη συμφωνία, με τον ροκ μουσικό να υποστηρίζει ότι οι ισχυρισμοί εναντίον του ήταν «αποδεδειγμένα ψευδείς» και ότι «απλώς δεν συνέβησαν ποτέ». Αυτή είναι η τρίτη μήνυση που αποσύρεται εναντίον του 54χρονου Μάνσον, αφού η πρώην βοηθός του και ένα μοντέλο κατέθεσαν παρόμοιες καταγγελίες.
Η Bianco ισχυρίστηκε ότι ο Μάνσον, το όνομά του είναι Brian Warner, παραβίασε το νόμο περί εμπορίας ανθρώπων, φέρνοντάς την στην Καλιφόρνια από την Αγγλία το 2009 και το 2011, με ψευδείς προφάσεις ότι θα πρωταγωνιστούσε σε μουσικά βίντεο και ταινίες. Στέρησε από την ηθοποιό το φαγητό και τον ύπνο, την κλείδωσε σε μια κρεβατοκάμαρα, τη μαστίγωσε, της έκανε ηλεκτροσόκ και απείλησε να μπει στο δωμάτιό της και να τη βιάσει κατά τη διάρκεια της νύχτας, σύμφωνα με τα έγγραφα της αγωγής.
Ο Μάνσον μηνύει, επίσης, την πρώην αρραβωνιαστικιά του, Έβαν Ρέιτσελ Γουντ, για συκοφαντική δυσφήμιση, λέγοντας ότι τον έχει παρουσιάσει ως «βιαστή και κακοποιό». Ισχυρίζεται ότι η ηθοποιός συνωμότησε με έναν φίλο της και είπαν ψέματα, στην προσπάθειά τους να πείσουν κι άλλες γυναίκες να καταθέσουν.
Ο πέντε φορές υποψήφιος για Grammy, Marilyn Manson, ισχυρίζεται ότι η καριέρα του βρίσκεται στα «τάρταρα» και ότι εξακολουθεί να δέχεται απειλές για τη ζωή του από τότε που 15 γυναίκες τον κατηγόρησαν για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση πέρυσι.

Nouvelle accusation contre Marilyn Manson : le rockeur soupçonné d'avoir violé une mineure de 16 ans,"Marilyn Manson est une nouvelle fois dans la tourmente. Le rockeur est accusé d'un nouveau viol par une femme. Pour la première fois, les faits reprochés se seraient produits dans les années 90, soit au début de sa carrière.
Nouvelles lourdes accusations à l'encontre de Marilyn Manson. Selon le magazine Rolling Stone, le chanteur est la cible d'une nouvelle plainte pour viol. Contrairement aux précédentes, celle-ci concernerait des incidents qui se seraient déroulés au début de la carrière du rockeur. La victime présumée a préféré rester anonyme mais ne poursuit pas uniquement celui qui est né sous le nom de Brian Warner. En effet, elle attaquerait également en justice les maisons de disques Interscope et Nothing Records. Selon ses déclarations, elle avait 16 ans lorsque Marilyn Manson aurait abusé d'elle. Après un spectacle à Dallas, il lui aurait demandé de monter dans son bus de tournée. C'est à ce moment-là, qu'il aurait commis plusieurs agressions à caractère sexuel.
Seulement, l'accusatrice du chanteur assure que ces faits ne se seraient pas produits qu'une seule fois, puisqu'elle avait suivi le chanteur en tournée. Ainsi, les abus se seraient reproduits à de nombreuses reprises. Elle accuse également l'artiste d'avoir eu un contrôle psychologique sur elle. ""La victime présumée allègue que les maisons de disques Interscope et Nothing Records ont fermé les yeux sur les agissements de Marilyn Manson"", peut-on encore lire dans les colonnes de Rolling Stone.

Marilyn Manson é acusado de assediar jovem nos anos de 1990,"No processo, a autora da ação afirma ter conhecido Manson pela primeira vez em 1995, após um show em Dallas, quando tinha 16 anos
Marilyn Manson está sendo acusado de assédio sexual. O astro do rock é alvo de um processo movido por uma mulher, que preferiu não se identificar, onde é relatado que Manson teria tido comportamentos inadequados com ela quando era adolescente.
No documento, revelado pela revista Rolling Stone nesta segunda, 30, o cantor é identificado como Brian Warner, seu nome verdadeiro, e consta que ele aliciou e agrediu sexualmente uma menina menor de idade várias vezes na década de 1990. Além do artista, as gravadoras da qual ele fez parte na época também são citadas por negligência.
No processo, a autora da ação afirma ter conhecido Manson pela primeira vez em 1995, após um show em Dallas, quando tinha 16 anos. Ela estava acompanhada de um grupo de pessoas esperando o cantor próximo ao ônibus da turnê. Ele a teria convidado para ir no ônibus junto com outras jovens. “O réu Warner realizou vários atos de conduta sexual criminosa contra a autora, que era virgem na época, incluindo, entre outros, cópula forçada e penetração vaginal”, segundo consta no documento.
Marilyn teria expulsado a garota do ônibus e feito ameaças. “A autora estava com dor, assustada, chateada, humilhada e confusa. Depois que ele terminou, riu dela. Então, o réu Warner exigiu: ‘saia do meu ônibus’, e ameaçou ela dizendo que, se contasse a alguém, ele mataria ela e a sua família”, diz o processo. A ação também revela que tais abusos não aconteceram apenas uma vez, mas de forma recorrente, fazendo com que a jovem passasse a usar drogas.
Em declaração à revista, a advogada da vítima, Karen Barth Menzies, reforça que o processo visa responsabilizar também as gravadoras. “Este processo vai além do predador nomeado e tem como alvo as gravadoras que embalaram e lucraram com o comportamento criminoso de seu artista, e é uma acusação da indústria da música por manter uma cultura que celebra, protege e permite predadores sexuais”, destaca.
O advogado de Manson, Howard King, afirmou que o cliente “não conhece essa pessoa e não se lembra de tê-la conhecido 28 anos atrás” e que tudo seria um “conto fabricado”.

Marilyn Manson accused of sexual abuse of a minor in a new lawsuit,"A lawsuit accusing musician Marilyn Manson of ""childhood and adult sexual abuse, sexual battery, assault and molestation"" was filed in New York on Monday.
Two of Manson's former labels, Interscope Records and Nothing Records — an Interscope label that no longer exists — are also named as defendants in the lawsuit, filed in Nassau County, and accused of “protecting, promoting, and profiteering from” his alleged conduct.
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a Jane Doe, alleges Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, sexually assaulted her on his tour bus after an all-ages concert in 1995, when she was 16 years old. It also alleges that Manson threatened to kill her and her family if she told anyone.
Manson groomed the plaintiff, the lawsuit alleges, encouraging her to send explicit pictures of herself and her friends. It also alleges he insisted she attend one of his concerts in 1995 in New Orleans, where he is also alleged to have assaulted her.
The sexual assault continued when the plaintiff was 19 and had moved to Los Angeles to date a member of another band, who had a close association with Manson, the suit alleges. The plaintiff started using drugs and alcohol to self-medicate because of the earlier assaults, and Manson ""purposefully and intentionally laid the groundwork necessary to intimidate and control her"" as a child and was still able to do so beyond that, according to the lawsuit.
The plaintiff attended a 1999 tour of Manson's, during which he groomed and sexually assaulted her throughout, the lawsuit alleges. Manson ""often coerced Plaintiff to have sex with him and other band members or his assistant at the same time"" and provided her with drugs, the lawsuit alleges.
Howard King, an attorney for Manson, called the allegations in the lawsuit ""vicious lies"" and said his client ""will not submit to this shakedown.""
“Brian Warner does not know this individual and has no recollection of ever having met her 28 years ago. He certainly was never intimate with her,"" King said in a statement. ""She has been shopping her fabricated tale to tabloids and on podcasts for more than two years.""
Attorneys for the plaintiff say Manson, his band and promoters provided children with posters that had symbols “relating to violence, sexual assault, and Satan,” with one flier including the lyrics, “I am the pedophile’s dream.”
“For too long, music industry predators have hidden in plain sight, believing they are above the law,” said Jeff Anderson, an attorney for the plaintiff. “Today, we are demanding Warner face retribution, so he knows he will no longer escape his day in court. This is a day of reckoning.”
The lawsuit also accuses Interscope and Nothing Records of negligence, saying they ""knew or should have known that Defendant Warner was habitually and routinely engaged in sexual misconduct with young adults and underage children throughout the country.""
Interscope Records did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nothing Records was a label created by musician Trent Reznor through Interscope Records.
“Sexual predators in the music industry don’t act alone,"" said Karen Barth Menzies, an attorney for the plaintiff. ""In order for there to be meaningful changes in the music industry, we have to do more than just hold the predators accountable. We have to force the record companies to acknowledge the crimes they allow to occur, and in some instances facilitate, and we have to force them to take responsibility for permitting and profiting from outrageous criminal behavior.”
Manson has been accused of grooming a minor and sexual violence before.
In 2021, Evan Rachel Wood, Manson's former girlfriend, accused him of grooming her as a teenager and abusing her for years. Manson was not charged with any crime connected to Wood’s allegations. He filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood last year.
Manson faced accusations by at least three other women in lawsuits filed against him in 2021.
“Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco sued Manson, alleging he committed multiple violent sexual assaults, a rape and other abuse from 2009 to 2013.
Attorneys for Bianco and Manson said this month that Bianco agreed to resolve her claims against Manson and Marilyn Manson Records Inc. She did so “in order to move on with her life and career,"" Bianco's attorney, Jay Ellwanger, said in a statement Jan. 24.
Ashley Walters, his then-assistant, accused him of sexual exploitation and psychological abuse. The case was dismissed in May, according to Los Angeles County Superior Court records. An appeal is also expected to be formally dismissed after it missed a deadline in the 2nd District Court of Appeals.
Also in 2021, model Ashley Morgan Smithline sued Manson, alleging sexual assault, sexual battery and human trafficking. The case was dismissed without prejudice this month, according to court records.

Rystende overgrepsanklager,"NEW YORK (Dagbladet): I et søksmål, ble sendt inn til myndighetene i New York mandag, anklages musikeren for seksuelle overgrep mot en jente på midten av 1990-tallet, skriver The Guardian.
I søksmålet anklages Manson, som egentlig heter Brian Warner, for å ha begått overgrep mot en jente som var 16 år i 1995 og deretter igjen i 1999.
Den nye anklagen kommer mindre enn én uke etter at Manson inngitt et forlik med skuespilleren Esmé Bianco. Hun saksøkte ham i april 2021 og anklaget ham for voldtekt og seksuelle overgrep.
Flere andre kvinner har også gått offentlig ut med anklager mot Marilyn Manson. Mest kjent er skuespilleren Evan Rachel Wood.
Benekter
- Manson har benektet på det sterkeste alle påstander om seksuelle overgrep eller misbruk av noen, opplyser Mansons advokat.
Artisten saksøkte også Wood for ærekrenkelser og emosjonelt stress.
Det nye søksmålet er sendt inn under New York Adult Survivors Act. Det er en lov, som er ment til å gi ofre for seksuelle overgrep anledning til å saksøke uavhengig av når forbrytelsen skal ha skjedd. Uten denne loven kunne anklager som den nyeste, være foreldet.

Kvinnen bak søksmålet er også anonymisert, men er bosatt i Maryland og født i 1979. Søksmålet hevder at Manson først prøvde seg på saksøkeren i 1995 da hun bare var 16 år gammel. Manson skal, ifølge anklagen, ha brukt rollen, statusen og makten sin som en voksen og artist i musikkbransjen for å få tilgang til, «groome», manipulere og utnytte henne.
Ny anklage
Det skal ha resultert i to tilfeller av seksuelle overfall, ifølge søksmålet.
- Så, i 1999, da saksøker var omtrent 19 år, fortsatte den saksøkte Warner, groomingen, manipulasjonen, utnyttelsen og seksuelle overgrep mot saksøkeren i en periode på cirka fire uker, heter det i søksmålet.
Også plateselskapet Nothing Records og distributøren Interscope Music Publishing, er saksøkte i saken. De anklages for å ha vært «klar over» Mansons «praksis med seksuelle overgrep mot mindreårige, og hjalp og medvirket til slik oppførsel».
FJERNES: Denne scenen blir ikke lenger å se i nye utgivelser av «Toy Story 2». Vis mer
- Den saksøktes pedofile besettelse og voldelige oppførsel var ikke bare kjent for de saksøkte Interscop og Northing Records, men det ble feiret og promovert for deres felles økonomiske vinning, heter det i søksmålet.
- Led alvorlig
Verken Interscope eller Universal Music - som eide det nå nedlagte plateselskapet Nothing Label - har foreløpig kommentert søksmålet.
- Saksøkeren led alvorlig følelsesmessig, fysisk og psykologisk stress, inkludert skam og skyldfølelse, økonomisk tap, og følelsesmessig tap. Ydmykelse, skam og skrekke, som hun vil fortsette å bære med seg resten av livet, heter det i søksmålet.
Nå krever saksøkeren et uspesifisert erstatningsbeløp.
- Altfor lenge har overgripere i musikkindustrien fått gjemme seg på høylys dag og trodd at de er over loven. I dag krever vi at Warner straffes, så han vet at han ikke lenger kan flykte unna sin dag i retten, sier en av saksøkerens advokater Jeff Anderson, ifølge The Guardian.",2023-01-31T02:30:11Z,https://www.dagbladet.no,Dagbladet.no
Marilyn Manson accused of sexually assaulting a minor,"According to a new lawsuit, Marilyn Manson has been sued by an unnamed woman who claims he repeatedly groomed and sexually attacked her in the 1990s when she was a minor. This is the latest in a string of sexual misconduct lawsuits against the singer. According to Variety, a US-based media house, the new lawsuit reported by Rolling Stone, is the first to accuse the artist of misconduct from the beginning of his career, including allegations of sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It also holds his record labels, Interscope and Trent Reznor's Nothing Records, responsible for their negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and other charges.
Variety reports that until now more than a dozen women have come forward and accused the singer of sexual misconduct. Talking about the new lawsuit that has come to the fore, Variety reports that the lawsuit alleges non-consensual sex acts and threats against the plaintiff and her family, despite the fact that the woman continued to see Manson at various tour stops over the years, including a four-week stint on the road with the band during which she engaged in drug use with the band members. Marilyn Manson would allegedly ""groom, harass, and sexually abuse"" her and ""intentionally laid the groundwork necessary to intimidate and control her"" after she had reached the age of consent.
The publication further reports that the lawsuit claims that the record labels for Marilyn Manson ""were well-aware of Defendant Warner's practice of sexually assaulting minors, and aided and abetted such behaviour"", the filing claims. ""As a result of Brian Warner's (Marilyn Manson) sexual abuse and assault, enabled and encouraged by Defendants Interscope and Nothing Records, Plaintiff has suffered severe emotional, physical, and psychological distress, including shame, and guilt, economic loss, economic capacity and emotional loss,"" it claims further.

"El cantante Marilyn Manson, demandado por la presunta violación de una menor en los años noventa","Marilyn Manson asiste a un concierto benéfico en Los Ángeles en diciembre de 2019. Richard Shotwell (Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)
Marilyn Manson afronta una demanda por agresión sexual a una menor, supuestamente cometida a comienzos de la década de los noventa, cuando el artista daba sus primeros pasos en la música. No es la primera vez que el cantante es objeto de una demanda por conducta sexual inapropiada, pero las presentadas anteriormente se referían a hechos presuntamente ocurridos en torno a 2010. Las antiguas discográficas del músico, Interscope y Nothing Records, también figuran como demandadas por no haber hecho nada para impedir la violación y los abusos “en múltiples ocasiones” del músico a una chica de 16 años.
La demandante, que se hace llamar Jane Doe y vive en Maryland (“el nombre utilizado es ficticio para proteger su intimidad como víctima de agresiones y abusos sexuales”, explica la demanda), ha demandado ante el Tribunal Supremo del condado de Nassau, en Long Island (Nueva York), a Brian Warner, el verdadero nombre del músico, de 52 años, por agresión sexual y sufrimiento intencionado, y a las dos discográficas, por negligencia y complicidad en la conducta de su representado.
Doe y otra groupie también menor aguardaron, junto a otros fans del músico, ante el autobús de la gira de Manson tras un concierto en Dallas en 1995. Querían conocer al artista, y este las invitó a subir al vehículo, donde les preguntó su edad y el curso escolar en el que estaban, y tomó nota de sus direcciones y números de teléfono.
“Mientras se encontraba en el autobús de la gira, el acusado Warner cometió varios actos de conducta sexual delictiva sobre la demandante, que era virgen en ese momento, incluyendo, entre otros, cópula forzada y penetración vaginal”, dice el texto de la demanda. La edad de consentimiento en Texas en ese momento era, y sigue siendo, 17 años. “Uno de los miembros de la banda vio al acusado Warner agredir sexualmente a la demandante. La demandante estaba dolorida, asustada, disgustada, humillada y confusa. Cuando terminó, el acusado Warner se rio de ella y exigió a la demandante que ‘se largara de mi autobús’ y la amenazó con que, si se lo contaba a alguien, la mataría a ella y a su familia”.
Según se lee en el texto de la demanda, “la demandante, Jane Doe, es una superviviente de abusos sexuales en la infancia y en la edad adulta, [de] agresión sexual, asalto y abuso sexual a manos del demandado Brian Warner, conocido con el nombre artístico de Marilyn Manson. Las obsesiones pedófilas y los comportamientos violentos del demandado Warner no sólo eran conocidos por los demandados Interscope y Nothing Records, sino que eran celebrados y promovidos para su beneficio económico colectivo”.
La demanda sostiene que Manson se prevalió de “su papel, estatus y poder como adulto e intérprete en la industria de la música” para acceder a la chica, engatusarla, manipularla y explotarla para satisfacer sus deseos, lo que dio lugar “a dos agresiones sexuales en dos incidentes distintos”. Cuatro años después, en 1999, cuando Doe tenía 19 años, “el acusado perpetuó su conducta inapropiada durante al menos cuatro semanas”. Todo ello, con el conocimiento de las discográficas, “conscientes de las prácticas del demandado, y que ayudaron e instigaron tal comportamiento”. Como resultado, la mujer ha sufrido graves daños emocionales, físicos y psicológicos, incluyendo “vergüenza y culpa, pérdida de capacidad económica y estrés emocional”, que derivaron en el consumo y abuso de drogas.
La complicidad de las discográficas es indudable según el texto de la demanda. “A sabiendas, intencional, voluntaria, deliberada e imprudentemente, fomentaron un ambiente omnipresente y hostil con el propósito de obtener ganancias financieras que ignoraron por completo los derechos y la seguridad de los jóvenes fans de la banda. Como resultado, la demandante ha sufrido y sufrirá el resto de su vida humillación, vergüenza y horror”.
El modus operandi de Manson al pedir las direcciones y teléfonos a sus fans, así como la tortura psicológica a que sometía a sus jóvenes víctimas, parece marca de la casa, a juzgar por el testimonio de otros demandantes anteriores. A comienzos de su carrera, Marilyn Manson pedía al final de los conciertos la dirección a sus escasos seguidores con el objetivo de enviarles fotos y material promocional. El mensaje de la madre de uno de ellos puso a la policía en alerta: “Quiero a mi hijo fuera de su lista de correo. Me he puesto en contacto con la oficina de correos sobre el material pornográfico que están enviando a mi hijo. No quiero que nos envíen nada más. Si recibo algún material más de esta banda iré a mi abogado. Gracias y adiós”. Otra de las demandantes, la modelo Sarah McNeilly, señaló en un explosivo reportaje en Rolling Stone a finales de 2021: “La violencia física fue casi un alivio. La mierda mental por la que te hace pasar, que infecta tu cerebro, solo quieres que se detenga”.
Tras las revelaciones de la revista, en la que varias mujeres narran las supuestas atrocidades a las que las sometía el cantante en una dependencia de su casa en Hollywood denominada “la habitación de las chicas malas”, la policía registró su domicilio en busca de pruebas. A las denuncias de particulares se sumaron las de tres exparejas de Manson, si bien su exesposa Dita Von Teese señaló que el comportamiento descrito por las supuestas víctimas no se correspondía en absoluto con el del Manson que ella conoció, y con el que estuvo seis años. No obstante, “el miedo es algo que inculco en otras personas, sobre todo en chicas jóvenes”, admitió en 2009 el músico, cuya carrera musical vive sus horas más bajas con independencia de los escándalos provocados por su conducta perturbadora.

Marilyn Manson being sued for alleged sexual assault of a minor,"Marilyn Manson has been sued by an anonymous woman, who alleges that the shock rock singer groomed and sexually assaulted her numerous times in the 90s when she was underage.
This new lawsuit comes just days after Manson reached a settlement with Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco in her sex abuse lawsuit against him.
The latest court documents list Manson – real name Brian Warner – as a defendant, alongside his former music labels Interscope and Nothing Labels, according to Rolling Stone.
Filed in Nassau County Supreme Court in New York, the legal filing is said to include counts of sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence, among other charges against Warner.
Submitted anonymously by the now-adult woman “Jane Doe”, she wrote that she was 16 when she first met Warner in 1995 after a Dallas concert.
She and a group of other people had been waiting outside Warner’s tour bus to meet him when she claims he invited her “and one of the other younger girls” onto the bus.
She alleges he asked them their age, grade in school and wrote down their phone numbers and home addresses.
“While on the tour bus, Defendant Warner performed various acts of criminal sexual conduct upon Plaintiff, who was a virgin at the time, including but not limited to forced copulation and vaginal penetration,” the lawsuit reads.
It continued: “One of the band members watched Defendant Warner sexually assault Plaintiff.
“Plaintiff was in pain, scared, upset, humiliated and confused. After he was done, Defendant Warner laughed at her. … Then Defendant Warner demanded Plaintiff to ‘get the f*** off of my bus’ and threatened Plaintiff that, if she told anyone, he would kill her and her family.”
Video of the Day
Before she left, Doe claims a crew member gave her a number for the band and a password so she could meet with Warner again.
The suit then says that, shortly after the alleged sexual assault, Doe began using alcohol and drugs and continued to abuse substances in the years following.
It goes on to detail further accounts of Warner’s alleged sexual abuse towards her when she was 16.
Doe claims that she and Warner stayed in contact and that, when she turned 19, the singer invited her on tour where she alleges he continued to “groom, harass, and sexually abuse” her for approximately a month.
Warner’s record labels are also named in the filings, with Doe claiming that they “were well-aware of Defendant Warner’s practice of sexually assaulting minors, and aided and abetted such behaviour”.
“As a result of Brian Warner’s sexual abuse and assault, enabled and encouraged by Defendants Interscope and Nothing Records, Plaintiff has suffered severe emotional, physical, and psychological distress, including shame, and guilt, economic loss, economic capacity and emotional loss,” the lawsuit adds.
In a statement to The Independent, the singer’s attorney Howard King responded to the latest lawsuit, saying Warner “does not know this individual and has no recollection of ever having met her 28 years ago”.
“He certainly was never intimate with her. She has been shopping her fabricated tale to tabloids and on podcasts for more than two years. But even the most minimal amount of scrutiny reveals the obvious discrepancies in her ever-shifting stories as well as her extensive collusion with other false accusers,” King added.
“Brian will not submit to this shakedown – and the courts won’t fall for it either.”
Earlier this month, on January 24, Warner reached a settlement with Bianco in her lawsuit against him, in which she accused him of emotional, sexual and physical abuse.
The 54-year-old “Tainted Love” singer continues to face a string of sexual abuse allegations and lawsuits from women and former partners, including his former fiancée, Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood, who he’s since countersued.
He’s since dismissed all of Wood’s accusations as “horrible distortions of reality” and categorically denied similar allegations in the past.",2023-01-31T00:00:00Z,https://www.independent.ie,Independent.ie
Marilyn Manson acusado de violar fã de 16 anos,"Marilyn Manson enfrenta novas acusações relacionadas com crimes sexuais. Esta segunda-feira, 30 de janeiro, foi apresentado um novo processo no qual surgem acusações de ""abuso sexual de menores"".
Em causa está a acusação de que Marilyn Manson, cujo verdadeiro nome é Brian Hugh Warner, terá violado uma jovem fã de apenas 16 anos.
O crime terá ocorrido após um concerto em Dallas, no Texas, em 1995.
""Um dos membros da banda assistiu à violação. A queixosa ficou magoada, assustada, humilhada e confusa. No final, o réu expulsou-a do autocarro e disse que, se ela contasse a alguém o que tinha acontecido, a matava a ela e à sua família"", cita a revista Rolling Stone, referindo que a jovem era virgem na altura em que aceitou entrar na carrinha da digressão do cantor.
Marilyn Manson é ainda acusado de ter mantido contacto com a jovem, praticando novos abusos, manipulando-a e pressionando-a, fazendo com que se tivesse afastado da família e fornecendo-lhe drogas e álcool, marcando para sempre a sua vida enquanto ""sobrevivente de abuso sexual na infância e na idade adulta"".
Ao contrário das outras acusações de natureza sexual que enfrenta, estes crimes ocorreram no início da carreira de Marilyn Manson (que em 1995 tinha 26 anos).
No processo são ainda visadas as editoras que representavam Manson na época - a Interscope e a Nothing Records. Ambas estão acusadas de não terem agido de forma a impedir as ""obsessões pedófilas e comportamentos violentos"" das quais tinham conhecimento.
O músico, atualmente com 53 anos, já estava a ser investigado devido a denuncias de alegados crimes sexuais e de violência ocorridos entre 2009 e 2011.

Marilyn Manson Sued Over Allegations of Sexual Assault of a Minor,"[Trigger warning: this article contains descriptions of domestic violence, as well as sexual and physical abuse.]
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
Marilyn Manson is the subject of a new lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct. The suit by the woman — identified anonymously as “Jane Doe” in the filing — alleges that the singer, now 54, groomed and sexually assaulted the then-underage girl during the early portion of his career.
Manson (born Brian Warner) is named as a defendant in the suit filed in Nassau County Supreme Court in Long Island, New York, alongside former labels Interscope and Nothing Records in a filing that includes accusations of sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the singer, and negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the labels.
The suit says Doe, then 16, first met Manson in 1995 after a show in Dallas when she waited outside his tour bus and the singer invited her and “one of the other younger girls” onto his tour bus where he allegedly asked for their ages and school grades while jotting down their phone numbers and addresses.
A spokesperson for Manson and the singer’s lawyer had not returned a request for comment on the Doe lawsuit at press time, and a spokesperson for Interscope/Universal Music Group had not yet responded to a request for comment.
“While on the tour bus, Defendant Warner performed various acts of criminal sexual conduct upon Plaintiff, who was a virgin at the time, including but not limited to forced copulation and vaginal penetration,” the lawsuit claims. At the time, the age of consent in Texas was (and still is) 17 and the suit notes that one of Manson’s band members watched “Defendant Warner sexually assault Plaintiff… Plaintiff was in pain, scared, upset, humiliated and confused. After he was done, Defendant Warner laughed at her. … Then Defendant Warner demanded Plaintiff to ‘get the f–k off of my bus’ and threatened Plaintiff that, if she told anyone, he would kill her and her family.”
More than a dozen women have accused Manson of sexual, emotional and physical assault, including actress Evan Rachel Wood, who was the subject of the two-part HBO documentary Phoenix Rising last year that delved into her claims of the abuse she claims she allegedly suffered at the rocker’s hand during an on-and-off relationship that began when she was 18.
Manson and one of his accusers, actress Esme Bianco, recently reached a settlement to end her sexual assault lawsuit, and earlier in the month a judge dismissed another sexual abuse suit from model Ashley Morgan Smithline over her failure to find a new lawyer. Last May, an L.A. Superior Court judge dismissed a suit against Manson filed by a former personal assistant alleging sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Manson has denied the allegations.
The new Jane Doe lawsuit alleges that a member of Manson’s crew gave her a 1-800 number and a password so she could meet up with the singer again, noting that the teen began using drugs and alcohol soon after the alleged sexual assault, and continued to do so for years after. The suit also alleges that Manson would call and chat online with the teen while asking her for explicit photos of her and her friends.
In the same year they met, Doe claims that Manson convinced the teen to meet him in New Orleans, where he “groomed” her by complimenting her artwork before he became more “aggressive and again sexually assaulted Plaintiff, including kissing, biting her breast, oral copulation, and penetration,” the complaint alleges. “After the second assault, Defendant Warner acted in a kinder manner nicer to Plaintiff and told her that he wanted to see her again.” As with Texas, the age of consent in Louisiana at the time was, and is, 17.
Doe said she continued to be in touch with Manson and his band, and when she was 18 moved to Los Angeles and began dating then-Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna. (Billboard has reached out to Vrenna for comment.) In 1999, she allegedly attended a Manson show in New Orleans, describing a typical backstage scene that included “the availability of large amounts of drugs for her and others to use.” The suit claims that the woman then spent the next month on the road with Manson, taking drugs and spending time with the disgraced singer during which he would “groom, harass and sexually abuse” her.
The suit goes on to describe Manson’s increasing psychological control over Doe, in which he allegedly “purposefully and intentionally laid the groundwork necessary to intimidate and control her … As he did on countless occasions, Defendant Warner exploited this vulnerability to keep Plaintiff under his control. Defendant Warner often made Plaintiff feel alone and isolated by telling her that no one understands her other than him, which included her family. At the time, Plaintiff believed Defendant Warner and was compelled to keep following him.”
The suit claims the alleged controlling and grooming behavior continued — including “coerce[ing] Plaintiff to have sex with him and other band members or his assistant at the same time,” while “providing Plaintiff with drugs.”
In details that bear a resemblance to allegations from a number of the other women who’ve accused Manson of abuse, Doe’s lawsuit claims that the singer employed “hostile and verbally abusive behavior,” as well as racially charged language mixed with the sharing of intimate personal details. The suit also claims that Interscope and Nothing Records “were well-aware of Defendant Warner’s obsession with sexual violence and childhood sexual assault,” and that the labels did not have a “reasonable system or procedure in place to investigate, supervise, or monitor its staff and/or agents, including Defendant Warner, to prevent pre-sexual grooming and sexual harassment, molestation, and assault of fans, including minors and women.”
The suit continues, “As a result of Brian Warner’s sexual abuse and assault, enabled and encouraged by Defendants Interscope and Nothing Records, Plaintiff has suffered severe emotional, physical, and psychological distress, including shame, and guilt, economic loss, economic capacity and emotional loss.”
Doe is seeking damages to be determined at trial and an order “enjoining Defendants from future unlawful business practices including, but not limited to, exposing minors and vulnerable adults to sexual abuse and exploitation.”

Marilyn Manson foi acusado de estuprar uma adolescente de 16 anos em 1995. A mulher, que preferiu não se identificar, entrou com uma ação nesta segunda-feira, 30, no condado de Nassau, em Nova York, nos EUA.
Créditos: Reprodução/Instagram Marilyn Manson é acusado de ter estuprado adolescente em 1995
Ela também diz na ação que as gravadoras Interscope e Nothing Records “sabiam ou deveriam saber que ele tinha um histórico de drogar e levar fãs ao backstage, aos ônibus e aos quartos de hotel, e abusar sexualmente de menores e de mulheres”.
O cantor passa por uma série de acusações de estupro nos últimos anos, pelas atrizes Esme Bianco, Evan Rachel Wood e outras quatro mulheres. Ele nega todas as acusações.
Na acusação feita nesta segunda-feira, 30, divulgada pela revista “Rolling Stone” e pelo tabloide “New York Post”, ela diz que foi abusada sexualmente pela primeira vez quando ele a convidou para entrar em um ônibus de turnê em Dallas, em setembro de 1995, quando ela tinha 15 anos.
Depois disso, Manson teria dito que se a vítima “contasse algo para alguém, iria matá-la junto com toda sua família”. Em dezembro do meio do ano, ele voltou a estuprá-la em um ônibus de turnê, inclusive morder seus seios, segundo a acusação.
O que a acusante disse?
Ela diz que, nas duas ocasiões, havia pessoas da equipe do cantor nos ônibus. A mulher diz que o rocokeiro lhe deu drogas e ela foi “atraída para o seu mundo sombrio de drogas, álcool, desvios sexuais, abusos e agressões”.
De acordo com ela, o cantor voltou a levá-la em turnê em 1999, quando tinha 19 anos, onde a forçou a fazer sexo com ele e outras pessoas da equipe.
A mulher diz que as gravadoras sabiam que o artista levava menores de idade para os ônibus após os shows e que estavam “bastante cientes de sua obsessão com violência sexual e abuso de menores”.
Os advogados de Manson e das gravadoras foram procurados pelo site “Page Six”, mas não deram nenhuma resposta até o momento.",2023-01-30T21:33:31Z,https://catracalivre.com.br,Catraca Livre - Notícias
Lawsuit accuses Marilyn Manson of sexually assaulting underage girl multiple times,"Musician Marilyn Manson is facing more allegations of sexual misconduct, accused in a lawsuit filed on Monday of sexually assaulting an underage girl multiple times in the 1990s.
The woman in the lawsuit, who is filing under the name Jane Doe, says in her complaint that Manson started to “target” her in 1995, when she was 16, using his “role, status, and power as an adult and performer in the music industry to gain access to, groom, manipulate and exploit” her. This targeting ultimately resulted in two separate incidents of sexual assault, the complaint alleges.
The complaint says that the first incident took place on Manson’s tour bus after a concert in September 1995 when he “took” the plaintiff and another young girl onto his bus. The complaint states that Manson performed multiple acts of “criminal sexual conduct” on the plaintiff and later contacted her at her home and asked her to send explicit photos of her and her friends to his fan club.
Later that year, the complaint alleges, Manson sexually assaulted her again on a separate occasion on his tour bus after a show.
The complaint also states that in 1999, when the woman was 19, Manson “perpetuated his grooming, manipulation, exploitation and sexual assault” of her for a period of four weeks.
The Hill has reached out to Manson’s representatives for comment.
Manson, who’s real name is Brian Warner, has faced multiple allegations accusing him of sexual harassment and abuse over the years. Earlier this month, he settled a lawsuit with “Game of Thrones” actress Esmé Bianco, who in 2021 accused him of raping her and coercing her to do several sexual acts in 2011.
More than a dozen women have accused Manson of abusive behavior, including actress Evan Rachel Wood, who detailed her allegations in a documentary released last year.
The complaint also lists Manson’s former label companies as defendants in the lawsuit, alleging that they knew that the artist was targeting underage girls and aided him in doing so. The complaint also says the labels “knowingly, intentionally, willfully, deliberately, and recklessly fostered a pervasive and hostile environment for the purpose of financial gain that utterly disregarded the rights and safety of the band’s young fans.”
“Upon information and belief, Defendants Interscope and Nothing Records were ware of Defendant Warner’s practice of sexually assaulting minors, and aided and abetted such behavior,” the complaint states.
“As a result of Brian Warner’s sexual abuse and assault, enabled and encouraged by Defendants Interscope and Nothing Records, Plaintiff has suffered severe emotional, physical and psychological distress, including shame, and guilt, economic loss, economic capacity and emotional loss,” the complaint continues.",2023-01-30T20:59:41Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
Marilyn Manson faces more sex abuse allegations,"In a lawsuit filed on Long Island, New York, on Monday, the singer Marilyn Manson was accused of “childhood and adult sexual abuse, sexual battery, assault and molestation”.
The suit, which alleged Manson first targeted the unnamed plaintiff when she was 16 in 1995, came less than a week after the singer, whose real name is Brian Warner, reached a settlement with the actor Esmé Bianco, who sued him in April 2021, alleging rape and sexual battery.
That suit came amid multiple allegations of abuse from other women, prominently including the actor Evan Rachel Wood.
Manson, through his lawyer, has “vehemently denie[d] any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone”. He also sued Wood for defamation, emotional distress and other claims.
He did not immediately comment on the new suit, which was filed under the New York Adult Survivors Act.
Signed by the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, last May, the act gives alleged victims of sexual assault a window of time in which to sue regardless of when the crime allegedly occurred. Without the act, the claims would be barred from being brought forth by filing deadlines known as statutes of limitation.
The writer E Jean Carroll sued Donald Trump under the act, over her allegation that he raped her in a department store in the mid-1990s, which the former president denies.
The plaintiff in the new suit against Manson is described as “an adult female residing in Maryland”, born in 1979. The suit alleges that Manson “first targeted” the plaintiff “in 1995 when she was 16 years old, using his role, status, and power as an adult and performer in the music industry to gain access to, groom, manipulate and exploit her, resulting in sexual assault in two separate incidents.
“Then, in 1999 when plaintiff was approximately 19 years old, defendant Warner perpetuated his grooming, manipulation, exploitation and sexual assault of plaintiff over the course of approximately four weeks.”
The suit names Nothing Records and its distributor Interscope Music Publishing as co-defendants that were allegedly “aware of” Manson’s “practice of sexually assaulting minors, and aided and abetted such behavior”.
The suit says Manson’s “pedophilic obsessions and violent behaviors were not only known by defendants Interscope and Nothing Records, but they were celebrated and promoted for their collective financial gain”.
One of the plaintiff’s attorneys, Karen Barth Menzies, said the suit was “an indictment of the music industry for maintaining a culture that celebrates, protects and enables sexual predators”.
Interscope and Universal Music, a parent company to the now defunct Nothing label, did not immediately comment.
The suit says the plaintiff “suffered severe emotional, physical and psychological distress, including shame, and guilt, economic loss, economic capacity and emotional loss … humiliation, shame, and horror that she will continue to suffer for the rest of her life”.
It seeks unspecified damages, costs and “an order enjoining defendants from future unlawful business practices including but not limited to exposing minors and vulnerable adults to sexual abuse and exploitation”.
Another attorney for the plaintiff, Jeff Anderson, who has also represented victims of sexual abuse within the Catholic church, said: “For too long, music industry predators have hidden in plain sight, believing they are above the law.
“Today, we are demanding Warner face retribution, so he knows he will no longer escape his day in court. This is a day of reckoning.”",2023-01-30T20:43:24Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
Marilyn Manson: Νέα μήνυση εναντίον του για σεξουαλική επίθεση σε ανήλικη,"Νέα μήνυση κατατέθηκε κατά του Marilyn Manson για σεξουαλική επίθεση σε ανήλικη.
Συγκεκριμένα, ο Marilyn Manson κατηγορείται ότι επιτέθηκε σεξουαλικά σε μία 16χρονη τη δεκαετία του 1990.
Ο μουσικός έχει ήδη κατηγορηθεί από αρκετές γυναίκες, μεταξύ των οποίων και η ηθοποιός του Game Of Thrones, Esmé Bianco και η Evan Rachel Wood, για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση.
Τα περιστατικά φέρεται να συνέβησαν τη δεκαετία του 2010 ωστόσο ο Marilyn Manson αρνείται κατηγορηματικά τις κατηγορίες εναντίον του.
Σύμφωνα με το περιοδικό Rolling Stone, η νέα μήνυση κατατέθηκε με το ψευδώνυμο, Jane Doe και κατονομάζει τον Manson και τις πρώην δισκογραφικές του Interscope και Nothing Records ως κατηγορούμενους.
Σύμφωνα με την καταγγελία, η ανήλικη συνάντησε τον Marilyn Manson μετά από μία συναυλία στο Ντάλας το 1995. Τότε εκείνη ήταν 16 ετών.
Αφού περίμενε στο λεωφορείο της περιοδείας του, εκείνος φέρεται σύμφωνα με την καταγγελία, να κάλεσε εκείνη και μία από τις άλλες νεαρές κοπέλες στο λεωφορείο του. Εκεί φέρεται να τις ρώτησε για τις ηλικίες τους, τους βαθμούς στο σχολείο, τις διευθύνσεις και τα τηλέφωνά τους.
Σύμφωνα με την μήνυση, ο Manson, όπου αναφέρεται με το πραγματικό του όνομα Brian Warner, «προχώρησε σε διάφορες πράξεις εγκληματικής σεξουαλικής συμπεριφοράς κατά της ενάγουσας, η οποία ήταν παρθένα εκείνη την εποχή, συμπεριλαμβανομένης, ενδεικτικά και όχι μόνο, της αναγκαστικής συνουσίας και της κολπικής διείσδυσης».
«Ένα μέλος της μπάντας παρακολουθούσε τον κατηγορούμενο Warner να επιτίθεται σεξουαλικά στην ενάγουσα. Η ενάγουσα πονούσε, ήταν φοβισμένη, αναστατωμένη, ντροπιασμένη και σε σύγχυση. Όταν τελείωσε, ο κατηγορούμενος Warner γέλασε, την έδιωξε από το λεωφορείο και απείλησε ότι αν μιλούσε σε κανέναν για ό,τι συνέβη, θα σκότωνε εκείνη και την οικογένειά της» σύμφωνα με την μήνυση.
Η καταγγέλλουσα ισχυρίζεται ότι ένα μέλος της μπάντας του, της έδωσε έναν αριθμό τηλεφώνου και έναν κωδικό που θα της επέτρεπε να συναντήσει τον Marilyn Manson ξανά.
Ο τραγουδιστής θα μπορούσε να την καλεί σε αυτόν τον αριθμό και να της ζητήσει ξεχωριστές φωτογραφίες της ίδιας και των φίλων της.
Οι σεξουαλικές επιθέσεις του Marilyn Manson συνεχίστηκαν
Την ίδια χρονιά ο Manson φέρεται να έπεισε την καταγγέλλουσα να πάει σε συναυλία του στη Νέα Ορλεάνη.
Όπως αναφέρει η μήνυση, όταν εκείνη βρέθηκε εκεί, ο μουσικός της επιτέθηκε ξανά. Η ίδια ήταν ακόμα 16 ετών. Η νόμιμη ηλικία για σεξουαλική συναίνεση στο Τέξας και τη Λουϊζιάνα είναι τα 17 χρόνια.
Όταν εκείνη μετακόμισε στο Λος Άντζελες σε ηλικία 18 ετών, η καταγγέλλουσα πήγε μία ακόμα φορά σε συναυλία του Marilyn Manson και σύμφωνα με την ίδια, δέχτηκε μία πρόσκληση από ένα μέλος του συγκροτήματός της για μία ακόμα συναυλία της μπάντας στο Ντάλας.
Όπως η ίδια ισχυρίστηκε, πήγε σε εκείνη την συναυλία και σε μία ακόμη στην Νέα Ορλεάνη ενώ στη συνέχεια φέρεται να πέρασε έναν μήνα μαζί με τον Marilyn Manson στην περιοδεία του. Εκείνον τον μήνα τον κατηγορεί ότι την παρενόχλησε και την κακοποίησε σεξουαλικά.
«Ο Marylin Manson την ανάγκαζε να κάνει σεξ με μέλη του συγκροτήματος»
Η γυναίκα ισχυρίστηκε ότι συνέχισε να διατηρεί επαφή και να συνοδεύει τον Manson στην περιοδεία του και όταν ήταν 19 ετών, εκείνος «διαιώνισε τη χειραγώγηση, την εκμετάλλευση και τη σεξουαλική του επίθεση κατά της ενάγουσας».
«Σε όλη τη διάρκεια της περιοδείας και ενώ βρισκόταν στην Πολιτεία της Νέας Υόρκης, όταν η ενάγουσα ήταν με τον κατηγορούμενο Warner τόσο τις ημέρες της συναυλίας όσο και τις ημέρες άδειας, ο Warner την ανάγκασε να κάνει σεξ μαζί του», ισχυρίστηκε στη μήνυση, υποστηρίζοντας ότι την ανάγκασε να κάνει σεξ και με τα μέλη του συγκροτήματος και τον βοηθό του.
«Ο Warner ήλεγχε τι μπορούσε να κάνει η ενάγουσα, ποιος μπορούσε να την αγγίξει και με ποιον θα προχωρούσε σεξουαλικά η ενάγουσα. Όλα αυτά παρέχοντάς της ναρκωτικά».
Η Doe ισχυρίστηκε ότι οι δισκογραφικές στις οποίες είχε υπογράψει ο Manson - η Interscope Records και η Nothing Records - «γνώριζαν καλά την εμμονή του κατηγορούμενου Warner με τη σεξουαλική βία και την παιδική σεξουαλική επίθεση» και ότι θα έπρεπε να την είχαν προστατεύσει από εκείνον.
«Ουδέποτε η κατηγορούμενες Interscope και Nothing Records διέθεταν ένα εύλογο σύστημα ή διαδικασία για τη διερεύνηση, την επίβλεψη ή την παρακολούθηση του προσωπικού ή/και των ατζέντηδών της, συμπεριλαμβανομένου του καταγγέλλοντος Warner, για την αποτροπή προσεξουαλικών πράξεων και σεξουαλικής παρενόχλησης, επίθεσης, μεταξύ αυτών σε ανήλικες και ενήλικες γυανίκες», υποστηρίζει η μήνυση.
Σύμφωνα με την μήνυση, η φερόμενη κακοποίηση που υπέστη προκάλεσε στην Doe «σοβαρή συναισθηματική, σωματική και ψυχολογική δυσφορία, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της ντροπής και της ενοχής, της οικονομικής και συναισθηματικής ζημιάς».
Η καταγγέλλουσα ζητά αποζημίωση και «διαταγή απαγόρευσης των κατηγορουμένων από μελλοντικές παράνομες επιχειρηματικές πρακτικές, συμπεριλαμβανομένων, ενδεικτικά, της έκθεσης ανηλίκων και ευάλωτων ενηλίκων σε σεξουαλική κακοποίηση και εκμετάλλευση».
Η Nothing Records σταμάτησε να λειτουργεί το 2004. Ιδρύθηκε από τον Trent Reznor των Nine Inch Nails.
Η πλευρά Manson δεν έχει σχολιάσει τη νέα μήνυση αλλά έχει αρνηθεί σθεναρά όλες τις προηγούμενες καταγγελίες για σεξουαλική παρενόχληση, επίθεση και κακοποίηση, που έχουν γίνει εναντίον του.

Marilyn Manson Sued By Woman Who Claims Singer Sexually Assaulted Her When She Was A Minor,"Marilyn Manson is facing a lawsuit filed by a woman who claims that the singer sexually assaulted her in 1995, when she was 16, and later when she was an adult.
The lawsuit, filed in New York Supreme Court on Monday (read it here), comes a week after a settlement was reached in a lawsuit brought by Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco, who had filed suit claiming that Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, sexually assaulted her.
The New York lawsuit was filed by a Jane Doe, which her attorneys wrote that they used to protect the woman’s privacy as a victim of sexual assault. The lawsuit also names as defendants Interscope Music Publishing and Nothing Records, accused of being aware of Manson’s conduct.
“As a result of Brian Warner’s sexual abuse and assault, enabled and encouraged by Defendants Interscope and Nothing Records, Plaintiff has suffered severe emotional, physical and psychological distress, including shame, and guilt, economic loss, economic capacity and emotional loss,” the lawsuit states.
Manson’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to the lawsuit, Jane Doe was 16 when she met Manson at a concert. He invited her and other girls on his tour bus. Then, he “performed various acts of criminal sexual conduct upon Plaintiff, who was a virgin at the time, including but not limited to forced copulation and vaginal penetration. One of the band members watched Defendant Warner sexually assault Plaintiff. Plaintiff was in pain, scared, upset, humiliated and confused,” according to the lawsuit.
Then, after he was done, according to the suit, Manson allegedly “laughed at her. Plaintiff is informed and thereon alleges that all of the sexually abusive and harassing conduct alleged herein was done to satisfy Defendant Warner’s own prurient sexual desires. Then Defendant Warner demanded Plaintiff to ‘get the f— off of my bus’ and threatened Plaintiff that, if she told anyone, he would kill her and her
family.”
Jane Doe then claims that Manson’s tour manager gave her a 1-800 number to stay in touch with the band and a 1-800 number to have special access with the group. She rushed off the bus, “convinced she must keep her mouth shut or Defendant Warner would kill her and her family.”
Afraid to tell anyone what happened she then started using drugs for the first time, the start of a longtime addiction, according to the lawsuit. Manson then started to contact her at home, “soliciting
Plaintiff to send explicit sexual photos of her and her friends to his fan club, Satan’s Bakesale.
Defendant Warner also began communicating with Plaintiff directly through an Internet chat
group.”
According to the lawsuit, “acting on the encouragement and insistence” of Manson, she went to another show, this one in New Orleans. He again took her on the tour bus and “groomed” her by “complimenting her, playing with her hair and looking at the photos and drawings she brought with her.” She then experienced a second sexual assault.
“Another man involved with the tour was on the bus at the time Defendant Warner sexually assaulted Plaintiff. Upon information and belief this man was an employee of Defendants. After the second assault,
Defendant Warner acted in a kinder manner nicer to Plaintiff and told her that he wanted to see
her again,” according to the lawsuit.
As she got older, Jane Doe continued her interest in the music scene, and was put in touch with Chris Vrenna, drummer of Trent Reznor’s band Nine Inch Nails, and they began dating.
When she was 19 and addicted to drugs and alcohol, she was lured into Manson’s “dark world,” again attending his concerts, as she was made to feel “special and chosen” by the singer. Over the course of four weeks, according to the lawsuit, Manson would supply drugs to her and also continue to “groom, harass and sexually abuse” her. The lawsuit claims that Manson “intended effect was to exert control over Plaintiff for his own sexual gratification.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction prohibiting the defendants “from future unlawful business practices including, but not limited to exposing minors and vulnerable adults to sexual abuse and exploitation.”
Rolling Stone first reported on the litigation.

Marilyn Manson anklaget for seksuelt overgrep av mindreårig
En kvinne anklager Marilyn Manson for å ha seksuelt forgrepet seg på henne flere ganger på 1990-tallet – blant annet da hun var 16 år. Kvinnen har også saksøkt plateselskapene hans.
Det melder Rolling Stone.
Marilyn Manson, eller Brian Warner som er hans opprinnelige navn, har tidigere måttet tåle harde angrep og beskyldninger om mishandling overfor blant andre sin egen eksforlovede Evan Rachel Wood og artisten/kunstneren Illma Gore.
Den velkjente artisten har hele veien nektet for beskyldningene og har kalt dem «en uhyrlig forvrenging av virkeligheten».
Nå anklages Manson for å ha forgrepet seg seksuelt på en kvinne flere ganger på 1990-tallet. Hun skal på tidspunktet ha vært 16 år gammel.
Det fremkommer i et søksmål som er levert inn av en anonym kvinne til Nassau County Supreme Court på Long Island i New York.
Søksmålet er vedlagt i artikkelen til Rolling Stone. Der fremkommer det at kvinnen er anonymisert for hennes egen beskyttelse.
Manson har foreløpig ikke kommentert søksmålet. Variety skriver at de har forsøkt å få kommentar fra artisten.
En vesentlig del av søksmålet er at kvinnen hevder at Mansons plateselskaper Interscope Records og Nothing Records, «var godt klar over» Mansons «besettelse av seksuell vold og seksuelle overgrep».
Kvinnen mener at selskapene burde ha beskyttet henne.
– Dette søksmålet går lengre enn den navngitte overgriperen og retter seg mot plateselskapene som profitterer på artisters kriminelle oppførsel, sier kvinnens advokat, Jeff Anderson, til Rolling Stone.
Representanter for Interscope og dets morselskap Universal Music Group har foreløpig ikke kommentert søksmålet, skriver Rolling Stone.
Beskriver flere hendelser
Søksmålet baserer seg på flere hendelser som angivelig fant sted i begynnelsen av Mansons karriere på 1990-tallet.
I søksmålet anklager kvinnen Manson for å ha forgrepet seg seksuelt på henne to ganger da hun var 16 år gammel.
Kvinnen hevder at det første overgrepet skjedde da hun møtte Manson i 1995 etter en konsert i Dallas. Det hevdes også at et av bandmedlemmene observerte det angivelige overgrepet.
Saksøker skal senere holdt kontakten med Manson, og hevder at da hun var 18 år at hun tilbrakte fire uker med Manson og bandet hans, at det var involvert mye narkotika – og at hun igjen gjentatte ganger ble seksuelt misbrukt av Manson.
Kvinnen mener også at hun over lengre tid ble utsatt for psykologisk manipulasjon av Manson, og Rolling Stone skriver at Manson ifølge søksmålet skal ha truet kvinnen med at hvis hun fortalte det til noen «ville han drepe henne og familien hennes.».
Anklager fra over tolv kvinner
De siste to årene har over tolv kvinner kommet med alvorlige anklager mot Manson, ifølge Rolling Stone. Magasinet har fulgt sakene tett.
I mai 2021 saksøkte skuespilleren Esmé Bianco Manson for seksuell-, fysisk og emosjonell mishandling. Rolling Stone skriver at Bianco og Manson inngikk forlik i forrige uke.
Mansons tidligere assistent, Ashley Walters, og modell Ashley Morgan Smithline er også blant saksøkerne. Walters søksmål ble avvist på grunn av foreldelsesfristen, mens Smithlines søksmål ble tilbakevist da hun gikk glipp av en viktig frist.
En fjerde sak fra en annen anonym kvinne, som påstår at Manson voldtok henne i 2011 hjemmet hans, pågår ennå.
En etterforskning av påstått kriminelt overgrep utført av Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department om Warner ble avsluttet i fjor høst. D. A.s kontor har foreløpig ikke kommentert utfallet av etterforskningen.

Marilyn Manson accused of sexual assault of a minor in new lawsuit,"In a new lawsuit, an anonymous woman has accused rocker Brian Warner, better known by the stage name Marilyn Manson, of grooming her and sexually assaulting her multiple times in the 1990s when she was underage.
The woman, identified as “Jane Doe,” submitted the suit in Nassau County Supreme Court on Long Island, with Warner and his former labels Interscope and Nothing Records listed as defendants, according to Rolling Stone. In the suit, the plaintiff accuses Warner of sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress and accuses the labels of negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

This Jane Doe says she met Warner after a concert in Dallas in 1995, when she was 16 years old, below the age of consent in Texas. She alleges Warner invited her and a younger girl onto his tour bus, asked them for their ages and school grades, and made a note of their home addresses and phone numbers.
“While on the tour bus, Defendant Warner performed various acts of criminal sexual conduct upon Plaintiff, who was a virgin at the time, including but not limited to forced copulation and vaginal penetration,” the lawsuit reads. “One of the band members watched Defendant Warner sexually assault Plaintiff. Plaintiff was in pain, scared, upset, humiliated, and confused. After he was done, Defendant Warner laughed at her. … Then Defendant Warner demanded Plaintiff to ‘get the f--k off of my bus’ and threatened Plaintiff that, if she told anyone, he would kill her and her family.”

Afterward, Warner allegedly contacted the plaintiff to ask for explicit photos of her and her friends. Then, he allegedly persuaded the plaintiff, still 16 at the time, to meet him in New Orleans — where the age of consent is 17 — and allegedly groomed her by complimenting her artwork.
“Defendant Warner then became more aggressive and again sexually assaulted Plaintiff, including kissing, biting her breast, oral copulation, and penetration,” the suit reads.
After the Jane Doe turned 18, Warner allegedly continued to “groom, harass, and sexually abuse” her, according to the lawsuit. “While she was still a child, Defendant Warner had purposefully and intentionally laid the groundwork necessary to intimidate and control her,” the complaint adds.
Now the alleged victim is seeking damages to be determined at trial, as well as an “order enjoining Defendants from future unlawful business practices including, but not limited to, exposing minors and vulnerable adults to sexual abuse and exploitation.”
More than a dozen women have made accusations against Warner — including his ex-fiancé, actress Evan Rachel Wood. “He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” Wood wrote on Instagram in February 2021. “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.”
When Rolling Stone covered the many accusations of abuse against Warner in an investigation published in November 2021, an attorney for Warner said the musician “vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone.”",2023-01-30T17:39:14Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News
"Marilyn Manson accused of sexually assaulting girl, 16","Marilyn Manson sexually assaulted a 16-year-old in his tour bus and threatened to kill her family if she spoke out, a new lawsuit alleges.
A woman – who filed suit anonymously under the name Jane Doe – claims the shock rocker sexually assaulted and raped her many times from 1995 through 1999, beginning a few days after her 16th birthday on Sept. 15, 1995, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in New York’s Nassau County Supreme Court.
The now 44-year-old accuser also mounted claims against Manson’s record labels Interscope Music and Nothing Records – that latter founded by Nine Inch Nails rocker Trent Reznor – claiming they promoted and profited off of Manson’s sexual deviance, including an apparent penchant for pedophilia, the filing claims.
The labels “were well aware of [Manson’s] obsession with child pornography and pedophilia and his desire to expose children across America to sexual themes,” the suit charges. And the labels promoted this, “for added publicity and financial gain,” the court papers allege.

Doe – who was from Maryland at the time – says after the show she and a group of other young girls waited outside Manson’s tour bus but he only invited Doe and another girl in. She claims he asked them detailed questions about their ages, where their parents were and even jotted down their phone numbers and addresses.
Then while on the bus, Manson – whose real name is Brian Warner – “performed various acts of criminal sexual conduct upon Plaintiff, who was a virgin at the time, including but not limited to forced copulation and vaginal penetration,” all while another bandmate was watching, the filing alleges.
When Manson, 54, was done he told her to “get the f–k off of my bus” before threatening to kill her family if she spoke about what happened, the court papers claim.

Doe, “was in pain, scared, upset, humiliated and confused” and soon after the incident developed a drug and alcohol addiction, the suit claims.
Weeks later Manson, contacted her at her home asking her to send racy photos of herself and her friends to his fan club Satan’s Bakesale, the suit claims. And he spoke to her through an internet chat group getting her to come to another performance in New Orleans, Louisiana on Dec. 9, 1995, the court papers say.
There Manson, “groomed Plaintiff by complimenting her, playing with her hair and looking at the photos and drawings she brought with her,” before again sexually assaulting her, the suit claims.
Manson claimed in an Instagram post from 2021 that all his sexual encounters were always consensual.
Doe claims she was also sexually assaulted by Manson many times over the course of a month while he was on tour, years later in 1999 when she was 19-years-old, according to the suit.
Manson was engaged to “Charmed” actress Rose McGowan from 1997 to 2001.
“Plaintiff was lured into Defendants’ dark world of drugs, alcohol, sexual deviance, harassment, abuse and assault,” the suit charges.
During this period, Manson and “his associates” gave her drugs and alcohol and he was able to continue his abuse of her as an adult because of his prior grooming of her when she was still a minor, the suit claims.
“[Manson] coerced her to have sex with him. [Manson] often coerced Plaintiff to have sex with him and other band members or his assistant at the same time,” court papers charge.
During this time, she claims Manson was very controlling of her and it even turned “hostile and verbally abusive,” the suit claims.

In 2021, women began coming forward with allegations of abuse against Manson, prompting Doe to come forward online. She says that Manson retaliated against her including by revealing sensitive information about her, hacking her online accounts and harassing her through various websites, the court papers allege.
Doe is suing for unspecified damages.
“Brian Warner and his promoters are now held to answer for decades of decadence, violence, predation, and intimidation,” Doe’s lawyer Jeff Andersen said in a statement.
Reps for Manson and Universal Music Group – the parent company of Interscope and Nothing Records – didn’t immediately return requests for comment.
But in an Instagram post from 2021 Manson said: “My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners.”

Marilyn Manson sued for allegedly sexually assaulting teen girl,"Marilyn Manson allegedly groomed and repeatedly sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl in the ’90s, according to a bombshell new lawsuit.
The shock rocker allegedly first attacked the girl — named as Jane Doe in the suit, filed Monday in Nassau County Supreme Court and seen by Page Six — after inviting her on his tour bus following a Dallas show in September 1995 and then threatened that “if she told anyone, he would kill her and her family.”
The filing alleges that Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, “within weeks” began calling the girl and asking her “to send explicit sexual photos of her and her friends to his fan club, Satan’s Bakesale.”
Manson, now 54, then invited her to a December 1995 show in New Orleans, where, the lawsuit claims, he took her back on his tour bus and “became more aggressive and again sexually assaulted [her], including kissing, biting her breast, oral copulation and penetration.”
On both occasions, there were allegedly other members of Manson’s entourage on the bus.

The victim alleges that she then became addicted to drugs and alcohol and was “lured into [Manson’s] dark world of drugs, alcohol, sexual deviance, harassment, abuse and assault.”
Then in 1999, when she was 19, she was invited on tour with Manson, where he “continued to groom and sexually assault [her] for the next 4 weeks,” the suit claims, adding, “[Manson] often coerced Plaintiff to have sex with him and other band members or his assistant at the same time. [Manson] controlled what Plaintiff could do, who could touch Plaintiff, and who he wanted Plaintiff to be with sexually, all while providing Plaintiff with drugs.”
The lawsuit also names Manson’s labels, Interscope and Nothing Records, claiming they “knew or should have known that [Manson] had a history of giving drugs to female fans he allowed backstage, onto the bus and in hotel rooms, and sexually assaulting minors and women.”
It adds that the labels knew the performer was inviting minors onto his bus after shows and “were well-aware of [his] obsession with sexual violence and childhood sexual assault.”

Doe’s attorney, Karen Barth Menzies, tells Page Six, “Sexual predators in the music industry don’t act alone. It takes a network of people to aid and protect the artists who commit these heinous acts.
“In order for there to be meaningful changes in the music industry, we have to do more than just hold the predators accountable. We have to force the record companies to acknowledge the crimes they allow to occur, and in some instances facilitate, and we have to force them to take responsibility for permitting and profiting from outrageous criminal behavior.”
Doe is seeking damages to be determined at trial and an order preventing Manson and his labels from “exposing minors and vulnerable adults to sexual abuse and exploitation.”
Manson’s attorney, Howard King, and representatives from Interscope and Nothing Records didn’t immediately get back to us.
Former assistant Ashley Walters and actress Esmé Bianco previously accused Manson of misconduct. Instagram
This is the first suit with allegations of sex crimes from the early days of Manson’s career, and it comes just a week after he and “Game of Thrones” actress Esmé Bianco agreed to settle the lawsuit she filed against him in 2021.
Bianco, who played Ros in the hit HBO series, had claimed Manson drugged, tortured and sexually assaulted her.
She alleged that when the metal singer asked her to appear in his 2009 video for “I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies,” she was given drugs and alcohol and that he electrocuted her and beat her with a whip that he said was “utilized by the Nazis.”
Bianco’s suit also claimed Manson once chased her with an axe and allegedly cut her “with a Nazi knife during sex, without her consent, and photographed the cuts on her body.”
Her complaint also alleged Manson continued to sexually assault her in 2011: “These acts include spanking, biting, cutting and whipping Ms. Bianco’s buttocks, breasts and genitals for Mr. Warner’s sexual gratification — all without the consent of Plaintiff.”

Manson strongly denied the claims. The terms of the settlement, which was reached out of court, are not known.
Bianco was one of more than a dozen women who came forward with allegations of sexual abuse against Manson after actress Evan Rachel Wood claimed on Instagram in 2021 that he had abused her, which he said was untrue. Manson sued Wood for defamation, but she stood by her claims, saying, “I have the truth on my side.”
Bianco, 40, and Wood, 35, co-created the Phoenix Act, which expands the rights for survivors of domestic violence to file legal claims.
Manson has said in a court declaration, “I understand that on or around February 1, 2021, [Evan Rachel] Wood posted to Instagram that I was her abuser, and shortly thereafter a number of other women simultaneously emerged with false public accusations against me of abuse, assault, rape, threats, trafficking and the like.
“These women include Ashley Morgan Smithline, Ashley Walters, Jane Doe, and Esme Bianco. To the extent I had relationships with these women, those relationships were consensual.”
He continued, “I never abused, assaulted, raped, threatened, or trafficked any of these women, as they contend. Their accusations against me of abuse, assault, rape, threats, and the like are unequivocally false.”

Earlier this month, a judge threw out the lawsuit filed against Manson by Smithline, who had previously accused him of raping and abusing her during their two-year, on-and-off relationship.
Smithline had been asked to find a new lawyer after her former counsel withdrew from her case, but the model failed to retain representation, so her suit was dismissed without prejudice, which means she could refile it in the future.
The abuse lawsuit filed against Manson by his former assistant Walters was dismissed by a Los Angeles judge in May 2022 on the grounds of the statute of limitations.",2023-01-30T17:06:06Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six

Marilyn Manson is being sued for allegedly grooming and sexually assaulting an underage girl ""multiple times in the 1990s"" at the beginning of his career.
The musician, real name Brian Warner, is named as a defendant in the new lawsuit, alongside his former labels Interscope and Nothing Records.
Now an adult, the alleged victim – who remains anonymous as Jane Doe – claims counts of sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
The labels also face claims of negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress, amongst other allegations by Doe.
Filed at Nassau County Supreme Court in Long Island, New York, documents – originally obtained by Rolling Stone – brand Jane a ""survivor of childhood and adult sexual abuse"".

Doe's attorneys claim Warner's ""paedophilic obsessions and violent behaviours"" were not only ""known by Interscope and Nothing Records"", but they were ""celebrated and promoted for their collective financial gain"".
Brian reportedly first met Doe in 1995 when she was 16-years-old where he allegedly ""used his role, status, and power as an adult and performer in the music industry to gain access to, groom, manipulate and exploit"" her, resulting in alleged ""sexual assault in two separate incidents"".
It is claimed that, in 1999 when Doe was approximately 19-years-old, Warner ""perpetuated his grooming, manipulation, exploitation and sexual assault of her over the course of approximately 4 weeks"".
Within the lawsuit, its claimed that on their first meeting in 1995, Doe was invited onto Warner's tour bus following a gig in Dallas – she was with ""one of the other younger girls"".

It is claimed that Warner asked their age and school grade before taking down their home address and phone numbers.
""While on the tour bus, Defendant Warner performed various acts of criminal sexual conduct upon Plaintiff, who was a virgin at the time, including but not limited to forced copulation and vaginal penetration,"" the lawsuit claims.
It was claimed that ""one of the band members watched Warner sexually assault Doe"".
""Doe was in pain, scared, upset, humiliated and confused. After he was done, Defendant Warner laughed at her. … Then Defendant Warner demanded Plaintiff to 'get the fuck off of my bus' and threatened Plaintiff that, if she told anyone, he would kill her and her family.""
Doe claims that a crew member gave her a 1-800 number for the band and a password so she and Warner could meet again.

Doe claims in the suit that Warner would call her and chat with her online asking for explicit photos of her and her friends.
It was later that year that Doe claims Brian convinced her, still aged 16, to travel to a New Orleans concert before he ""groomed"" her by complimenting her artwork.
""Defendant Warner then became more aggressive and again sexually assaulted Plaintiff, including kissing, biting her breast, oral copulation, and penetration,"" the complaint says.
""After the second assault, Defendant Warner acted in a kinder manner nicer to Plaintiff and told her that he wanted to see her again.""
Doe allegedly continued her contact with Brian and the band and aged 18, while dating then-Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna, they met again.

She attended a Marilyn Manson concert where a band member encouraged her to attend a 1999 Dallas concert. She also went to the next show, in New Orleans, according to the lawsuit.
It was there that a crew member helped her get backstage for an audience with Warner. A member of Warner’s retinue allegedly told her he would continue to give her backstage passes.
The suit claims: ""The atmosphere backstage always included the availability of large amounts of drugs for her and others to use.""
Doe claims she spent the next four weeks on the road with the group, taking drugs and spending hours with Warner in which he’d ""groom, harass, and sexually abuse"" her.

Doe’s attorney Jeff Anderson told Rolling Stone: “This suit by this survivor is a giant step in bringing light and heat to an industry that has been hiding perils in plain sight.
""It’s time to face the music. New laws give survivors the time to take real action for justice and protection. Powerful new laws in New York and California give adult survivors the chance to take legal action against predators and those that protect and profit from them.""

Marilyn Manson Sued for 1990s Sexual Battery of a Minor,"Note: This article includes details of alleged assault that readers may find disturbing.
Marilyn Manson has been sued by a woman who claims that the musician sexually abused her in the 1990s when he was an adult and she was a minor, Rolling Stone reports and Pitchfork can confirm.
The lawsuit was filed in a New York court today (January 30) and also names Interscope Records and Nothing Records (John Malm Jr. and Trent Reznor’s former Interscope subsidiary) as defendants. The woman is identified in the lawsuit as Jane Doe. Formally, the lawsuit accuses Manson of sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and accuses Interscope and Nothing of negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Doe is seeking unspecified damages.
According to the complaint, Jane Doe first met Marilyn Manson (whose real name is Brian Warner) at age 16 after attending his September 15, 1995, concert in Dallas, Texas. She, along with “three other underage female fans,” were apparently waiting outside the venue to meet Manson. The musician allegedly asked the girls “what each of their ages were, what grades in school they were in, and where their parents were at the time,” before inviting Jane Doe “and one of the other younger girls onto the tour bus.”
On the tour bus, according to the lawsuit, “Warner performed various acts of criminal sexual conduct upon Plaintiff [Jane Doe], who was a virgin at the time, including but not limited to forced copulation and vaginal penetration.” The lawsuit continues, “One of the band members watched Defendant Warner sexually assault Plaintiff. Plaintiff was in pain, scared, upset, humiliated and confused. After he was done, Defendant Warner laughed at her. Plaintiff is informed and thereon alleges that all of the sexually abusive and harassing conduct alleged herein was done to satisfy Defendant Warner’s own prurient sexual desires. Then Defendant Warner demanded Plaintiff to ‘get the fuck off of my bus’ and threatened Plaintiff that, if she told anyone, he would kill her and her family.”
Following the alleged assault, Manson’s manager apparently gave Doe a phone number and password to “‘stay in touch’” with Manson and the band. Manson, in turn, allegedly began to call Doe at her home, “soliciting Plaintiff to send explicit sexual photos of her and her friends to his fan club, Satan’s Bakesale.”
On December 9, 1995, after more communication with Manson, Doe allegedly attended his concert in New Orleans and was again brought to the musician’s tour bus after the show. On the bus, the lawsuit states, Manson “groomed Plaintiff by complimenting her, playing with her hair and looking at the photos and drawings she brought with her.” In addition, Manson allegedly sexually assaulted Doe, as did “[a]nother man involved with the tour.”",2023-01-30T16:00:25Z,https://pitchfork.com,Pitchfork
Marilyn Manson encore accusé d’agressions sexuelle,"Marilyn Manson est de nouveau accusé de viol, cette fois-ci d’une jeune femme mineure dans les années 1990.
Le magazine Rolling Stone rapporte qu’une nouvelle plainte a été déposée contre le chanteur, mais que c’est la première fois qu’il est accusé pour des incidents qui seraient survenus au début de sa carrière.
L’identité de la victime est anonyme. Elle poursuit Manson, né Brian Warner, mais aussi les maisons de disques Interscope et Nothing Records.
La jeune fille avait 16 ans quand Manson l’aurait invitée à monter à bord de son autocar de tournée après un spectacle à Dallas, en 1995. Il aurait commis plusieurs agressions à caractère sexuel. Cela ne s’est pas arrêté là : la présumée victime aurait suivi Manson en tournée et les abus se seraient poursuivis avec du contrôle psychologique.
La victime allègue que les maisons de disques Interscope et Nothing Records ont fermé les yeux sur les agissements de Marilyn Manson.
C’est loin d’être la première fois que le chanteur est accusé de crimes de nature sexuelle. Une douzaine de femmes ont dénoncé des gestes qui auraient été commis à leur endroit.
La plainte de la mannequin Ashley Morgan Smithline n’a pas donné lieu à des accusations, alors que celle l’actrice Esmé Bianco s’est conclue par un accord à l’amiable il y a quelques jours.

Marilyn Manson Sued for Sexually Assaulting a Minor,"In the latest in a series of sexual misconduct lawsuits against Marilyn Manson, the singer has been sued by an anonymous woman who claims he groomed and sexually assaulted her multiple times in the 1990s when she was underage, according to a new lawsuit reported by Rolling Stone.
The new lawsuit, the first in which the artist is accused of misconduct early in his career, includes counts of sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and also accuses his record labels, Interscope and Trent Reznor’s Nothing Records, of negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress and other charges.
More than a dozen women have made sexual misconduct allegations against the singer,
whose real name is Brian Warner. The new one makes claims of non-consensual sex acts and threats against the plaintiff and her family, although the woman continued to visit Manson at various tour stops over the following years, including a period of four weeks on tour with the group in which she took drugs with the bandmembers and Warner would “groom, harass, and sexually abuse” her and “intentionally laid the groundwork necessary to intimidate and control her” after she had reached the age of consent.
Among other charges, the plaintiff is suing for intentional infliction of emotional distress, claiming that Warner’s “emotional manipulation” included “hostile and verbally abusive behavior.”
The lawsuit claims that Warner’s record labels “were well-aware of Defendant Warner’s practice of sexually assaulting minors, and aided and abetted such behavior,” the filing claims. “As a result of Brian Warner’s sexual abuse and assault, enabled and encouraged by Defendants Interscope and Nothing Records, Plaintiff has suffered severe emotional, physical, and psychological distress, including shame, and guilt, economic loss, economic capacity and emotional loss.”

Roqueiro Marilyn Manson faz acordo com Esmé Bianco após processo,"Após a atriz Esmé Bianco de “Game of Thrones” processar o cantor Marilyn Manson por abuso e agressão sexual eles fizeram um acordo. O advogado da atriz detalhou ao site Deadline, ""a senhora Bianco concordou em resolver suas reivindicações contra Brian Warner e Marilyn Manson Records"".
Na terça-feira (24) o agente de defesa de Esmé fez uma declaração parecida informando que sua cliente queria “seguir em frente com sua vida e carreira”. Mas não deu detalhes do acordo segundo o portal Terra.
Em fevereiro de 2021 a atriz contou um pouco da experiência que teve com Manson ao New York Magazine, no qual contou sobre uma facada que levou, porém no processo aberto contra o cantor a denúncia estava mais completa sobre as violências.
Foi feito também uma denúncia ao empresário do artista, Tony Ciulla no dia 30 de abril de 2021 no Tribunal Distrital da Califórnia, no qual alegou que o mesmo teria feito tráfico humano, ao levar ela de Londres para Los Angeles alegando que seria para um projeto de um videoclipe e um filme que nunca foram feitos.
Segundo a atriz o contrato foi feito em 2009 com intuito de estrelar no clipe. Porém ao chegar na casa do cantor em Los Angeles, nos Estados Unidos, Bianco se deparou apenas com o roqueiro lhe aguardando apenas com uma câmera. Ele alegou que tudo que fosse gravado seria em prol do vídeo, o artista fez a atriz ficar só de lingierie, ameaçou estupra-la e agredi-la, em seguida amarrou em um movel do quarto onde passou a chicoteá-la e eletrocutá-la.
Nunca foi lançado nada do combinado, e Esmé falou que Manson usou “ameaças, drogas e violência”, para manter a atriz em suas mãos, prometendo para ela até um papel em “Phantasmagoria”, mas nunca ocorreu nada do prometido, a atriz recebeu apenas a lavagem cerebral que o cantor deu pra ela ao fazer ela morar com ele em 2011.
Os detalhes dado por Esmé é de que na época ele obrigava ela ficar dias sem dormir, a xingando em momentos de desconforto enquanto era violentada e estupada frequentemente. Manson até cortou a atriz com uma faca e postou as imagens dos ferimentos nas redes sociais sem o seu consentimento.
Os detetives do Condado de Los Angeles invadiram a residência do roqueiro sobe investigação relacionada a acusações de agressão e estupro. As apurações do caso foi entregues ao cartório em 2022. Porém, não se tem registro se acusação foi feita, apesar do número significativo de reclamações de outras mulheres, incluindo a ex-noiva de Manson, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood.",2023-01-26T22:30:07Z,https://www.otempo.com.br,O Tempo
"Marilyn Manson chega a acordo com atriz de ""Game of Thrones"" por agressões sexuais","O cantor Marilyn Manson fez um acordo judicial com a atriz Esmé Bianco, conhecida pelo papel de Ros em “Game of Thrones, para encerrar o processo de abuso e agressão sexual que ela havia aberto contra ele. A artista havia entrado com uma ação em abril de 2021 e acusou o músico de agressão sexual, estupro e tráfico humano. Os supostos crimes teriam ocorrido em 2011.
Segundo informações do Deadline, a atriz concordou em resolver suas exigências para seguir em frente com sua vida e carreira. Os termos exatos do acordo são desconhecidos. “A Sra. Bianco concordou em resolver suas reivindicações contra Brian Warner (nome real do músico) e Marilyn Manson Records, Inc”, disse o advogado Howard E. King ao portal norte-americano em nome do cantor e sua gravadora.
O advogado de Esmé Bianco também divulgou uma declaração semelhante na terça-feira (24), afirmando que sua cliente queria “seguir em frente com sua vida e carreira”. Os detalhes do acordo estão ocultos, mas claramente pelo menos uma das partes procurou que isso fosse retirado da pauta e fora dos olhos do público.
Esmé falou pela primeira vez sobre o caso em fevereiro de 2021, pouco antes de entrar com o processo. Os dois se conheceram no set de filmagem do filme “Phantasmagoria” e namoraram em 2011. A ação foi aberta em abril de 2021 no Tribunal Distrital da Califórnia, onde a atriz alegou que o cantor havia usado “ofertas fraudulentas de papéis em filmes e videoclipes para convencer a Sra. Bianco de viajar para Los Angeles, após isso, que o Sr. Manson fez atos sobre a Sra. Bianco com os quais ela não consentiu”.
Esmé Bianco disse que Marilyn Manson pediu que ela viesse do Reino Unido para Los Angeles sob o pretexto de trabalhar em um de seus elaborados videoclipes. No entanto, o trabalho e o clipe aparentemente nunca deram certo, mas a atriz alegou que depois de se mudar para o apartamento do roqueiro em West Hollywood em 2011, Manson tentou controlar toda a sua vida. A queixa também denunciava o empresário do artista, Tony Ciulla, por tráfico humano.
“O Sr. Manson estuprou a Sra. Bianco em maio de 2011”, afirma o processo contestado sem sucesso por Esmo. A atriz ainda acrescentou que o cantor não permitiria que ela dormisse, comesse ou saísse da residência sem permissão. “O sr. Warner cometeu atos sexuais com a sra. Bianco quando ela estava inconsciente ou de outra forma incapaz de consentir. (…) Também cometeu agressão sexual contra a sra. Bianco em várias ocasiões”, destacaram os documentos apresentados ao tribunal.
Ainda segundo a atriz, Manson a obrigava a ficar dias sem dormir, a xingava quando ela reclamava do tratamento que recebia e a estuprava frequentemente e violentamente. Em uma ocasião, o roqueiro teria cortado Bianco com uma faca e postado as imagens das feridas nas redes sociais, sem a permissão dela.
No processo, a atriz alegou que sofreu agressões enquanto moravam juntos e tem cicatrizes no corpo até hoje. Ela disse também que Manson a perseguia com um machado e, quando recebia convidados em casa, mostrava repetidamente cenas de sexo dela em “Game of thrones” para envergonhá-la.
Segundo Esmo, o processo envolvia ainda sessões de tortura com “golpes, mordidas, cortes e chicotadas, todas sem o consentimento da vítima.” A violência começou nas filmagens do clipe de “I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies,” onde teria sido agredida pelo cantor ao longo de quatro dias seguidos.
Na época em que o caso veio à tona, o advogado dele disse que as acusações eram falsas. “Para deixar claro, este processo só foi aberto depois que meu cliente se recusou a ceder a exigências financeiras ultrajantes com base em uma conduta que simplesmente nunca ocorreu. Vamos contestar vigorosamente essas alegações no tribunal e estamos confiantes de que venceremos”, disse Howard E King.
Vários meses após o processo de Bianco, os detetives do Condado de Los Angeles invadiram a casa de Manson em uma investigação relacionada a abuso sexual e acusações de agressão contra o cantor. As descobertas dessa busca e uma investigação mais ampla, que foram entregues ao escritório da promotoria em 2022. Desde então, nenhuma acusação foi feita, apesar do número significativo de reclamações de outras mulheres, incluindo a ex-noiva de Manson, Evan Rachel Wood.",2023-01-26T21:26:03Z,https://gizmodo.uol.com.br,Gizmodo Brasil
"Marilyn Manson, actor Esme Bianco settle sex abuse lawsuit","LOS ANGELES (AP) — “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco has agreed to settle a federal lawsuit with rocker Marilyn Manson in which she alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, attorneys for both sides said Wednesday.
Bianco reached the agreement in her lawsuit against Manson and his record company “in order to move on with her life and career,” lawyer Jay Ellwanger said in an email.
Manson’s attorney Howard King also confirmed the agreement in an email. He previously said the actions alleged in the suit “simply never happened” and were “provably false.”

In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles in 2021, Bianco said Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England in 2009 and 2011 under the false pretenses of roles in music videos and movies that never materialized.
The suit alleged Manson deprived Bianco of food and sleep, gave her alcohol and drugs, locked her in a bedroom, whipped her, cut her, gave her electric shocks, tried to force her to have sex with another woman and threatened to enter her room and rape her during the night.
A Tuesday court filing says a request for dismissal, which remains subject to a judge’s approval, will be filed in the next 45 days. Details of the terms were not released.
Two similar lawsuits against Manson, one filed by a former assistant, the other by a model, have been dismissed by judges while at least one more remains.
In September, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department handed over a 19-month criminal investigation of women’s sexual abuse allegations against Manson, but prosecutors said more evidence needed to be gathered before they could decide whether he should be charged.
Manson is also suing his former fiancée, Evan Rachel Wood, alleging the “Westworld” actor conspired with a friend to use false allegations and pretenses to get other women to come forward about him.
In a court declaration, Wood said she had never pressured anyone to make false allegations against Manson.
Bianco and others aired their allegations after Wood said on social media early in 2021 that Manson sexually, physically and emotionally abused her during their relationship. Manson’s record label and agents dropped him at the time.
Wood expanded on her experience with Manson in an HBO documentary, “Phoenix Rising,” that aired last year.

Esmé Bianco anklagar Marylin Manson för våldtäkt,"I ett uttalande säger Biancos advokat Jay Ellwanger att hans klient ingår förlikningen ”för att gå vidare med sitt liv och sin karriär”, skriver The Hollywood Reporter.
Enligt stämningen som lämnades in i april 2021 använde sig Manson av falska erbjudanden om film- och musikvideoroller för att locka Esmé Bianco, som är från Storbritannien, till Los Angeles. Hon ska bland annat ha utsatts för piskning och elektriska stötar under det som hon trodde var en professionell videoinspelning.

Vid ett tillfälle skar Manson henne med en kniv under sex utan hennes samtycke, fotograferade skärsåren och lade ut bilderna på nätet, enligt stämningsansökan.
Manson ska ha hotat med att få hennes visum återkallat om hon flydde från hans lägenhet medan han sov.
I stämningen namnges också Mansons tidigare manager Tony Ciulla. Bianco hävdar att de bröt mot traffickinglagar när ”Manson på bedrägliga grunder förde henne till USA.”

Marilyn Manson, som egentligen heter Brian Warner, har flera rättsprocesser hängande över sig där bland andra ex-fästmön Evan Rachel Wood och ex-flickvännen Ashley Morgan Smithline anklagar honom för våldtäkt, övergrepp i hemmet och misshandel.
Han förnekar alla anklagelser om övergrepp och kallar dem för en ”konspiration av kvinnor som försöker rida på Metoo-vågen med påhittade historier” och säger att hans intima relationer har alltid varit byggda på samtycke med likasinnade partner.

Bianco, 40, filed the lawsuit in April 2021, writing that Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, “used drugs, force and threats of force to coerce sexual acts from Ms. Bianco on multiple occasions.” She said Manson raped her “in or around” May 2011.
The “Games of Thrones” star was one of several women who accused Manson of sexual assault and harassment. Manson, 54, has denied all the allegations.
In her suit, Bianco said Manson enticed her to travel from the U.K. to Los Angeles to film a music video in 2009 and a movie in 2011. Neither project was ever produced.
Bianco said Manson then denied her food and performed sex acts while she was unconscious and unable to consent.
“These acts include spanking, biting, cutting and whipping Ms. Bianco’s buttocks, breasts, and genitals for Mr. Warner’s sexual gratification — all without the consent of Plaintiff,” the suit said.
Bianco was one of four women to sue Manson for sexual assault and harassment. Two of the lawsuits have since been dismissed. The fourth remains active.

Marilyn Manson: Εξωδικαστικός συμβιβασμός με ηθοποιό που τον κατήγγειλε για βιασμό,"Η Esmé Bianco τον κατήγγειλε πριν δύο χρόνια για βιασμό
Ο μουσικός Marilyn Manson και η Esmé Bianco κατέληξαν σε συμφωνία για τον διακανονισμό της αγωγής που κατέθεσε σε βάρος του η ηθοποιός πριν από δύο χρόνια, καταγγέλλοντας βιασμό και σεξουαλική κακοποίηση.
Τον Απρίλιο του 2021, η Bianco, η οποία συμμετείχε στην τηλεοπτική σειρά Game of Thrones, μήνυσε τον Manson μετά και τις πολλαπλές καταγγελίες άλλων γυναικών ότι ο μουσικός τις είχε κακοποιήσει.
Και οι δύο πλευρές επιβεβαίωσαν τον εξωδικαστικό συμβιβασμό στο περιοδικό Rolling Stone, αλλά δεν έδωσαν λεπτομέρειες για τα συμφωνηθέντα.
ΔΕΙΤΕ ΑΚΟΜΑ ΔΙΕΘΝΗ Evan Rachel Wood: Ο Marilyn Manson με βίασε κατά τη διάρκεια γυρισμάτων βίντεο κλιπ του
Ο δικηγόρος της Bianco, Jay Ellwanger, δήλωσε: «Η κα Bianco συμφώνησε να επιλύσει τις αξιώσεις της κατά του Brian Warner και της Marilyn Manson Records Inc προκειμένου να προχωρήσει στη ζωή και την καριέρα της».
Η νομική ομάδα του Manson, το πραγματικό όνομα του οποίου είναι Brian Warner, δήλωσε στο περιοδικό: «Η κα Bianco συμφώνησε να επιλύσει τις αξιώσεις της κατά του Brian Warner και της Marilyn Manson Records Inc.»
Στην αγωγή της, η ηθοποιός κατηγορούσε τον Manson ότι με «δόλιες προσφορές ρόλων σε ταινίες και μουσικά βίντεο» έπεισε την ενάγουσα να ταξιδέψει στο Λος Άντζελες και στη συνέχεια την απείλησε και «άσκησε βίαιες σεξουαλικές πράξεις» σε βάρος της, στις οποίες «δεν συναίνεσε».
«Ο κ. Warner βίασε την κα Bianco τον Μάιο του 2011 ή περίπου τον Μάιο του 2011» αναφερόταν στην αγωγή. Ακόμα, ο μουσικός κατηγορήθηκε πως κλείδωσε την ηθοποιό σε ένα υπνοδωμάτιο και την ανάγκασε να μαγειρεύει και να καθαρίζει δωρεάν.
Η νομική ομάδα του Manson αρνήθηκε τις κατηγορίες, χαρακτηρίζοντάς τες «αποδεδειγμένα ψευδείς» και προσθέτοντας: «Για να είμαστε σαφείς, η μήνυση αυτή κατατέθηκε μόνο αφού ο πελάτης μου αρνήθηκε να (...) ενδώσει στις εξωφρενικές οικονομικές απαιτήσεις τους (σ.σ. της ηθοποιού και των δικηγόρων της) που βασίζονται σε συμπεριφορές που απλώς δεν συνέβησαν ποτέ».

"Marilyn Manson, ‘Game of Thrones’ actress Esmé Bianco settle sexual assault suit","Rock musician Marilyn Manson reached a settlement with actress Esmé Bianco on Tuesday in a sexual assault lawsuit she filed against him in 2021.
The “Game of Thrones” actress had accused Manson of raping her in 2011 and using “drugs, force and threats of force to coerce sexual acts” in several incidents.
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, filed a motion to dismiss the case in July 2021, arguing Bianco’s allegations were “untrue” and “part of a coordinated attack,” but his motion was later denied.
In the lawsuit, Bianco accused Manson of raping her while she was unconscious or not able to consent. Before filing the lawsuit, Bianco detailed the alleged abuse in an interview with The Cut, specifically saying he cut her with a knife and chased her with an ax.
According to court documents, Manson and Bianco reached a settlement agreement in private mediation. A dismissal to the lawsuit is expected to be filed within the next 45 days, according to the court documents.
“Ms. Bianco has agreed to resolve her claims against Brian Warner and Marilyn Manson Records, Inc,” Howard King, an attorney for Warner, told The Hill.
The Hill has reached out to Bianco’s representation for comment.

Marilyn Manson reaches deal with Esmé Bianco over sexual assault lawsuit,"The musician Marilyn Manson and actor Esmé Bianco have reached an agreement to settle a lawsuit that Bianco filed against him nearly two years ago, alleging rape and sexual battery.
In April 2021, Bianco, who starred in the television series Game of Thrones, sued Manson following multiple accusations by other women that the musician had abused them.
Both teams confirmed the out-of-court settlement to Rolling Stone magazine. Bianco’s lawyer Jay Ellwanger said: “Ms Bianco has agreed to resolve her claims against Brian Warner and Marilyn Manson Records Inc in order to move on with her life and career.” The legal team for Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, told the outlet: “Ms Bianco has agreed to resolve her claims against Brian Warner and Marilyn Manson Records Inc.”
Neither team disclosed the details of the settlement.
The lawsuit had accused Manson of making “fraudulent offers of movie and music video roles to convince Ms Bianco to travel to Los Angeles, whereupon Mr Warner then made threats of force and performed violent sexual acts on Ms. Bianco to which she did not consent”.
It accused Manson of raping and sexually battering Bianco, stating: “Mr Warner raped Ms Bianco in or around May 2011,” and alleged Manson had sexually battered Bianco, specifically by “spanking, biting, cutting, and whipping Ms Bianco’s buttocks, breasts, and genitals for Mr Warner’s sexual gratification – all without the consent of plaintiff.”
The lawsuit also accused Manson of encouraging Bianco to move from London to Los Angeles to participate in an unreleased music video and a movie that was never made.
“By inserting himself in Ms. Bianco’s visa process, Mr Warner was able to control Ms Bianco by threatening to withdraw support if she displeased him,” the lawsuit said, adding that Manson had violated California’s human trafficking laws by allegedly locking Bianco in a bedroom at one point and forcing her to cook and clean for free.
Manson’s legal team denied the accusations, calling them “provably false”, and adding: “To be clear, this suit was only filed after my client refused to be shaken down by Ms Bianco and her lawyer and give in to their outrageous financial demands based on conduct that simply never occurred. We will vigorously contest these allegations in court and are confident that we will prevail.”",2023-01-25T17:09:20Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
Esmé Bianco and Marilyn Manson Settle Sexual-Assault Lawsuit,"Photo-Illustration: Vulture. Photos: Getty Images
Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco and singer Marilyn Manson (real name Brian Warner) have settled the sexual-assault lawsuit Bianco filed against both Warner and his business, Marilyn Manson Records, Inc., in 2021, according to Rolling Stone. In statements to Rolling Stone, lawyers for both parties said Bianco “agreed to resolve her claims against Brian Warner and Marilyn Manson Records, Inc.,” with Bianco’s lawyer, Jay Ellwanger, adding “in order to move on with her life and career.”
The suit alleged that in 2009 Warner gave “fraudulent offers of movie and music video roles to convince Ms. Bianco to travel to Los Angeles, whereupon Mr. Warner then made threats of force and performed violent sexual acts on Ms. Bianco to which she did not consent,” according to the New York Times. It originally named Manson’s manager, Tony Ciulla, as well, though his name was later removed from the suit, according to RS. Bianco claimed Warner then convinced her, in 2011, to move to Los Angeles while he helped her “secure a visa and launch her career in the United States.” They then entered a consensual relationship, during which time she endured “constant abuse,” including being raped, “in or around May 2011.” “By inserting himself in Ms. Bianco’s visa process, Mr. Warner was able to control Ms. Bianco by threatening to withdraw support if she displeased him,” the suit alleged.
Bianco’s suit is one of many allegations brought against Warner in recent years. Notably, actress Evan Rachel Wood named Warner as her abuser in 2021 on Instagram in a now-deleted post. “He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” she wrote. “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.” Wood later detailed abuse she allegedly endured while in a relationship with Manson in a two-part documentary, Phoenix Rising. Manson has denied Wood’s allegations against him. More than a dozen women have came forward with claims, with several filing lawsuits. Since then, a suit by Warner’s former personal assistant Ashley Walters and a suit by Ashley Morgan Smithline have been dismissed, Walters’s due to the statute of limitations and Smithline’s after she missed a deadline. According to RS, a suit filed by a Jane Doe is still standing.",2023-01-25T15:50:20Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
Marilyn Manson & Esme Bianco Settle Sexual Assault Lawsuit,"Actress Esme Bianco and Marilyn Manson have reached a settlement to end her sexual assault lawsuit against the rocker, one of several such cases accusing Manson of abuse.
In a filing made Tuesday in Los Angeles federal court, attorneys for both sides alerted the judge that they had “reached an agreement in principle” to “resolve” the case. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
Jay D. Ellwanger, lawyer for Bianco, confirmed to Billboard that the actress had “agreed to resolve her claims against Brian Warner and Marilyn Manson Records, Inc. in order to move on with her life and career.” An attorney for Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Bianco was one of several women to accuse Manson of sexual abuse or other wrongdoing over the past two years.
Evan Rachel Wood, who began publicly dating Manson in 2007 when she was 19 and he was 39, accused him in a February 2021 Instagram post of “grooming me when I was a teenager” before he “horrifically abused me for years.” Those allegations were followed by separate lawsuits from model Ashley Morgan Smithline, former assistant Ashley Walters, and an unnamed Jane Doe accuser.
Bianco added her own lawsuit in April 2021, claiming Warner had, among other shocking allegations, “used drugs, force and threats of force to coerce sexual acts” and had “locked Ms. Bianco in the bedroom, tied her to a prayer kneeler and beat her with a whip that Mr. Warner said was utilized by the Nazis.”
Manson strongly denied the allegations, filing a motion to dismiss the case in which he accused Bianco of “cynically and dishonestly seeking to monetize and exploit the #MeToo movement.” He’s gone so far as to file a defamation lawsuit against Wood, claiming she had “secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously” with false allegations against the rocker. Wood denies the allegations and the case is pending.
Bianco’s lawsuit is the second against Manson to end in recent weeks. On Jan. 3, a federal judge dismissed Smithline’s case, citing the fact that she failed to retain a new lawyer after splitting with her old legal team last fall.",2023-01-25T14:09:24Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Esme Bianco Sexual Assault Lawsuit Against Marilyn Manson Dismissed,"""Game of Thrones"" actress Esmé Bianco's sexual assault lawsuit against Marilyn Manson was dismissed on Wednesday.

""Game of Thrones"" actress Esmé Bianco and shock rock artist Marilyn Manson have settled a sexual assault lawsuit that was mounted against Manson in 2021 and modified several times.
Bianco sued Manson in April 2021, claiming that he ""committed sexual acts"" with her without her consent and subjected her to forced drug use. Her lawsuit was amended in May 2022 to include an accusation of tortious interference, specifically that Manson had tanked her business ventures.
In a Tuesday court filing reviewed by Insider, attorneys for the parties said that they met on January 17 and reached a settlement deal. According to a judge's ruling on Wednesday, the case is now dismissed.
""As a result of the private mediation, the Parties have reached an agreement in principle to resolve the above-referenced litigation,"" Manson's attorney Howard King wrote in the filing. ""The parties are finalizing the papers documenting their agreement and anticipate a dismissal being filed within 45 days.""
Bianco, who played the character Ros on ""Game of Thrones,"" had filed the civil lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and did not specify the damages sought for the sexual assault and battery claims.
""Ms. Bianco has agreed to resolve her claims against Brian Warner and Marilyn Manson Records, Inc. in order to move on with her life and career,"" Jay Ellwanger, Bianco's attorney, told Insider. An attorney for Manson reiterated to Insider that Bianco agreed to resolve the claims.
Her original lawsuit also included a claim that Manson violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which was later dropped in an amended complaint. Manson's attorneys previously tried and failed to ask a judge to dismiss the suit.
Since 2021, Manson has faced numerous sexual misconduct allegations, with actor Evan Rachel Wood becoming the first person to publicly accuse him of abuse.
Bianco later sued Manson, and two other women who sued Manson on similar grounds have had their lawsuits dismissed in 2022 and early 2023. Manson sued Evan Rachel Wood for defamation in March 2022 related to her claims of sexual abuse about him.
Bianco and Manson dated in 2011, and the actress first spoke publicly about the allegations in a New York Magazine interview in February 2021. Manson denied the allegations made by the women and called them ""horrible distortions of reality"" during the same month as others spoke out as well.
Through the cases, Manson's attorney had insinuated that the women worked together to coordinate their claims.
In a filing related to Bianco's case, King claimed that the lawsuits were ""a key component of a coordinated attack by multiple plaintiffs, who are cynically and dishonestly seeking to monetize and exploit the #MeToo movement.""",2023-01-25T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Marilyn Manson Reaches Deal With Esmé Bianco Over Rape & Abuse Claims,"UPDATE, 8:30 PM: After nearly two years, Marilyn Manson has reached an agreement with Esmé Bianco to end the Game of Thrones actress’ sexual assault and sexual battery case against him.
“Ms. Bianco has agreed to resolve her claims against Brian Warner and Marilyn Manson Records, Inc,” lawyer Howard E. King told Deadline on behalf of Manson (a.k.a. Warner) and the record label. Bianco’s attorney released a similar statement Tuesday too, stating his client wanted “to move on with her life and career.”
The details of the settlement are shrouded, but clearly at least one of the parties sought to have this taken off the docket and out of the public eye.
Filed in federal court in April 2021, Bianco’s action alleged that Manson/Warner had used “fraudulent offers of movie and music video roles to convince Ms. Bianco to travel to Los Angeles, whereupon Mr. Warner then made threats of force and performed violent sexual acts on Ms. Bianco to which she did not consent.” Bianco said she was asked to come over from the UK to LA by Manson under the pretense of working on one of his elaborate music videos. The job and video apparently never panned out, but the actress alleged that after moving into the fading shock rocker’s West Hollywood apartment in 2011, Manson tried to control her entire life.
“Mr. Warner raped Ms. Bianco in or around May 2011,” Bianco’s unsuccessfully challenged suit claims. She added that Manson would not allow her to sleep, eat, or leave the residence without permission.
Several months after Bianco’s lawsuit, the LA County Sheriff’s Department detectives raided Manson’s West LA home in a probe connected to sexual abuse and assault allegations against the “Beautiful People” singer. The findings of that search and larger investigation were turned over the LA Country D.A.s office in 2022. Since then, no charges have been forthcoming despite the significant number of claims from other women, including Manson’s ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood.
1st UPDATE, Oct 7 PM: A U.S. District Court Judge is allowing former Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco’s lawsuit against Brian Warner, aka Marilyn Manson, to proceed.
Manson’s legal team attempted to dismiss Bianco’s lawsuit on statute-of-limitations grounds. The lawsuit, originally filed by Bianco and attorney Jay Ellwanger in April 2021, alleges that on multiple instances Warner physically, sexually, psychologically, and emotionally abused Bianco.
The judge wrote that “a reasonable jury could find that the effects of Warner’s alleged unconscionable acts, including the perceived threat to Plaintiff’s safety, immigration status, and career, persisted years after her last contact with Warner,” and ordered Warner to file a formal answer to each of the claims made in the lawsuit within fourteen days.
“My hope is that this ruling empowers other survivors to pursue justice for themselves while signaling to abusers that they cannot bully victims into silence,” said Bianco in a statement.
Tony Ciulla, the former manager of Marilyn Manson, was named as a defendant in the initial complaint from Bianco, but dropped in an amended filing back in July.
PREVIOUSLY, April 30 PM : Three months after publicly accusing Marilyn Manson of physical and psychological abuse, Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco today has sued the shock rocker for sexual assault and sexual battery.
“Mr. Warner used drugs, force, and threats of force to coerce sexual acts from Ms. Bianco on multiple occasions,” states the detailed complaint filed in federal court in California by the actress who was involved with Manson AKA Brian Warner from 2009 to around 2013. “Mr. Warner raped Ms. Bianco in or around May 2011,’ the jury trial seeking filing adds (read it here).
“Ms. Bianco was well aware of the violence Mr. Warner could dole out if she fought back, having been on the receiving end of his temper many times,” continues the 10-page document from attorney Jay D. Ellwanger on behalf of the British-born Bianco. “He also supplied drugs to Ms. Bianco and deprived her of sleep and food in order to weaken her physically and mentally and decrease her ability to refuse him. Mr. Warner committed sexual acts with Ms. Bianco when she was unconscious or otherwise unable to consent.”
The complaint also names Manson’s ex-manager as a defendant.
Tony Ciulla and his self-titled company are accused of violating human trafficking laws because they flew her from the UK to LA in 2007 and 2011 with promises of work in an unreleased music video and unmade film. Bianco additionally alleges she was forced to perform “unpaid labor” by Manson. That work included “serving and preparing food for Mr. Warner and his guests, cleaning his apartment, consulting on his album, providing uncredited backup vocals during the creative process for the album Born Villain, and being offered up to his guests and bandmates to ‘spank,'” the suit says.
Bianco is asking for wide-ranging damages from the court.
Manson — whose real name is Brian Warner — spoke through an attorney, Howard E. King, who said the allegations have no merit. “These claims are provably false,” King said in a statement for his ‘Beautiful People’ singing client. “To be clear, this suit was only filed after my client refused to be shaken down by Ms. Bianco and her lawyer and give in to their outrageous financial demands based on conduct that simply never occurred. We will vigorously contest these allegations in court and are confident that we will prevail.”
Among a number of claims against him, Manson is also currently under investigation by the LA Sheriff’s department for multiple domestic abuse allegations from approximately half-a-dozen women, and maybe more.
“It took Ms. Bianco years to understand the extent of Mr. Warner’s physical, sexual,
psychological, and emotional abuse,” today’s filing says. “Her career suffered due to the deterioration of her mental health caused by Mr. Warner. She deals with complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety, depression, and panic attacks to this day as a result.”
Magicians alum Bianco has been a major proponent along with another ex of Manson’s, Evan Rachel Wood, of California’s Phoenix Act, which extended the Golden State’s statute of limitations on domestic violence by five years. The Phoenix Act became law last year.
Manson was dropped by CAA, his label and roles in Starz’s American Gods and Shudder’s Creepshow in early February after Wood detailed her own wretched experiences with the “Beautiful People” singer. Taking to social media at the time, Wood wrote that the now 52-year old Manson “horrifically” abused her when they were together. The Westworld actress and anti-domestic violence activist also stated that Manson was systematically “grooming” her when she was still a teenager. “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission,” revealed Wood. “I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander or blackmail.”
Manson, at the time, denied the allegations.

Game Of Thrones star Esme Bianco settles Marilyn Manson ‘abuse’ lawsuit,"Game Of Thrones actress Esme Bianco has agreed to settle a US federal lawsuit with rocker Marilyn Manson in which she alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, lawyers for both sides said.
Bianco reached the agreement in her lawsuit against Manson and his record company “in order to move on with her life and career”, lawyer Jay Ellwanger said in an email.
Manson’s legal representative Howard King also confirmed the agreement in an email.
He previously said the actions alleged in the suit “simply never happened” and were “provably false”.
In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles in 2021, Bianco alleged Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England in 2009 and 2011 under the false pretences of roles in music videos and films that never materialised.

A request for dismissal, which remains subject to a judge’s approval, will be filed in the next 45 days.
Details of the terms were not released.
Two similar lawsuits against Manson, one filed by a former assistant, the other by a model, have been dismissed by judges while at least one more remains.
In September, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department handed over a 19-month criminal investigation of women’s sexual abuse allegations against Manson, but prosecutors said more evidence needed to be gathered before they could decide whether he should be charged.
Manson is also suing his former fiancee, Evan Rachel Wood, alleging the Westworld actress conspired with a friend to use false allegations and pretences to get other women to come forward about him.
In a court declaration, Wood said she had never pressured anyone to make false allegations against Manson.

Bianco and others aired their allegations after Wood alleged on social media early in 2021 that Manson sexually, physically and emotionally abused her during their relationship.
Manson’s record label and agents dropped him at the time.
Wood expanded on her experience with Manson in an HBO documentary, Phoenix Rising, that aired last year.

26歲妹子酒駕衝撞「4民宅大爆炸」賠4億 她控酒商有責任,"▲女子聲稱酒商在知道酒客喝醉的情況下，還持續提供酒飲，才會釀成這起意外發生。（圖／翻攝自@WaveroomTv推特）
圖文／CTWANT
加拿大26歲女子雷斯（Daniella Leis）在安大略省倫敦市的百威啤酒花園體育館，參加瑪莉蓮曼森（Marilyn Manson）的演唱會，由於她喝到爛醉被趕出會場，沒想到她駕車回家途中竟衝撞一棟民宅，甚至撞壞天然氣管線，引發大爆炸，最後釀成4棟房屋被炸毀、7人受傷，損失估計高達4.4億元新台幣，沒想到她事後竟控告當初提供酒精的業者，認為對方必須為意外負責。
根據《紐約郵報》報導，這起意外發生於2019年8月，雷斯酒駕後，不小心衝撞民宅，由於她還破壞了一條天然氣管線，引發大爆炸，導致附近幾戶住家起火，整座社區必須撤離，甚至造成附近區域瓦斯和自來水無法使用。
據報導，這起爆炸的損失估計達980萬美元到1470萬美元，約2.9億至4.4億元新台幣，雷斯後來承認4項罪名，於2021年被判處3年徒刑。不過雷斯本月和父親肖恩雷斯 (Shawn Leis)對經銷烈酒的公司OvationsOntario Food Services提出訴訟，認為是工作人員把醉醺醺的雷斯趕出會場，並未確保她能安全開車回家。
雷斯聲稱，酒商在知道酒客喝醉的情況下還持續提供酒飲，因此指責酒商將「利潤置於安全之上」，才會釀成這起意外發生，作為賠償，這對父女認為酒商要對法院的任何裁決或判決金額負責。

Women sues bar after getting so drunk she blew up $10M home,"She was so bombed she blew up a house.
A Canadian woman who caused a $10 million house explosion while driving drunk is now suing the bar that provided her alcoholic beverages — as she claims the owners are to blame.
The “car bomb” fiasco occurred in August 2019 while Daniella Leis, 26, was driving home from a Marilyn Manson concert after having drinks at the Budweiser Gardens bar in London, Ontario, the CBC reported.
Leis crashed her Ford Fusion — registered to her father — into a brick home at 450 Woodman Avenue, rupturing a gas line and triggering massive explosion that destroyed four houses and injured seven people.
Falling embers led to blazes in several homes nearby — and the entire neighborhood had to be evacuated with gas and water service shut off in the area. All told, the blast reportedly caused damages in the neighborhood of $9.8 million to $14.7 million.
“The financial impact of Ms. Leis’ actions have been enormous, with a total damage estimate approaching $15 million,” judge George Orsini told the court at the time.
Meanwhile, no one died but seven people were injured, including two police officers and two fire fighters suffered numerous injuries, with one firefighter forced to spend more than a week in hospital before being discharged.

Leis subsequently pled guilty to four counts of impaired driving, and was was slapped with a three-year prison sentence in 2021.
However, the Canuck wasn’t about to throw away her shot at easing the financial strain.
Fast-forward to January 2024: She and father Shawn Leis have filed a lawsuit against the Ovations Ontario Food Services, the company that distributed the hooch. They co-claimed that the hooch purveyor shares liability in a lawsuit filed by blast victims on the grounds that staffers “ejected Leis from the venue while failing to take steps to ensure she would not drive home,” according to the legal documents.
In addition, Leis also alleged that the Ovations had served her alcohol while aware that the bar-goer was intoxicated, accusing them of putting “profit above safety” and the resulting damage was “caused or contributed to by the negligence, breach of duty, breach of contract” by the bar.
The damage totaled around $10. City of London, Ontario
The lawsuit further claimed that if the father-daughter duo is required to pay any amount, then they are “entitled to contribution and indemnity from the defendant [Ovation].”
As reparations, the father and daughter team believes that the booze distributor is responsible for “any awards or judgment amounts” resulting from multiple court claims levied against them by Woodman Avenue victims.",2023-01-17T20:35:21Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
“Los años maravillosos”: ¿Paul era Marilyn Manson? Actor aclara leyenda urbana,"Este quizás es uno de los primeros bulos de internet. Emitida entre 1988 a 1993, “Los años maravillosos”, protagonizada por Fred Savage, Danica McKellar y Josh Saviano, llegó a la televisión para mostrar cómo los problemas de adolescentes, el amor, la familia y la muerte se unieron para dar vida a una de las series más icónicas de la TV.
Con el final de “The Wonder Years”, cada intérprete tomó caminos distintos. Uno de ellos, Saviano, que dio vida a Paul Pfeiffer, se alejó de la industria y decidió estudiar Derecho. Mientras estaba en la universidad, un rumor sobre él y Marilyn Manson se hizo popular en foros de internet.

El rumor de Marilyn Manson interpretando a Paul Pfeiffer es falso
Sin saber de dónde nació el rumor de que Brian Warner (Marilyn Manson) dio vida a Paul Pfeiffer, en el 2013 el actor Josh Saviano habló con el programa “The Yo Show” de Yahoo! sobre este tema. Más allá de molestarse por ser parte de un viral que lleva décadas en internet, él lo tomó como algo anecdótico.
“Debo ser uno de los primeros rumores de internet, esto data desde 1994, y la red recién estaba a punto de ser lo que hoy es. Me entero de esto en la universidad gracias a mis compañeros, pero también por alguien de ‘Los años maravillosos’”, comentó.
Por aquel entonces, Saviano era un estudiante de leyes de la Universidad de Yale, y cuenta que se enteró de lo que decía la gente de él por Danica McKellar, Winnie Cooper en la serie que lo llevó a la fama.
“No tenía idea de quién era Marilyn Manson. Así que hablé con mis amigos para que me explicaran. Progresivamente, se convirtió en una anécdota divertida para todos en la escuela”, dijo Saviano.
Lo curioso es que el actor no solo habla de que Marilyn Manson ha estado relacionado con su personaje, también artistas como Lady Gaga y Patrick Carney. Más allá de estar interesado en que este rumor de “Los años maravillosos” muera en internet, dice que “le encanta”.
“Más de 20 años después, esto sigue. Pero no solo ha sido con él, otros músicos han sido relacionados. Lady Gaga, por ejemplo. Yo no tengo habilidad musical, así que me fascina”, explicó.

Marilyn Manson se livra de uma acusação de abuso sexual,"Marilyn Manson / Reprodução / Instagram/@marilynmanson
O polêmico Marilyn Manson conseguiu se livrar de uma das acusações que enfrenta de abuso sexual. Um desses processos acaba de ser arquivado pelas autoridades. Uma ex-namorada chamada Ashley Morgan Smithline, que acusou o rockeiro no ano passado de abuso sexual, físico e psicológico, teve o caso encerrado.
Leia+: Polícia é chamada à casa de Marilyn Manson para verificar segurança do artista
Segundo o advogado do artista, cujo nome real é Brian Hugh Warner, isso aconteceu depois que Ashley não conseguiu substituir seu ex-advogado jurídico.
Ela havia sido obrigada a encontrar um novo representante até 5 de dezembro de 2022, depois que a moção de retirada do advogado Jay D Ellwanger foi aprovada, mas a modelo não o fez.
Ela alegou no processo que Marilyn Manson a agrediu sexualmente em 2010 durante seu relacionamento que durou quase três anos, e afirmou que ‘sobreviveu ao monstro’ após anos de ‘lavagem cerebral’.
O processo poderá ser reaberto posteriormente por ela, mas por enquanto ele foi encerrado.
Segundo a coluna “Page Six” do jornal “The New York Post”, em uma declaração o advogado de Manson, Howard King, disse:
“Agradecemos e elogiamos Ashley Smithline por rejeitar suas reivindicações contra Brian Warner sem buscar ou receber nada em troca. A Sra. Smithline recusou-se a ser manipulada por outros que estão tentando perseguir suas próprias agendas contra o Sr. Warner. Desejamos-lhe felicidades e continuaremos a trabalhar para garantir que um preço significativo seja pago por aqueles que tentaram abusar do nosso sistema legal”.

O cantor sempre se defendeu das acusações. Ele disse em um comunicado postado no Instagram: “Obviamente, minha vida e minha arte há muito tempo são ímãs de controvérsia, mas essas recentes afirmações sobre mim são distorções horríveis da realidade. Meus relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram totalmente consensuais com parceiras que pensam da mesma forma. Independentemente de como – e por que – os outros estão escolhendo deturpar o passado, essa é a verdade.”.
PROBLEMAS COM A LEI
Em 2021, Marilyn Manson teve sérios problemas com a lei, e acabou se entregando à polícia de New Hampshire, nos Estados Unidos, após um mês como procurado. Acusado de ter cuspido em um cinegrafista, o músico compareceu ao departamento da polícia local no dia 2 de julho, informou o TMZ.
A polícia confirmou que a suposta agressão ocorreu durante o show em agosto de 2019, e também explicou que o cinegrafista foi contratato pela produção do evento.
Fontes familiarizadas com o caso disseram que o cameraman alegou ter sido atingindo por parte da cusparada de Manson, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Hugh Warner. Isso teria sido o principal motivo para que a polícia fosse procurada.
De acordo com o TMZ, Manson foi liberado depois de pagar uma fiança de cerca de US$ 2 mil. O músico teve de se comprometer a não cometer outros crimes enquanto estiver em liberdade e terá de comparecer às audiências judiciais.
Ainda segundo o site norte-americano, as autoridades emitiram o mandado de prisão pela primeira vez em outubro de 2019, mas em maio deste ano disseram que Manson estava “se esquivando.”
ACUSAÇÕES DE ABUSO
A ficha policial de Manson ainda tem um processo polêmico em que pelo menos 15 mulheres o acusam de abuso e agressão sexual.
Muitas delas são ex-namoradas do cantor. Entre as famosas que denunciaram o cantor, estão Evan Rachel Wood, Phoebe Bridgers e Esmé Bianco, que descreveu cenas de tortura durante a gravação de um clipe que fez com Marilyn.
Na época, Manson negou todas as acusações.

Marilyn Manson sexual assault lawsuit dismissed without prejudice,"A 2021 lawsuit from model Ashley Morgan Smithline accusing Marilyn Manson of sexual assault, sexual battery, unlawful imprisonment and more has been dismissed by a California court. As the Los Angeles Times and Pitchfork report, the decision was made after Smithline failed to find new representation when her legal counsel withdrew from the case in October. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, meaning Smithline can refile the case if she finds new representation or chooses to represent herself.
The allegations in Smithline’s lawsuit aren’t the only such accusations Manson, real name Brian Warner, has faced in recent years. The 54-year-old rock musician is currently the subject of a lawsuit from actress Esmé Bianco that alleges he sexually assaulted her; in May, a lawsuit from Manson’s former assistant Ashley Walters accusing him of sexual assault and harassment was dismissed, due to the claims falling outside California’s statute of limitations. In 2021, one of Manson’s ex-girlfriends sued Manson, alleging he had raped her and tried to kill her; the lawsuit was dismissed for falling outside the statute of limitations but was refiled shortly after.
In a statement to Pitchfork, Manson’s lawyer Howard King said: “We thank and commend Ashley Smithline for dismissing her claims against Brian Warner without seeking or receiving anything in return. Ms Smithline has refused to be manipulated by others who are trying to pursue their own agendas against Mr Warner. We wish her well and will continue to work to assure that a significant price will be paid by those who have tried to abuse our legal system.”
All four lawsuits against Manson were filed after actress Evan Rachel Wood, Manson’s former partner, came forward with allegations of abuse against the musician in early 2021. “[Manson] started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” she said at the time. “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.” Wood further detailed her allegations in the documentary Phoenix Rising; Manson is currently suing her for defamation.",2023-01-05T14:04:43Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian

Marilyn Manson Sexual Abuse Lawsuit Dismissed By Judge,"A federal judge has tossed out a sexual abuse lawsuit filed against Marilyn Manson by model Ashley Morgan Smithline, citing the fact that she failed to retain a new lawyer after splitting with her old legal team last fall.
Smithline’s lawsuit, one of many claims of sexual abuse filed against Manson (real name Brian Warner) over the past two years, alleged that the rocker raped and abused her multiple times between 2010 and 2013. But in an order issued Tuesday (Jan. 3), Judge Fernando L. Aenlle-Rocha dismissed the case.
The reason? After Smithline split with her attorney Jay D. Ellwanger in October, the judge gave her until Dec. 5 to find a new lawyer — or to explain how she’d handle the case on her own as a so-called pro se litigant. She never did either, leading to Tuesday’s decision.
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
“Plaintiff has not filed a response as of the date of this order,” the judge wrote. “The court, therefore, dismisses this action … for plaintiffs failure to prosecute the action.”
The case was dismissed “without prejudice” — meaning Smithline could still refile the same claims at some point in the future. She could not immediately be located for comment; Ellwanger did not return a request for comment.
In a statement to Billboard, Manson’s attorney Howard King praised the outcome: “We thank and commend Ashley Smithline for dismissing her claims against Brian Warner without seeking or receiving anything in return. Ms. Smithline has refused to be manipulated by others who are trying to pursue their own agendas against Mr. Warner. We wish her well and will continue to work to assure that a significant price will be paid by those who have tried to abuse our legal system.”
Manson has faced multiple accusations of wrongdoing over the past two years.
Evan Rachel Wood, who began publicly dating Manson in 2007 when she was 19 and he was 39, accused him in a February 2021 Instagram post of “grooming me when I was a teenager” before he “horrifically abused me for years.” Those allegations were followed by separate lawsuits from Smithline, former assistant Ashley Walters, Game of Thrones actress Esme Bianco and a Jane Doe accuser.
In her lawsuit, Smithline made graphic and disturbing allegations of sexual assault against Manson. She alleged that she and Manson began a consensual relationship in 2010, but that it “quickly became apparent that consensual sex was not enough for Mr. Warner.”
“Ms. Smithline awoke from unconsciousness with her ankles and wrists tied together behind her back and Mr. Warner sexually penetrating her,” Smithline’s lawyers wrote in the lawsuit. “Ms. Smithline told Mr. Warner to stop and said no multiple times, and Mr. Warner told her to ‘shut the fuck up’ and ‘be quiet.’”
Manson has denied all of the allegations against him and even filed his own defamation lawsuit accusing Wood and another woman of orchestrating the many legal attacks against him. In the March 2022 complaint, he said Wood’s own “malicious falsehood” was part of an “organized attack” aimed at derailing his career, in which she had “secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously.” Wood denies those allegations.",2023-01-05T00:12:15Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

A lawsuit against Marilyn Manson, alleging that he sexually, psychologically and physically abused his ex-girlfriend Ashley Morgan Smithline, has been ""thrown out of court"".
Ashley claimed that Marilyn, real name Brian Hugh Warner, committed the alleged offences during their two-year relationship which began in 2010.
She was one of 15 women who had made allegations against him – but a judge has now dismissed Ashely's case without prejudice.
According to legal documents seen by The Mirror, the reason for the judge's decision is because she had failed to provide proper legal representation within the allotted time frame.
Ashley was being represented by Jay Ellwanger, however but the attorney 'withdrew his representation'.

The Mirror has contacted Jay's office for a comment.
The court granted Ellwanger's motion to withdraw representation as Smithline's attorney on October 5, 2021, according to the legal documents.
Smithline was then ordered to file either a notice of new counsel or a decision to represent herself by December 5.
""The court, therefore, dismisses this action without prejudice, for Plaintiff’s failure to prosecute the action,"" it reads in the documents, seen by The Mirror.

He also faced accusations from other women – Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco and an unnamed woman who made sexual assault claims.
He also filed a lawsuit against ex Evan Rachel Wood for defamation following several claims aired in a documentary last year where she alleged that the singer 'raped her' after she aborted their child.
Speaking in court last year, Manson denied the allegations and accused another former partner of launching a smear campaign against him.

""I understand that on or around February 1, 2021, [they] posted to Instagram that I was her abuser, and shortly thereafter a number of other women simultaneously emerged with false public accusations against me of abuse, assault, rape, threats, trafficking, and the like,"" he told the court.
""I never abused, assaulted, raped, threatened, or trafficked any of these women, as they contend. Their accusations against me of abuse, assault, rape, threats, and the like are unequivocally false.""

Marilyn Manson Sexual Assault Lawsuit Dismissed,"Note: This article contains descriptions of alleged sexual assault and sexual battery.
A California court has dismissed without prejudice a 2021 lawsuit accusing Brian Warner—also known as Marilyn Manson—of sexual assault, as the Los Angeles Times reports and Pitchfork can confirm. Model and entertainer Ashley Morgan Smithline sued the musician for sexual assault, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unlawful imprisonment, and more. Warner has denied the allegations.
In October, Jay Ellwanger withdrew as Smithline’s attorney; she did not meet a deadline by December to acquire new representation or represent herself, leading to the court’s most recent decision. Smithline is able to re-file the case with new representation.
“We thank and commend Ashley Smithline for dismissing her claims against Brian Warner without seeking or receiving anything in return,” Howard King, Warner’s attorney, wrote in a statement provided to Pitchfork. “Ms. Smithline has refused to be manipulated by others who are trying to pursue their own agendas against Mr. Warner. We wish her well and will continue to work to assure that a significant price will be paid by those who have tried to abuse our legal system.”
Manson is currently facing a federal lawsuit from actress Esmé Bianco, who accused the musician of sexual assault and sexual battery. Manson is also suing Evan Rachel Wood for defamation, a reaction to her publicly naming him as her abuser in early 2021 and detailing her experiences in the documentary Phoenix Rising. In May, the Los Angeles Superior Court dismissed another lawsuit filed by a woman who had worked as Warner’s assistant, accusing him of sexual assault, battery, and harassment. Judge Michael Stern ruled that the claim could not proceed because alleged incidents happened beyond the state’s two-year statute of limitations.
Detectives with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Special Victims Bureau spent 19 months investigating sexual assault allegations against Warner, and they submitted the case to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office for review and complaint filing consideration in September.

Marilyn Manson accuser Ashley Morgan Smithline's case dismissed,"A California judge has tossed out a sexual abuse lawsuit on Tuesday filed by one of Marilyn Manson’s accusers after she failed to replace her former legal counsel, Page Six has learned.
Ashley Morgan Smithline, who previously accused the shock rocker of raping and abusing her during their two-year, on-and-off relationship, was advised to find new representation by Dec. 5, 2022, after her former lawyer Jay D. Ellwanger’s motion to withdraw was approved.
However, the model failed to find new representation or represent herself and so her case was thrown out.
The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, meaning she can refile the same claim at a later time if she wishes to do so.

Manson’s attorney Howard King tells Page Six, “We thank and commend Ashley Smithline for dismissing her claims against Brian Warner without seeking or receiving anything in return.
“Ms. Smithline has refused to be manipulated by others who are trying to pursue their own agendas against Mr. Warner. We wish her well and will continue to work to assure that a significant price will be paid by those who have tried to abuse our legal system.”
Although Ellwanger filed a motion to remove himself from the case, Manson’s legal team provided a series of text messages allegedly sent by Smithline that appear to show she actually tried to get rid of him first back in April 2022.

In a Sept. 1, 2022 court filing obtained by Page Six, Smithline tells Ellwanger in a text provided as an exhibit, “I am looking to discharge you. please let me know when it’s done and what needs to happen.”
Ellwanger responds by letting his then-client know that she needs new representation and that he believes someone may have hacked her phone.
He also states, “Ashley it’s not that simple. You have a federal court lawsuit pending. I’m not sure who is writing these text messages but it doesn’t sound like you. We need to speak on the phone.”
Ellwanger later wrote, “I am honestly very concerned about you — this is all very different behavior than I have ever seen from you and I’ve known you for over a year.”

A separate text exchange also showed the attorney and his client argued over an appointment she had with a psychiatrist in London, which led to her missing an important deposition.
However, the exact reason for why the pair had a falling out is unknown.
Page Six has made several attempts to reach out to Smithline for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication.
Prior to last year, Smithline and Ellwanger appeared to have a united front in their case against Manson, 53.
Smithline previously claimed Manson “bit her, whipped her, cut her with a swastika-emblazoned knife and shoved his fist in her mouth during sex.” ashleylindsaymorgan/Instagram
In June 2021, the pair went on “The View” together to detail Smithline’s alleged sexual misconduct experiences with the “Tainted Love” singer.
“I woke up bound and he was having sex with my unconscious body,” the Los Angeles native alleged of Manson with Ellwanger by her side.
“That was my first experience and then from there, the abuse just worsened. I was dehumanized, I was degraded, I was treated like an animal.”
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, has repeatedly denied Smithline’s claims – and those of the dozen other women who have come forward, including “Game of Thrones” actress Esmé Bianco, whom Ellwanger also represents.
“I understand that on or around February 1, 2021, [Evan Rachel] Wood posted to Instagram that I was her abuser, and shortly thereafter a number of other women simultaneously emerged with false public accusations against me of abuse, assault, rape, threats, trafficking and the like,” the “Beautiful People” singer previously said in his declaration to the court.
“These women include Ashley Morgan Smithline, Ashley Walters, Jane Doe, and Esme Bianco. To the extent I had relationships with these women, those relationships were consensual.”
He continued, “I never abused, assaulted, raped, threatened, or trafficked any of these women, as they contend. Their accusations against me of abuse, assault, rape, threats, and the like are unequivocally false.”

Manson and his legal team have maintained that his accusers have conspired to ruin his name for monetary gain, and as a result even filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood for her abuse claims in March 2022.
Wood, 35, insists, however, that she has the “truth” on her side.

Smithline had accused Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, of sexually assaulting her multiple times in 2010.
Manson denied Smithline's allegations, claiming his relationship with the model lasted less than a week and there was no abuse.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced in September that it turned over its investigation of sexual assault allegations against Manson to the District Attorney's Office for consideration of possible criminal charges.
The Sheriff's Department's Special Victims Bureau completed a 19-month investigation into Manson, according to the department. The bureau investigates sexual and physical abuse cases of children and felonious sexual assaults involving adult victims.
Manson, 53, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in the face of assault allegations brought by several women.
Manson was also sued in April 2021 in federal court by ""Game of Thrones'' actress Esmé Bianco for alleged sexual assault and sexual battery in what she described as a series of violent encounters.
According to the lawsuit, Bianco was invited to Los Angeles from the United Kingdom by Manson with the promise of work, and after moving into the Goth rocker's West Hollywood apartment in 2011, she was not allowed to eat, sleep or leave without his permission.
The Bianco case has been placed on hold, according to a filing by Aenlle-Rocha, who is also overseeing the Smithline suit.
A similar lawsuit brought by actress Evan Rachel Wood, who dated Manson for four years, is pending in Los Angeles Superior Court.

""Game of Thrones"" actress Esmé Bianco accused her ex-boyfriend, Marilyn Manson, of torpedoing a business deal to ""silence"" her after she publicly accused him of sexual assault, according to court documents filed Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Bianco, who is best known for playing the character of ""Ros"" on ""Game of Thrones,"" filed an amended complaint against Manson which includes a new accusation of tortious interference. She is asking for unspecified damages in the suit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.
Bianco originally sued Manson — whose real name is Brian Warner — on accusations of sexual assault, sexual battery, and violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.
She said Manson raped her, physically abused her during sex acts, used her as ""unpaid labor,"" and withheld food and rest. Bianco lived with Manson for a month in 2011.
The new allegations center on Manson's behavior toward Bianco after she filed the lawsuit in July 2021.
In her updated complaint, Bianco details how she signed a contract with the metal group Deftones in April 2022, to partake in a photo shoot that would be used in artwork for an upcoming tour.
But soon after she participated in the photo shoot, Manson found out about the deal and ""proceeded to call the band's lead singer and confront him"" over the band's ""decision to work with"" her, Bianco's complaint stated.
Bianco said in the complaint that Manson ""threatened the Deftones with actions that would disrupt the band's world tour, and which would have caused the Deftones financial harm.""
In response, Deftones members instructed the creative director not to use the photos of Bianco, according to the complaint.
Bianco said she suffered ""the loss of exposure from images being used during the Deftones' world tour"" and the lost gig ""resulted in reputational damage and a loss of future economic opportunity with the Deftones,"" according to the complaint.
Manson ""continues to work to silence Ms. Bianco through threats, intimidation, and coercion,"" the complaint reads.
Representatives for Manson, Bianco, and Deftones did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
Manson faced a flood of sexual misconduct allegations in 2021, when actress Evan Rachel Wood accused him on social media of being abusive during their four-year relationship.
Four other women, including Bianco, proceeded to sue Manson on abuse allegations, though two of those cases have since been dismissed. In fact, it was also on Tuesday that Ashley Smithline's sexual assault lawsuit against Manson was dismissed, after her lawyer dropped out of the case and she failed to retain new representation. Smithline was originally represented by Jay Ellwanger, Bianco's attorney.
In court filings, Manson's legal team has been pushing a theory that the women are working together to smear him with false allegations, citing the fact that many of them have openly spoken about meeting together in 2020, before they went public with their accusations.",2023-01-04T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER

A federal judge in California on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit against musician Marilyn Manson filed by his ex-girlfriend Ashley Smithline, who alleged that ""consensual sex was not enough for"" him and that he raped and emotionally abused her.
Smithline went silent after her attorney, Jay D. Ellwanger, dropped the case in October. She then failed to notify the court by a December 5 deadline whether she had hired a new attorney or would be representing herself.
US District Judge Fernando L. Aenlle-Rocha dismissed the case without prejudice on Tuesday, which gives Smithline the opportunity to file the lawsuit again in the future.
Insider reached out to Smithline and representatives of Manson for comment but did not immediately receive responses.
Smithline sued Manson and his record company in June 2021, accusing the musician of sexual assault, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and unlawful imprisonment — as well as violations of the Bane Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.
In her complaint, Smithline alleged Manson — whose real name is Brian Warner — started messaging her frequently when she was a model in Bangkok, Thailand, in the summer of 2010, trying to recruit her for a film project.
Manson eventually convinced her to come out to Los Angeles to take part in the project, she said, and she moved in with him shortly after, according to the complaint.
Smithline said in the complaint they began a ""consensual sexual relationship"" but ""it quickly became apparent"" that didn't satisfy Manson.
She alleged there were multiple incidents in which Manson raped her — including an incident in which he slashed her repeatedly with a knife when she resisted, according to the complaint.
Smithline said in the complaint that Warner threatened to kill her if she ever left him and ""exercised total control"" over her, forcing her to work as his personal chef, confiscating her phone, and locking her in a soundproof glass enclosure. She said she deals with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to this day, and still has some of the physical scars from Manson's attacks, according to the complaint.
In his answer to her complaint, Manson denied the abuse allegations and said they had a consensual sexual relationship.
In Smithline's complaint, she said she never understood ""the true extent"" of her injuries until she began meeting with ""other survivors of Mr. Warner's Abuse"" in 2020.
Manson is currently fighting abuse lawsuits from two other women, and he is under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for allegations of sexual assault.
Multiple women began accusing Manson of inappropriate behavior in February 2020 after the actress Evan Rachel Wood publicly accused him of being abusive during their four-year relationship.
Manson issued a statement saying ""these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.""
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
Manson has also filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood, accusing her of conspiring with her girlfriend, Ashley ""Ilma"" Gore, to falsify evidence backing Wood's claims.",2023-01-04T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER

Kat Von D is publicly supporting Marilyn Manson, who has faced sexual and physical abuse allegations from multiple women in recent years.
The controversial tattoo artist, 40, shared a photo of herself with Manson, 53, whose real name is Brian Warner, on Instagram Wednesday.
Von D said in the caption that Manson visited her at-home music studio in Los Angeles, California, and they're working on an unrevealed project together.
""My dear @marilynmanson came by the studio — we're working on a beautiful, special project we have coming up for you 🖤,"" she wrote in the caption.
A post shared by Kat Von D (@thekatvond)
Approximately one hour after sharing the post, Von D defended Manson against sexual abuse allegations in a lengthier note in the comments section of her post.
""I know first hand what it feels like to have society come to wildly incorrect conclusions about me, and having that spread out into the world - leaving people believing things that couldn't be further from the truth about me,"" she wrote.
Von D continued: ""Having seen evidence against the accusations against my friend, I can't in good faith just blindly burn someone at the stake just because 'everyone says I should.' I can think for myself, and I hope you can, too.""
Representatives for Von D did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. A representative for Manson declined to comment.

After comparing their public scrutiny experiences, Von D encouraged people to read the court documents Manson has previously shared online.
""Innocent until proven guilty should ring very true to us, especially after this last year,"" she wrote. ""So perhaps before spewing criticism and possible gossip (even though i know it comes from a good place) it might be a good idea to keep it to yourself until you have all information.""
""Feel free to read the actual court documents on the link in Manson's bio,"" she added. ""Sending everyone extra love regardless. 🖤""
Von D's followers shared mixed opinions in response, with some supporting the controversial figures while others said they were disappointed in the tattoo artist for working with Manson.
Leafer Seyer, Von D's husband, supported his wife and the unrevealed project, writing in her comments section: ""I can't wait for this! 🔥🔥🔥🔥""

Manson first publicly faced accusations of abuse and grooming in 2021
Evan Rachel Wood accused Manson of ""grooming"" her as a teenager and ""horrifically"" abusing her for years in a now-deleted Instagram post shared in February 2021. Wood was 19 when she began dating Manson, who was 38 at the time.
The ""Westworld"" actor said on Instagram that she was ""brainwashed and manipulated into submission"" by Manson and that she wanted to ""expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.""
Manson denied Wood's allegations in an Instagram post that same month. He acknowledged that his art and life are controversial, but called Wood's claims ""horrible distortions of reality.""
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners,"" he wrote. ""Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
Following Wood's post, other women came forward with their own accusations.
Phoebe Bridgers said Manson called a part of his house the ""rape room"" when she visited as a teenager, and musician Ellie Rowsell accused him of filming under her skirt at a festival. Esmé Bianco, a British actor, also said Manson was physically violent with her when they dated and often humiliated her in front of others.
Other accusers include Manson's former assistant, ex-girlfriends, and dozens of anonymous sources who spoke with Rolling Stone in 2021.
Following the widespread backlash, Manson returned to Instagram with another statement on March 2, 2021, which encouraged viewers to read the court documents he linked on his Instagram page.
""There will come a time when I can share more about the events of the past year,"" he wrote. ""Until then, I'm going to let the facts speak for themselves: [link in bio].""

Von D has also faced controversy throughout her career. She defended naming lipsticks ""Celebutard,"" ""Underage Red,"" and ""Selektion"" — a German word for selection used by Nazis.
She was also widely criticized in 2018 for saying she wouldn't vaccinate her child but later said she's not an anti-vaxxer in a now-deleted YouTube video titled, ""I am NOT a nazi. I am NOT anti-vaxx.""
Still, as Remezcla previously reported, many were unsatisfied with the video and said Von D did not mention key instances of anti-Semitism — like when her former boyfriend dressed up as a Nazi while they were dating, and the swastika tattoo her husband has (which he says is not German or ""political"") on his neck.",2022-12-01T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER

Ο Marilyn Manson, το πραγματικό όνομα του οποίου είναι Brian Warner, κατηγορείται για σεξουαλική παρενόχληση και κακοποίηση γυναικών, ανάμεσά τους και η πρώην αρραβωνιαστικιά του, Evan Rachel Wood.
Η 34χρονη τον Φεβρουάριο του 2021 ισχυρίστηκε ότι ο τραγουδιστής την κακοποίησε συναισθηματικά, σωματικά και σεξουαλικά κατά τη διάρκεια της επτάμηνης σχέσης τους.
Η σχέση τους έγινε γνωστή το 2007, όταν εκείνη ήταν 19 και εκείνος 38. Το 2010 αρραβωνιάστηκαν και επτά μήνες μετά χώρισαν.

Marilyn Manson: Τον έχουν καταγγέλλει για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση 15 γυναίκες,"Ο Μέριλιν δεν έχει δημοσιεύσει τίποτα για τους 16,3 εκατ. οπαδούς του στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης από τον περασμένο Μάρτιο
Ο πέντε φορές υποψήφιος για Grammy, Marilyn Manson, ισχυρίζεται ότι η καριέρα του βρίσκεται στα «τάρταρα» και ότι εξακολουθεί να δέχεται απειλές για τη ζωή του από τότε που 15 γυναίκες τον κατηγόρησαν για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση πέρυσι.
Ο 53χρονος τραγουδιστής δήλωσε σε νέα νομικά έγγραφα ότι οι διαδικτυακές απειλές θανάτου τον κάνουν να αισθάνεται «ανήσυχος, αναστατωμένος, καταθλιπτικός και άυπνος» και ανησυχεί, επίσης, μήπως κάποιος κάνει κακό στη δεύτερη σύζυγό του, Lindsay Usich, σύμφωνα με το «TMZ».
Ο Marilyn Manson (κατά κόσμον Μπράιαν Γουόρνερ) επιβεβαίωσε ότι τον «απέσυραν» από τη δισκογραφική του εταιρεία και ότι έχει αποκλειστεί από τις κοινωνικές και επαγγελματικές εκδηλώσεις του Χόλιγουντ. Ο Μάνσον ισχυρίζεται ότι η μουσική του υποφέρει, δεν μπορεί να περιοδεύσει, δεν μπορεί να κυκλοφορήσει το βιβλίο του, οι πίνακές του έχουν απαξιωθεί και οι καλλιτεχνικές του εκθέσεις έχουν αναβληθεί επ' αόριστον.
Ο γεννημένος στο Οχάιο μουσικός δήλωσε ότι οι ψευδείς ισχυρισμοί για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση είχαν σαν αποτέλεσμα να χάσει δύο ρόλους.
Ο Μέριλιν δεν έχει δημοσιεύσει τίποτα για τους 16,3 εκατ. οπαδούς του στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης από τον Μάρτιο, δεν έχει επιχειρήσει να εμφανιστεί ζωντανά, ενώ η ιστοσελίδα για την τέχνη του γράφει μόνο «έρχεται σύντομα».
Ο Μάνσον συνεργάστηκε πρόσφατα με τον ράπερ-σχεδιαστή Kanye «Ye» West στο άλμπουμ του «Donda». Τα προβλήματα του ροκά «We Are Chaos» ξεκίνησαν όταν η πρώην αρραβωνιαστικιά του, Evan Rachel Wood, βγήκε μπροστά τον Φεβρουάριο του 2021 με ισχυρισμούς ότι την κακοποίησε συναισθηματικά, σωματικά και σεξουαλικά κατά τη διάρκεια της επτάμηνης σχέσης τους. Οι ισχυρισμοί της 35χρονης υποψήφιας για Emmy παρουσιάστηκαν λεπτομερώς σε ντοκιμαντέρ τον περασμένο Μάρτιο στο HBO.
Η Wood ήταν μόλις 18 ετών όταν δημοσιοποίησε το ειδύλλιό της με τον Μάνσον τον Ιανουάριο του 2007, 13 ημέρες μετά την οριστικοποίηση του διαζυγίου του από τη χορεύτρια, Dita Von Teese.
Τέσσερις άλλες γυναίκες -η πρώην βοηθός του Ashley Walters, το μοντέλο Ashley Smithline, η ηθοποιός του «Game of Thrones» Esmé Bianco και μια ανώνυμη - κατέθεσαν αστικές αγωγές εναντίον του.
Μέχρι στιγμής, ένας δικαστής έχει απορρίψει μόνο την αγωγή της Walters τον Μάιο, σύμφωνα με πληροφορίες, λόγω παραγραφής.

Marilyn Manson reveals he's 'getting death threats' and 'career is in gutter' since sexual abuse accusations,"Marilyn Manson shares he is distraught and suffering in life and career since 15 accused him of sexual misconduct.
On November 16, Five-time Grammy nominee Marilyn Manson shared about the downfall of his career and troubles in life which have distraught him emotionally, reported from Daily Mail.
According to TMZ, Marilyn revealed in new legal documents that online death threats make him feel ""anxious, distraught, depressed, worried, frantic, and sleepless"" and he also worries about his second wife, Lindsay Usich's safety.
Marilyn also revealed that he was suspended by his record label and talent agency, and has been ""excluded from Hollywood social and business gatherings.""
The 53-year-old shock rocker further shares that his music isn't doing very well, he can't tour, nor can he publish a book. He also shares that his paintings have been ""devalued,"" and his art shows have been ""indefinitely postponed.""
Marilyn said that his ""false portrayal as a rapist, abuser, and child pornographer"" has also caused him to lose two acting roles, the Starz series American Gods and Paramount+ series The Stand.
The series of allegations against Marilyn began in February 2021, when his former fiancée Evan Rachel Wood accused him of ""emotionally, physically, and sexually abusing"" her during their seven-month relationship.
Evan Rachel Woods' allegations have been featured in detail in Amy J. Berg's two-part docuseries Phoenix Rising, which premiered in March 2022 on HBO.",2022-11-15T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

The TikTok video showed Madonna standing in what appeared to be a bathroom with a large claw-foot tub behind her.
The 64-year-old had bright pink underwear in her hand, holding them up for viewers.
Text over the video read: ""If I miss, I'm gay!""
The hitmaker went to toss the panties and did, in fact, miss the trash can.
The award-winning musician did not add any more context to the clip.
Fans flooded the comments with questions, as well as shows of support.
""Did I just witness Madonna coming out? Good for her,"" one fan wrote.
Another supporter commented: ""Did Madonna just come out? And I'm witnessing it in real time?""
Someone else wrote: ""Coming out at 64?""
""Madonna has been an out bisexual for literally decades my dudes,"" another fan speculated.
A fifth fan joked: ""I'm witnessing history.""
""Why am I witnessing Madonna's coming out in real time?"" another wondered.
Other commenters were focused on her appearance, which has changed in a major way.
MODELING MARILYN
Just prior to her apparent coming out post, Madonna shared a video of herself sporting a drastically different look.
Her brows in the face-forward clip were dyed blonde and her hair was bright pink.
Music played in the background of the video and Madonna did not speak.
She moved slightly, staring into the lens all the while.
Fans compared her to singer Marilyn, noting similarities in their appearance.
One user commented: ""Marilyn Manson vibes.""
Another questioned: ""What in the beautiful people is going on here? Marilyn Manson?""
""Looks like Marilyn Manson,"" one person agreed.
Madonna has not yet responded to any of the chatter about her.
CALLING IT QUITS
In April, she and her boyfriend Ahlamalik Williams called it quits after three years together.
Ahlamalik, 28, is a professional dancer and choreographer.
He comes from California and is trained in a variety of dance styles including hip-hop.
Madonna told friends that she was single again after deciding that things with Ahlamalik were not working out, a source told The U.S. Sun at the time.
The insider revealed: “Madonna has thrown herself into a busy social life and has been seeing her friends and family after the split,”
""She has a packed schedule, working on her upcoming biopic, new music and looking after her family.”
The source added that things have been “on and off” with Ahlamalik “for a while,"" but there is still “a lot of love” between them, but they have ultimately “decided to separate.”
She has not been romantically linked to anyone else.

"Marilyn Manson : accusé d'agression sexuelle, il lance l'offensive contre son ex","1/3 - Marilyn Manson Dans une récente interview, Marilyn Manson a déclaré que son ex-compagne, Evan Rachel Wood, avait produit une fausse lettre du FBI mentionnant qu'une enquête pour agression sexuelle était en cours contre le chanteur.
Dans une récente interview, Marilyn Manson a déclaré que son ex-compagne, Evan Rachel, avait produit une fausse lettre du FBI mentionnant qu'une enquête pour agression sexuelle était en cours contre le chanteur. La rock star a décidé de porter plainte pour diffamation.
Les affaires devant la justice, Marilyn Manson connaît. Alors lorsqu'elle juge qu'elle n'a rien fait de mal, la rock star n'hésite pas à contre-attaquer. Et cette fois-ci, c'est son ex-compagne, Evan Rachel, qui s'apprête à en faire les frais. La raison ? Le chanteur l'accuse, elle et sa nouvelle compagne, Illma Gore, d'avoir inventé une lettre du FBI insinuant qu'une enquête pour agression sexuelle était en cours contre Marilyn Manson pour ""inciter de nombreuses femmes à porter plainte"" contre lui.
Au sein de cette lettre, l'actrice et sa nouvelle compagne se seraient fait passer pour un agent du FBI afin de créer ""un faux buzz"" en racontant que les victimes présumées de Marilyn Manson et leurs familles seraient en danger. Lors de son passage au poste de police pour déposer sa plainte, la rock star a déclaré que ces fausses allégations à son encontre avaient ""fait dérailler sa carrière musicale, télévisuelle et cinématographique"". L'avocat de Marilyn Manson, Maître Jackson Trugman, a déclaré ""avoir la preuve que Mlle Wood et Mlle Gore ont collaboré à l'écriture de cette lettre"".
Le procès de Marilyn Manson et d'Evan Rachel devrait se dérouler le 1er décembre
Ces dernières ont rapidement nié les accusations contre elles. Selon le juge en charge de cette affaire, une déposition de la défense doit être validée avant le 27 octobre pour que l'audience du procès puisse se dérouler le 1er décembre. Lors de ses explications pour prouver la véracité de ses propos, Marilyn Manson a expliqué que Evan Rachel Wood avait créé une fausse adresse électronique à son nom, avant d'envoyer des contenus de ""pornographie explicite"" pour tenter de créer des preuves de toutes pièces.
Selon le chanteur, l'actrice aurait en plus de cela piraté son ordinateur personnel, son téléphone portable et son adresse mail afin de récupérer plusieurs de ses mots de passe afin de créer de nombreuses ""preuves totalement fausses"". Mais la nouvelle compagne d'Evan Rachel Wood aurait décidé de contre-attaquer en affirmant que Marilyn Manson avait fait subir ""un lavage de cerveau à son ex pour la manipuler et la soumettre pendant de longues années"". Pour le moment, l'enquête suit son cours. Il est évidemment impossible de savoir qui dit vrai dans l'histoire. Mais une chose est sûre : nous entendrons reparler de cette affaire très prochainement.
Pour rappel, Evan Rachel Wood avait déjà déposé une plainte contre Marilyn Manson, mentionnant un abus de pouvoir et des sévices sexuels réguliers. L'actrice a notamment reproché à la rock star de l'avoir violée sur scène, alors que lui se défend en disant qu'elle avait toujours été consentante. Avec une vie si spéciale, on ne saura probablement jamais la véracité de toute cette histoire, même s'il a de nombreuses casseroles : une de ses anciennes assistantes avait également porté plainte contre le chanteur.",2022-10-03T12:35:25Z,https://www.closermag.fr,Closer France
Marilyn Manson's Sexual Assault Case Submitted To L.A. District Attorney,"The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Special Victims Bureau has submitted its case involving Marilyn Manson and sexual assault allegations to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office for review. The prosecution says that will need more outstanding material before reaching a decision on criminal charges.
""On September 19, 2022, investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department provided partial case material to LADA pertaining to the sexual assault allegations against Brian Warner, also known as Marilyn Manson,"" the D.A.'s office said in a statement provided to Pitchfork.

The statement continued: ""There is more material that is still outstanding, however, we do not have a timeline for the additional submission from the LASD. Once we receive everything, experienced prosecutors will carefully and deliberatively review everything that has been submitted prior to making a filing decision. This review will take some time but rest assured our office takes these allegations very seriously. LADA is dedicated to providing care and assistance to all victims of sexual assault, abuse, and intimate partner violence.""
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department's investigation into Marilyn Manson began after Evan Rachel Wood accused him of being abusive for years. Manson is also facing a federal lawsuit from actress Esmé Bianco for sexual assault and sexual battery.
The investigation is focused on allegations stemming from 2009 to 2011.
Manson's lawyer has called the allegations “provably false.”

L’enquête sur Marilyn Manson transmise aux procureurs,"Après 19 mois de travail, l’enquête concernant les allégations d’agression sexuelle à l’endroit de Marilyn Manson a été confiée cette semaine aux procureurs, qui décideront si des accusations doivent être portées contre le chanteur américain de 53 ans.

Dans une déclaration publiée mardi, le bureau du procureur du comté de Los Angeles a toutefois indiqué que le matériel fourni par les enquêteurs était « partiel ».
« Lorsque nous aurons tout reçu, des procureurs expérimentés examineront attentivement et délibérément tout ce qui a été soumis avant de prendre une décision », a indiqué le bureau du procureur dans une déclaration transmise mardi aux médias américains.
Le département du shérif du comté de Los Angeles n’a pas précisé le nom des victimes allégées, qui auraient été agressées entre 2009 et 2011, mais plusieurs femmes ayant côtoyé Marilyn Manson ont dénoncé ses comportements au cours des deux dernières années.
En février 2021, son ex-conjointe, l’actrice Evan Rachel Wood a soutenu sur Instagram avoir été « agressée de façon horrible pendant des années » par le chanteur, qui a entrepris contre elle une poursuite en diffamation. L’actrice Esmé Bianco, connue pour son rôle de Ros dans Game of Thrones, poursuit Marilyn Manson au civil pour agression sexuelle. C’est aussi le cas de trois autres femmes.
Personnage sombre et controversé, Marlyn Manson, de son vrai nom Brian Hugh Warner, a connu la gloire au milieu des années 1990 avec les albums Portrait of an American Family, Antichrist Superstar et Mechanical Animals.

Marilyn Manson: More Evidence Needed to Pursue Sexual Assault Charges,"Detectives have handed the results of their 19-month investigation into sexual assault allegations against Marilyn Manson to prosecutors, who said Tuesday (Sept. 20) they need more evidence gathered before they can consider criminal charges.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement that on Monday their investigators handed off the case, which involves sex assault and domestic violence allegations dating from 2009 to 2011 against the 53-year-old rocker, to the District Attorney’s Office.
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
The office called the case it received “partial.”
“Once we receive everything, experienced prosecutors will carefully and deliberatively review everything that has been submitted prior to making a filing decision,” the office said in a statement. “This review will take some time but rest assured our office takes these allegations very seriously.”
Representatives for Manson, whose legal name is Brian Hugh Warner, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but his attorney has called the allegations “provably false.”
The investigation included a November search of Manson’s home in West Hollywood, where media devices and other items were seized. Authorities have not identified the women involved, but several have publicly alleged that they were physically, sexually and emotionally abused by Manson around the time of the incidents under investigation, and some have filed civil lawsuits. They include Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco, whose attorney said she also gave interviews to law enforcement. Manson is himself suing his former fiancée, Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, whose February 2021 Instagram post alleging he had “horrifically abused me for years” set off the wave of public allegations against him.
The suit calls her assault allegations fabricated, and said she and another woman used false pretenses including a phony letter from the FBI to convince other women to come forward.
Wood’s attorneys said in court documents that the suit is meritless, and an example of the retaliation Manson long threatened Wood with if she spoke out about his abuse.
Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like “The Beautiful People” and hit albums like 1996’s Antichrist Superstar and 1998’s Mechanical Animals.

Officier van justitie bekijkt onderzoek naar Marilyn Manson,"De politie van Los Angeles heeft het onderzoek naar het vermeende seksueel misbruik van Marilyn Manson afgerond. Volgens de Los Angeles Times liggen de bevindingen nu bij de officier van justitie. Daar wordt gekeken of er aanleiding is om de zanger aan te klagen.
De politie deed de afgelopen negentien maanden onderzoek naar meerdere beschuldigingen van seksueel wangedrag. De vermeende incidenten vonden plaats tussen 2009 en 2011. ""Zodra we de zaak hebben ontvangen, zal deze zorgvuldig worden geëvalueerd door ervaren aanklagers om te bepalen of het gepast is om op dit moment een aanklacht in te dienen"", zei de openbaar aanklager er eerder over.
Meerdere vrouwen hebben de Amerikaanse shockrocker (53) beschuldigd van seksueel misbruik. Een van hen is actrice Evan Rachel Wood, een ex van Manson. De zanger, die alle aantijgingen ontkent, klaagde Wood aan voor onder meer smaad.
Tegen Manson loopt ook een federale zaak in Los Angeles. Actrice Esmé Bianco klaagde de zanger aan voor onder meer aanranding.",2022-09-20T21:28:32Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen

Marilyn Manson Sexual Abuse Investigation Submitted to Los Angeles D.A.,"Since February 2021, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Special Victims Bureau has been investigating sexual assault allegations involving Marilyn Manson. Detectives with the bureau have now officially submitted the case to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office for review and complaint filing consideration. A representative for Manson declined to comment on the development when reached by Pitchfork.
Last week, on September 12, George Gascón, the district attorney of Los Angeles County, gave an update on the investigation of Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner. “The Brian Warner matter is still under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, and has not yet been submitted to our office,” he said in a video. “Please be assured that we are requesting regular updates on the status of the investigation.”
“The district attorney is committed to investing in trauma-informed care for all victims of sexual assault, abuse and intimate partner violence,” Gascón continued. “We understand how difficult it may be to come forward as a victim, especially when the case involves this level of notoriety, and are dedicated to treating all victims with the highest levels of care and respect.”
The district attorney concluded, “Once we have received the case, it will be carefully evaluated by an experienced prosecutor to determine if it is appropriate to file charges at this time. We are hopeful that the LASD will present the case to us sometime this month.”
The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department opened its investigation after Evan Rachel Wood accused Marilyn Manson of abuse. Investigators explained that they were looking into “incidents [that] occurred between 2009 and 2011 when Mr. Warner lived in the city of West Hollywood.” In November 2021, the department executed a search warrant on an address associated with Manson.
Manson is currently facing a federal lawsuit from actress Esmé Bianco, who accused the musician of sexual assault and sexual battery. Manson is also suing Evan Rachel Wood for defamation.

Grito de la Independencia,"El Día de la Independencia de México está próxima a celebrarse y en distintos estados del país se están realizando diferentes actividades. Un adorno de Miguel Hidalgo, el “Padre de la Patria”, se hizo viral en Tepotzotlán por una particularidad: su gran parecido con el controvertido cantante Marilyn Manson. La fotografía se volvió viral en las redes sociales.
Solo faltan unas cuantas horas para que se conmemore en México el “Grito de Independencia”, por lo que ya se programaron diferentes actividades en el país azteca. En los colegios, por ejemplo, se recrearon las escenas históricas, algo que no pasó desapercibido en las redes sociales. Una muestra de ella se dio en Chiapas, en una escuela rural, donde los usuarios destacaron el ingenio de los estudiantes.
En Tepotzotlán, una localidad y cabecera municipal del municipio homónimo en el Estado de México, los ciudadanos no quisieron estar ajenos a las celebraciones y adornaron hace unos días sus calles con figuras de los héroes que participaron en la Independencia de México, según resalta Milenio.
Precisamente, uno de los adornos llamó mucho la atención: Miguel Hidalgo, el denominado el “Padre de la Patria”. Sin embargo, la figura no resaltó por su belleza, sino por su parecido con el cantante estadounidense Marilyn Manson.
“¡Viva Marilyn Manson!”
Un usuario de Twitter tomó una fotografía al peculiar adorno y lo publicó en la red social el pasado 5 de septiembre. La imagen no tardó en viralizarse y, hasta la fecha, acumuló más de 14 mil ‘me gusta’.
La reacción de los usuarios no se hizo esperar y más de uno hizo bromas. “¡Viva Marilyn Manson y sus músicos que nos dieron patria! ¿Esta joya independentista en qué localidad se encuentra?”; “¡Espera, es Bad Bunny! ¡Se alisó el cabello!”, fueron algunos de los comentarios destacados.

“The district attorney is committed to investing in trauma-informed care for all victims of sexual assault, abuse and intimate partner violence,” Gascón said.
“We understand how difficult it may be to come forward as a victim, especially when the case involves this level of notoriety, and are dedicated to treating all victims with the highest level of care and respect.”

After the sheriff’s department submits its finding, the district attorney’s office will decide if it is “appropriate” to file charges, Gascón said.

Manson, born Brian Warner, is under investigation for multiple accusations of domestic violence. The sheriff’s department opened the case in February 2021, citing alleged incidents between 2009 and 2011, and conducted a raid in November, seizing hard drives from his Hollywood home, a spokesperson previously confirmed to the Daily News.
At least six women have accused Manson of abuse, including actress Evan Rachel Wood, who began dating the rocker in 2007 when she was 19 and he was 38. The “Westworld” actress had long spoken of an abusive ex, but only identified him as Manson last year.
“My experience with domestic violence was this: Toxic mental, physical and sexual abuse which started slow but escalated over time, including threats against my life, severe gaslighting and brainwashing, waking up to the man that claimed to love me raping what he believed to be my unconscious body,” she told the House judiciary subcommittee in 2018.
Wood also told the California Senate that her abuser would tie her up, beat her and shock her.

“He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” she wrote on Instagram last year. “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander or blackmail.”
Her documentary about her experiences, “Phoenix Rising,” premiered on HBO in March.
“Game of Thrones” actress Esmé Bianco sued Manson last year, accusing him of using “drugs, force, and threats of force to coerce sexual acts.”

“These acts include spanking, biting, cutting, and whipping Ms. Bianco’s buttocks, breasts, and genitals for Mr. Warner’s sexual gratification — all without the consent of Plaintiff,” the lawsuit reads.
She also claimed he raped her, electrocuted her and beat her with a Nazi whip.
Bianco also accused Manson and manager Tony Ciulla of human trafficking for luring her from London to Los Angeles with the false promise of an acting job.
Manson has denied all allegations against him and sued Wood and another accuser, artist Illma Gore, for defamation, fraud and conspiracy.",2022-09-13T04:00:00Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News
Why Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson Covered the Song Together,"In 2018, Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson covered The Beatles‘ “Helter Skelter.” Zombie said the reason why they didn’t record the song earlier was because it was so “obvious” that neither of them thought to cover it. In addition, Zombie discussed what he thought about the track as a child.

Charles Manson impacted how Rob Zombie listens to The Beatles’ ‘The White Album’
In his 1998 book The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, Manson wrote his stage name derives from Charles Manson and Marilyn Monroe. He said his stage name was supposed to represent the duality of humanity. In his view, the former and the latter both had good sides and evil sides.
The Manson Family infamously took inspiration from The Beatles’ songs such as “Helter Skelter.” During a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone, Zombie discussed the song. “For anyone my age you really cannot listen to The White Album or ‘Helter Skelter’ without the Charles Manson connection,” he said. “That’s all I associate it with, ever since I was a little kid.”

Rob Zombie decided to he and Marilyn Manson should cover The Beatles’ ‘Helter Skelter’ after they talked with each other
Subsequently, Zombie discussed why he and Manson covered “Helter Skelter” around the time they went on tour together in 2018. “We had been talking about doing something together for these shows — that he should come onstage during my set and we’d do a song,” he revealed. “But we couldn’t think of what song. After we talked, later that night I was home and I just thought, ‘The obvious song is ‘Helter Skelter’ … It’s so obvious that neither one of us thought of it!'”
Zombie explained why he and Manson recorded the cover. “And then I figured, well, rather than us just doing it onstage, why don’t we take it one step further and record it and put a new spin on it?” he added. “That way, rather than just doing some impromptu jam together, now the fans will go, ‘Oh, there’s the song I’ve already heard, and now they’re doing it.'”

How ‘Helter Skelter’ and ‘The White Album’ performed on the pop charts in the United States and the United Kingdom
The Beatles’ “Helter Skelter” was never a single, so it did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Its parent album, The White Album, was a huge hit. It topped the Billboard 200 for nine weeks, staying on the chart 215 weeks in total.
The Official Charts Company says “Helter Skelter” did not chart in the United Kingdom. On the other hand, The White Album was No. 1 in the U.K. for eight weeks. The White Album remained on the chart for 37 weeks altogether.
“Helter Skelter” had a disturbing history — but that didn’t stop Zombie and Manson from covering it.

Gegen Wood ging Marilyn Manson mit einer Klage wegen Verleumdung vor. Diese liess sich das nicht bieten und packte im Interview mit dem US-Sender ABC über die Horror-Beziehung aus. Im Interview meinte sie unter anderem: «Ich mache das nicht, um meinen Namen reinzuwaschen, sondern um Menschen zu beschützen.

Marilyn Manson scheint seine besten Zeiten bereits hinter sich zu haben. Neue Fotos zeigen den Schockrocker ungeschminkt in einem schlechten Zustand.
Los Angeles – Vor einigen Jahren sorgte Marilyn Manson (53) noch mit seiner Musik für Aufsehen. Heute macht der exzentrisch aufgemachte Schockrocker eher mit zahlreichen Vorwürfen wegen angeblicher sexueller Gewalt Schlagzeilen. Nachdem Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (34), die einige Zeit mit Manson liiert war, ihn in einem Social-Media-Statement des Missbrauchs bezichtigte, gingen auch andere Frauen mit ihren Geschichten über den Musiker an die Öffentlichkeit. Neben Wood klagte auch die ehemalige „Game of Thrones“-Darstellerin Esmé Bianco (40) vor Gericht gegen Manson.
Die Vorwürfe sowie die öffentlichen Reaktionen auf die News scheinen nicht spurlos an Marilyn Manson vorbeizugehen. Als er vergangene Woche bei einem Spaziergang in der Millionenstadt Los Angeles von Fotografen abgelichtet wurde, sah der „Personal Jesus“-Interpret denkbar schlecht aus. Wie Mail Online berichtet, wirkte Manson ohne sein typisches Make-up aufgedunsen und ungesund. Die Bilder lassen ihn um einiges älter als bei seinen letzten Auftritten erscheinen.
Marilyn Manson muss sich wegen der Missbrauchsvorwürfe vor Gericht verantworten
Marilyn Manson ist auf den neuesten Paparazzi-Schnappschüssen nur schwer wiederzuerkennen. Neben den Missbrauchsvorwürfen musste sich der Sänger in der Vergangenheit auch immer wieder wegen seines angeblichen Alkohol- und Drogenskonsums rechtfertigen. Ob sein schlechter Zustand möglicherweise auch damit zu tun hat, bleibt allerdings Spekulation.
Fest steht, dass der Marilyn Mansons Ruf ziemlich unter den Anklagen gelitten hat. Evan Rachel Wood erklärte in einem Interview, dass es ihr keinesfalls darum gehe, ihren Bekanntheitsgrad zu steigern. „Ich mache das nicht, um meinen Namen reinzuwaschen, sondern um Menschen zu beschützen. Ich mache das, um zu warnen, dass da draußen eine gefährliche Person rumläuft und ich möchte nicht, dass ihr jemand zu nahe kommt“, sagte Wood.",2022-08-16T16:19:00Z,https://www.tz.de,tz.de

Hat er die Schock-Rocker-Visage schon satt?
Marilyn Manson (53, bürgerlich: Brian Hugh Warner) spaziert ohne Make-up durch Los Angeles. Er wirkt im Gesicht aufgedunsen und im gänzlich düsteren Outfit noch immer etwas gruselig.
Was jeder sehen kann: Nach den Missbrauchsvorwürfen mehrerer Ex-Freundinnen ist der Skandal-Rocker auch ungeschminkt ziemlich blass um die Nase.
Mit seiner Frau Lindsay Usich (37) bummelte Manson vergangene Woche durch Hollywood, ganz ohne dramatische Schminke. Komplett in Schwarz gekleidet mit Mantel, T-Shirt, weiter Hose und Lederstiefeln ging er beinahe unscheinbar mit seiner Liebsten aus.
Manson im alten Schock-Rocker-Style
Statt kräftigem Augen-Make-up trug er lediglich eine Sonnenbrille. Die diente aber wohl mehr als Schutz vor Fotografen, denn die Sonne war zum Zeitpunkt seines Dinner-Dates längst untergegangen.
Ein Video der „ Daily Mail“ zeigt, wie am Abend vor dem Restaurant bereits einige Fans und Reporter warteten.
Ein Fotograf fragte Manson: „Lange nicht gesehen. Wie geht es dir?“ Der Musiker antwortete kurz: „Gut, Mann“ und schrieb dann geduldig Autogramme.
Marilyn Manson und die Fotografin Lindsay Usich sind seit 2020 verheiratet
Seit den Vergewaltigungsvorwürfen seiner Ex-Frau Evan Rachel Wood (34) hat sich Manson zurückgezogen. Zuletzt wurde er im November 2021 bei Kanye Wests (45) Gottesdienst „Sunday Service“ gesehen. Da noch mit typisch grellem Make-up.
Die beiden hatten auch für Kanyes Alben DONDA und DONDA 2 zusammengearbeitet. Der Kim-Kardashian-Ex soll einer der wenigen Künstler sein, die noch gemeinsame Pläne mit dem Skandal-Rocker haben.

Die Anschuldigungen gegen Manson scheinen West egal zu sein. Drei ehemalige Liebhaberinnen des Rockers beschuldigen ihn des Missbrauchs und der Vergewaltigung. Insgesamt meldeten sich mindestens 15 Frauen wegen angeblicher sexueller Übergriffe durch Manson. Er selbst bestreitet bisher alle Vorwürfe, verklagte sogar seine Ex Evan Rachel Wood wegen Verleumdung.
Das Los Angeles Police Department bestätigte Ende Mai gegenüber „ TMZ“, dass es zwar eine Untersuchung gegen Manson eingeleitet hatte. Aufgrund „einiger Glaubwürdigkeitsprobleme mit dem Opfer“ würde es aber wahrscheinlich nicht zur Klage kommen.",2022-08-15T13:29:26Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD

Marilyn Manson looked unrecognisable as he broke cover in Hollywood alongside his wife Lindsay Usich amid ongoing civil sexual assault claims - which he categorically denies.
The singer, 53, has been keeping an incredibly low profile after his former girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood claimed that he was 'abusive' towards her.
The heavy metal singer was spotted out and about with his 37-year-old girlfriend, Lindsay, in Hollywood on Wednesday night where he looked almost unrecognisable without his signature black eyeshadow look.
Marilyn, whose real name Brian Warner, was spotted sporting an all black ensemble while walking the streets of Hollywood.
He was photographed wearing a long black leather coat coat, and underneath, the singer wore a t-Shirt, baggy black pants, and heavy-duty leather boots.

In his hands, Marilyn carried a pair of black sunglasses amid the ongoing sexual assault and rape claims.
The singer is currently facing lawsuits from three women - Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco, model Ashley Morgan Smithine and an unnamed woman who have all made sexual assault claims.
The Sweet Dreams hit-maker is also suing ex Evan Rachel Wood for defamation following several claims aired in a documentary in January where she alleged that the singer 'raped her' after she aborted their child.
Evan, 34, alleged that she was 'horrifically abused her for years' by Manson throughout their relationship from 2006 to 2010.

As a result, Manson filed a defamation lawsuit at the LA Superior Court against allegations of sexual assault and emotional abuse which Evan made against him - something which he categorically denies.
However, actress said she would stop at no lengths to 'expose the dangerous man' which she claims Manson is.
Responding to the lawsuit, the actress said she was confident the 'truth will come out'.
Speaking on The View, ahead of the release of her documentary Phoenix Rising: Don't Fall, she said: ""I can't, obviously, speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I am not scared.
Meanwhile, Manson has claimed in his suit that Wood and artist Illma Gore had come up with a 'conspiracy' to smear him as a'""rapist and abuser' in order to sabotage his 'successful music, TV, and film career'.

And in response to this, Wood has claimed that her ex's tactics are part of the systemic issues of people in power silencing accusers.
""I am sad, because this is how it works, this is what pretty much every survivor that tries to expose someone in a position of power goes through, and this is part of the retaliation that keeps survivors quiet,"" she told.
""This is why people don't want to come forward, because this is - this was expected.""
She also said she was undaunted by the allegations brought against her by the artist in his suit.
""I am very confident that I have the truth on my side and that the truth will come out, and that this is clearly timed before the documentary - this is the reason.
""So yes, again, I'm not doing this to clear my name, I'm doing this to protect people. I'm doing this to sound the alarm that there's a dangerous person out there and I don't want anybody getting near him.
""People can think whatever they want about me, I have to let the legal process run its course. And I'm steady as a rock.""
The True Blood actress has also accused ex-boyfriend Mansion of drugging her with sleeping pills at times during their relationship and claims he would use it as an opportunity to sleep with her while she was unconscious.
""This is also when he started raping me in my sleep,"" she says.

""I’d wake up, I just remember doing the mental math quickly and thinking, Just stay, just stay asleep, don’t move, just don’t move'. So I would just lie limp and still until it was over, and then I swear to God, he would just fling my leg and walk out of the room.""
Manson has since been accused of sexual assault by at least 15 other women, and has denied all the claims.

Κατά την έξοδό του ο 53χρονος τραγουδιστής της ροκ, του οποίου το πραγματικό όνομα είναι Brian Hugh Warner – έμοιαζε αγνώριστος, καθώς δεν φορούσε το μακιγιάζ που συνηθίζει, ενώ έδειχνε ότι έχει πάρει βάρος.

Marilyn was seen out with his 37-year-old partner as they went out in Hollywood, California on Wednesday night.
The controversial star appeared bloated as he sported a typical all black ensemble including coat, T-Shirt, baggy pants, and leather boots.
Usich, meanwhile, rocked a black cardigan, a green dress and matching black booties.
She could be seen clutching a small black Chanel bag as she joined her beau on the evening outing.
It is one of the rare occasions the couple have been spotted together since their honeymoon in Berlin last year.
It came shortly after his home was raided by the Los Angeles County sheriff’s department in November 2021 after the Special Victims Unit obtained search warrants.
Manson is currently facing lawsuits from three women, including Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco, model Ashley Morgan Smithine and a Jane Doe.
The singer is also suing ex Evan Rachel Wood for defamation following several claims aired in a documentary in January.
Last year, Evan claimed her ex-fiancé ""horrifically abused her for years"" and said she was desperate to ""expose this dangerous man.""
And in the doc she accused Manson, 53, of raping her on his music video set in 2007.
She was reportedly ""coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretences,"" and had only agreed to a “simulated sex scene,"" according to a documentary about her life and career, which premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival.
In the film, Wood claimed that Manson “started penetrating me for real” once the cameras were rolling,"" The Guardian reports.
“I had never agreed to that,” she said. “I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses. That’s when the first crime was committed against me and I was essentially raped on camera.”
She has also accused the star of grooming her.
While Esme previously claimed the rock star had tied her down and whipped her, electrocuted her and cut her with a knife.
She also alleges that he assaulted her during sex, and that he once chased her around with an axe in their apartment.
In an interview with the Cut, she said that her experiences left her with ""physical scars"" and suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
Manson has vehemently denied the allegations and insisted all his romantic relationships have been ""entirely consensual.""
In a statement previously posted on Instagram, he said: ""Obviously, my life and my art have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""

"After Amber Heard And Johnny Depp Trial, Some Online Users Pivoting To Following Marilyn Manson And Evan Rachel Wood Defamation Lawsuit","There’s another defamation case currently playing out. Following the verdict in the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial , interest in celebrity lawsuits still seems to be at a high. For those keeping tabs, another defamation suit has been filed by Marilyn Manson after his ex Evan Rachel Wood accused the singer of abuse years after speaking out in front of a judiciary committee as a victim of abuse. Online social media users seem to be trending toward following the happenings of this new suit, particularly after a 6,000 page unsealed doc was released in the Depp case which also brought Manson to the forefront.
We already know there was high interest in the Amber Heard and Johnny Depp trial when it played out. Fans on TikTok became so engrossed in the trial, Depp created a TikTok to thank the fans for their support after it ended. Deep dives of the Manson/Wood case are also being done on TikTok and elsewhere and seeing thousands of views.
Many Twitter and YouTube users also gained followings during the trial, with a report over at Insider citing several accounts that were interested in and blew up during the events of the Heard and Depp case now pivoting to Marilyn Manson.
That outlet also recently spoke with Rachel Gevlin, who teaches at the UK-based Birmingham-Southern College and who said she would not be surprised to see similar things happen with Marilyn Manson and Evan Rachel Wood should that particular case play out in court. Her reasoning?
There's a centuries-long history of readers who enjoy hearing the salacious details of the rich and famous.
Emphasizing this possibility further is the fact that Marilyn Manson and Johnny Depp know one another and the singer's name came up in the other case. Manson never took the stand; however, text messages Johnny Depp had sent him played a role in the recently unsealed documents. In court, Depp was even asked about his relationship with Manson , noting they “done drugs together” a few times. Some of the same audience that was interested in the Depp/Heard trial could be interested in this case.
Similar to Amber Heard getting trolled during and after she fought with her ex in court, a petition already exists to ban Evan Rachel Wood from social media, though it’s worth noting its thousand plus signatures pales in comparison to petitions about Amber Heard. One petition requesting Amber Heard be removed from Aquaman 2 has garnered over 4.6 million signatures.
In a separate interview over at Indiewire, #MeToo attorney Lee Feldman told that outlet that the Manson situation could play out very differently given the accusations and how the singer is perceived in pop culture.
I think that the Marilyn Manson case is going to be a different situation. Marilyn Manson is not Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp is well-liked and almost a beloved figure in some circles. His movies generated billions of dollars and he has legions of fans. Marilyn Manson’s fan base is very particular and very limited. He’s not somebody who has widespread public support in the way that Johnny Depp does.",2022-08-10T20:57:53Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Marilyn Manson Fans Push Online Campaign to Discredit Evan Rachel Wood,"Marilyn Manson sued his ex-girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood for defamation after she accused him of rape and abuse.
In February 2021, actor Evan Rachel Wood released an explosive statement in which she accused her ex-boyfriend, singer Marilyn Manson (real name Brian Warner), of grooming and abusing her during the course of their relationship. Manson denied the claims in an Instagram statement saying his intimate relationships have ""always been entirely consensual.""
The pair met in 2005 when Wood was 19 and Manson was 36. They confirmed they were dating in 2007 and had a tumultuous, on-and-off relationship until 2010, when they broke up following an engagement.
In the subsequent years, Wood spoke publicly about being sexually assaulted and abused, but did not name a perpetrator. Following her statement accusing Manson last year, the singer was dropped by his record label and cut from two acting projects, Deadline reported.
Now, Manson is suing Wood for defamation, following the lead of his close friend Johnny Depp, who filed a similar suit against his ex-wife and accuser Amber Heard. Depp's defamation case against Heard dominated the cultural conversation earlier this year.
Manson is likely hoping he sees the same treatment as Depp, who was largely perceived as the winning party thanks in part to how his fans mobilized on social media and pushed the narrative that Heard lied about the accusations.
Depp's supporters on social media — bolstered by TikTok and Instagram algorithms, drowned out those who backed Heard.
After the trial concluded — finding for both parties but awarding Depp $15 million in damages compared to $2 million for Heard — public perception shifted slightly. In the months since, many have come to believe that the treatment of Heard on social media and in mainstream media was toxic and potentially damaging to people who speak out about abuse experienced at the hands of powerful men.
The pro-Depp contingent has remained vocal about their support for the actor; they continue to argue he was the true victim of abuse in the relationship. And now that the Depp-Heard trial is over, they've begun using some of the same tactics that successfully discredited Amber Heard to do the same to Wood.

Unsealed Depp v. Heard court docs reveal ‘Aquaman’ actress was 'exotic dancer',"Newly unsealed court papers reveal that Amber Heard had a ""brief stint as an exotic dancer,"" and her ex-husband Johnny Depp did not want his friendship with disgraced rocker Marilyn Manson outed at trial.
After Johnny Depp won his defamation case against Amber Heard with a jury awarding him $10.35 million, Judge Penney Azcarate ordered the release of the secret documents on July 13.
The documents were published online over the weekend by legal commentator Andrea Burkhart, who crowd-sourced more than $3,300 to purchase the records.
The court papers detail the behind-the-scenes wrangling on both sides to try to get evidence admitted and kept out of the Fairfax County Circuit trial in Virginia.
A March 22 motion outlined Heard’s opposition to Depp’s team’s attempt to present damaging information about her past to the jury.
Heard's lawyer Elaine Bredehoft argued that Depp was trying to introduce ""irrelevant personal matters"" – including ""Amber’s brief stint as an exotic dancer years before she met Mr. Depp,"" nude pictures of her and ""unfounded allegations"" that she had worked as a sex worker.
""Nude pictures of Amber Heard or comments about stripping or escort services would be highly distracting and unfairly prejudicial to the extent they portray Amber Heard as a sex symbol instead of a women's rights activist against domestic abuse,"" Bredehoft wrote.

Heard’s team also fought to keep out Heard's sister Whitney Henriquez's ""reality show video."" None of these ""personal matters"" were introduced at trial.
A 965-page motion filed March 28 also revealed crude text messages between Depp and Marilyn Manson that were never presented to the jury.
Depp’s attorney, Ben Chew, aggressively fought to exclude any references to the actor's friendship with Manson, whose real names is Brian Warner, out of concern it would ""smear Mr. Depp under a guilty by association theory.""
Manson texted Depp in 2016 to say that Lindsay Usich ""pulled an Amber,"" in reference to Manson's now-wife Usich calling the cops on him and claiming he beat her up. He described her as ""Amber 2.0.""
Depp responded, ""I've been reading A LOT of material on that and sociopathic behavior…it is f—king real my brother!! My ex-c—-t is goddamn TEXTBOOK!!!.""
Manson was blacklisted in the music industry after a number of women accused him of physical, mental and sexual abuse — including his former fiancé ""Westworld"" actress Evan Rachel Wood. He sued her for defamation in March.
Although the vulgar texts did not come in during the trial, Manson’s name did repeatedly crop up with the ""Aquaman"" actress' team painting her then-husband as a drug addict who went on cocaine-fueled binges with the heavy metal rocker.
After the six-week trial, the seven-member panel found that Heard had defamed Depp by penning a Washington Post op-ed referring to herself as a victim of domestic abuse and awarded him $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive. The judge reduced the punitive damages award to $350,000 – the maximum allowed under Virginia law.
The jury awarded Heard $2 million in her countersuit, finding in her favor on a single claim that Depp’s attorney Adam Waldman had defamed her in a statement to the press calling her allegations a ""hoax.""
Both sides are appealing the verdict.

Phoebe Bridgers Likes Post Supporting Amber Heard After Document Release,"Singer Phoebe Bridgers liked a tweet defending Amber Heard following the actress' high-profile trial against her ex-husband, Johnny Depp.
Bridgers, 27, clicked the heart icon on a tweet from August 2 that read: ""When the tide turns for Amber, people will be too ashamed to admit that they partook in the mocking of an abuse victim. Instead they'll try to minimize the harm they caused to survivors. They'll say 'we were all manipulated' as if the information wasn't easily accessible.""
The post was written by a woman named Kamilla, who, according to her bio, is a survivor of IPV (intimate partner violence). At the time of publication, the tweet had more than 73,400 likes and over 12,000 retweets.
The note came after more than 6,000 pages of unsealed court documents from the former couple's legal battle were made public.
In 2020, the Pirates of the Caribbean star, 59, filed a $50 million defamation lawsuit against the Aquaman actress, 36, after she wrote in a 2018 op-ed for The Washington Post that she was a survivor of domestic violence. While Heard did not mention Depp by name, his legal team argued the implication impacted the actor's ability to be cast in movie roles. The following year, Heard filed a $100 million countersuit.
On June 1, a Fairfax County, Virginia jury found Heard guilty of defamation. Depp, who shares kids Lily-Rose and Jack Depp with ex Vanessa Paradis, was awarded $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. However, because state law limits punitive damages to $350,000 in Virginia, the actual amount the Kentucky native will receive is $10.35 million.
When the tide turns for Amber, people will be too ashamed to admit that they partook in the mocking of an abuse victim. Instead they’ll try to minimize the harm they caused to survivors. They’ll say “we were all manipulated” as if the information wasn’t easily accessible. — kamilla (@k4mil1aa) August 2, 2022
Heard received $2 million for her countersuit.
Bridgers previously vocalized her support for the women who came forward with abuse allegations against rocker Marilyn Manson. In February 2021, the ""Motion Sickness"" singer recounted her own experience with the now 53-year-old from when she was a teenager.
""TW [trigger warning]:"" Bridgers tweeted. ""I went to Marilyn Manson's house when I was a teenager with some friends. I was a big fan. He referred to a room in his house as the 'r*pe room,' I thought it was just his horrible frat boy sense of humor. I stopped being a fan. I stand with everyone who came forward.""
TW:
I went to Marilyn Manson’s house when I was a teenager with some friends. I was a big fan. He referred to a room in his house as the “r*pe room”, I thought it was just his horrible frat boy sense of humor. I stopped being a fan.

In the reply chain below her post, she added, ""The label knew, management knew, the band knew. Distancing themselves now, pretending to be shocked and horrified is f**king pathetic.""
Manson had been accused of abuse by numerous people, including his ex-partner, actress Evan Rachel Wood. He denied all allegations against him on Instagram.
""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,"" he wrote in February 2021. ""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how—and why—others are now choosing to misinterpret the past, that is the truth.""
The unsealed court documents from Depp's defamation trial revealed text messages between the actor and Manson, in which the musician said that ""I got an amber 2.0"" in relation to his then-girlfriend, now wife, Lindsay Usich. He had also reportedly messaged Depp in 2016 that his wife was ""pulling an Amber.""
Depp and Heard met on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary. They were married in February 2015 and split just 15 months later. Their divorce was finalized in January 2017.

Ce après quoi Marilyn a envoyé un texto à Johnny Depp lui disant : « Lindsay m’a fait une Amber… supprime s’il te plaît ».
Johnny Depp a alors répondu : « Te laisse pas faire. Le plus important est de rester calme et de ne pas lui donner ce qu’elle attend, c’est-à-dire te faire hurler, te rendre dingue, et nourrir son narcissisme. J’ai beaucoup lu sur le sujet et sur les comportements de sociopathe ».

"Em conversa com Depp, Marilyn Manson revela que ex chamou a polícia por agressão: ‘Amber 2.0’","Em conversa com Depp, Marilyn Manson revela que ex chamou a polícia por agressão: ‘Amber 2.0’
Em uma conversa por mensagens recém-exposta entre o músico Marilyn Manson e o ator Johnny Depp mostra o cantor revelando que sua atual esposa chamou a polícia e o acusou de agressão quando os dois ainda namoravam. O bate-papo aconteceu em 2016, quatro anos antes de Manson trocar alianças com a fotógrafa Lindsay Ursich.
A troca de mensagens consta documentação recém-revelada pela imprensa internacional que acabou descartada no processo de difamação movido por Johnny Depp contra a ex-esposa, a atriz e modelo Amber Heard. Segundo o site Daily Mail, o material envolvendo Manson teve seu uso como evidência apresentado pela equipe legal de Heard, mas acabou sendo proibido pelos advogados de Depp.
Em uma das mensagens para Depp, Manson afirma: “Eu tenho uma Amber 2.0”. Depois ele conta como a então namorada o acusou de agressão e de posse de drogas em casa. O astro da franquia ‘Piratas do Caribe’ se solidariza com o amigo e aconselha: “Não aceite nenhuma dessas merdas, fique calmo e não dê nada que ela pedir”.
O ator depois diz: “Comportamentos sociopatas… É para valer essa merda, meu irmão!! A c*zona da minha ex é a p***a de um exemplo vivo!!”. Ele também afirma: “O que ela quer é FAZER VOCÊ GRITAR, SURTAR COMPLETAMENTE E ALIMENTAR O NARCISISMO DELA!!!”. Ele então afirma que está lendo “MUITOS materiais sobre o tema” e concluiu afirmando: “Deveria ter me informado antes”.
Em outra troca de mensagens, Manson volta a reclamar da companheira, a chamando pelo apelido de “L”: “Eu tenho um cenário sério envolvendo a política do tipo Amber na família da L. Estou tenso demais. Não sei se você já voltou, mas preciso de abrigo em algum lugar porque acho que a polícia possa vir atrás de mim”.
O músico complementa: “A Lindsay deu uma de Amber e procurou a polícia. Ela segue fazendo a Amber e os policiais vão aparecer com um um mandado”. Depp volta a aconselhá-lo: “Mantenha a distância e fique o mais longe possível dela!!!”. O cantor então conclui dizendo: “Isso doentio. Disse que bati nela. Deu o meu endereço para a polícia. E disse que tenho droga aqui. Estou pronto para dar o fora”.
Em uma última mensagem, Manson diz que vai apresentar uma fã a Depp, informando que ela tem 18 anos: “Minha nova garota que conheci em um encontro com fãs. Parece que você está precisando. Confia em mim. Vou mandar uma foto. 18”.
Após o término de seu casamento com Depp, Heard o acusou de violência doméstica. A acusação resultou no processo de difamação vencido pelo ator no último mês de junho. A atriz foi condenada a pagar US$ 10,35 milhões em indenização e ele a pagar a ela pouco mais de US$ 2 milhões.
Em fevereiro de 2021 a atriz Evan Rachel expôs o nome de Manson como o autor de uma série de abusos psicológicos e sexuais conta ela. Ao acusar o ex-namorado, ela fez um post no Instagram afirmando: “O nome do meu abusador é Brian Warner, também conhecido como Marilyn Manson”. Ela tinha 19 anos quando trouxe a público o namoro com o músico, que tinha 37 anos na época. Juntos desde 2006, eles chegaram a noivar em janeiro de 2010, mas terminaram em agosto do mesmo ano.
Depois que Wood revelou os abusos, mais mulheres apareceram para acusar Manson de crimes sexuais. O músico nega as acusações.",2022-08-02T13:26:12Z,https://istoe.com.br,Istoe
"Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial Documents Unsealed: Marilyn Manson Texts, Salacious Photos And Other Material That The Jury Didn’t See Or Hear","The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial captivated viewers with a peek into the stormy marriage of two movie stars but, believe it or not, the proceedings could have been even more sensational.
The unsealing of a trove of 6,000 pages of documents has shown how both sides bitterly fought during the discovery stage of the trial over what could be admitted and what could not. Things were so acrimonious between the parties that there was even a long exchange between the attorneys over Covid safety precautions to be taken during Heard’s deposition.
From Heard’s point of view, Judge Penney Azcarate ended up excluding too much from the jury’s eyes and ears. After the jury awarded Depp $10.4 million in damages, her attorney Elaine Bredehoft appeared on Today and complained that the panel did not hear other evidence in the case that was allowed in Depp’s UK trial, where he lost his case against The Sun for a story that identified him as a “wife beater.” “We had an enormous amount of evidence that was suppressed in this case that was in the UK case,” Bredehoft said.
Heard won a $2 million judgment against Depp, and both sides are appealing their respective verdicts.
Neither the Depp or Heard camps responded to request for comment on the mass unsealing when contacted today by Deadline.
Among the details in the unsealed documents:
Metadata. While a Depp team witness suggested at trial that Heard’s photos of her injuries may have been edited, in line with the inference that they were doctored, Heard’s team also made a similar inference about photos submitted by Depp.Forsensic expert Julian Ackert cited “anomalies that call into question the authenticity of the documents.” Specifically, Heard’s team referred to the “limited metadata reveals the ‘Creation,’ ‘Modified,’ “Received,’ and “Sent’ Dates are July 22, 2019, despite Mr. Depp claiming this picture was taken in March 2015.” Depp’s team called the claims “irrelevant” and lacking in foundation. The judge denied the Heard team’s motions to pursue the matter further.
Salacious photos. Heard’s team claimed that Depp’s attorneys sought to introduce “irrelevant personal matters” such as nude photos of Heard and “Amber’s brief stint as an exotic dancer years before she met Mr. Depp and Mr. Depp attempting to frivolously and maliciously suggest or imply that Ms. Heard was at one time an escort.” They contended that the allegations she was an escort were “unfounded, incendiary, irrelevant, and designed to harass and demean Amber Heard.” Depp’s team wrote in March that they did not anticipate introducing such evidence, but that it was “possible to envision a scenario in which such photographs might become very relevant in the context of this case, for instance to show a lack of visible injuries.” They also referred to evidence of Heard’s stint as a stripper “or rumors that she was an escort early in her career.
“However, Mr. Depp reserves the right to use such materials to the extent that they become necessary on rebuttal, and in any event, trial is a fluid process, and these issues are all potentially relevant and should be reserved for final decision at trial.”
They were kept out of the trial.
Marilyn Manson texts. Depp’s friendship with Marilyn Manson was cited during the trial, but his attorneys worried about “guilt by association.” According to the New York Post, the unsealed records show that Manson texted Depp in 2016 that he was in an ”amber 2.0” situation. Depp texted back, “I been reading A LOT of material on that and sociopathic behavior…it is f—ing real my brother!! My ex c— is goddam TEXTBOOK!!!” “Ms. Heard’s attempt to smear Mr. Depp with an association with Mr. Manson is more prejudicial than it is probative,” Depp’s attorneys argued. The texts were withheld from the trial. Manson is engaged in his own defamation lawsuit, having sued ex fiancé Evan Rachel Wood and others over her abuse claims.
Depp’s medical history. The actor’s team acknowledged his history of substance abuse, but there were other part of his medical history that they sought to exclude. They argued that his medical condition was “marginal or no probative value.” An example: evidence that Depp took Valtrex, Nexium and Cialis.
If Heard won. At a November, 2020 deposition, Depp was asked by Heard’s attorney whether how he would react if the jury ruled in favor of his ex-wife and whether he would merely deem it the “opinion of seven people.”
“No, I’m not going to say that’s the opinion of seven people. Listen, it can be the opinion of one man, it can be the opinion of 200 people, it can be the opinion of a thousand people, and they could believe that I did do those things, which I did not take part in any of what Ms. Heard accuses me of. It is outright fiction, therefore I can only hope that people will hear the truth and understand it to be the truth, but I don’t think that the — the young soldiers who were storming the beaches of Normandy — I don’t think they were saying hey, let’s have pizza tonight. I think that they knew what they’d gone into.”
“So what I’m saying is if — if this does come out, the decision in this particular case comes out in … Ms. Heard’s favor, then that is what will happen, but that’s not going to make me go oh, my God, I must have done it.”",2022-08-02T04:24:09Z,https://deadline.com,Deadline
"Depp v. Heard trial: The 5 biggest new revelations, from omitting Marilyn Manson to submitting nudes","The Depp v. Heard trial continues to generate heated discussion, headlines and controversy months after its conclusion. And its latest revelations highlight just how much more of a circus the trial could've been.
To recap, on June 1, a jury at the Fairfax County Circuit Courthouse in Fairfax, Virginia, awarded actor Johnny Depp $10.35 million for defamation and actor Amber Heard, Depp's ex-wife, $2 million. Heard's payment was awarded after Depp was found liable for statements he had made. Depp's payment came about after Heard published an op-ed in the Washington Post on being an abuse survivor.
Though the op-ed did not name Depp or anyone as Heard's abuser, Depp sued Heard for defamation as a result of its publication. Heard then sued Depp for damages to her career, resulting in a lengthy, highly-contentious and publicized trial, including hours of testimony where both actors took the stand.
In early July, Heard's legal team requested a mistrial after it was revealed that one of the jurors on the case had not actually been called for jury duty and was impersonating another person who had been summoned. The motions for a mistrial were denied, though Heard still has the option to appeal.
This past weekend, documents in the Depp v. Heard case were unsealed. Totaling more than 6,000 pages, the documents reveal more details, arguments and twists in this lengthy and convoluted case. They offer new insights into what could have been.
Here are some of the more shocking revelations in the newly opened Depp v. Heard file.

Johnny Depp’s messages to Marilyn Manson have been sending fans into frenzy as unearthed court document came into light several weeks after the defamation trial.
According to the reports in New York Post, the unsealed court documents recently revealed that Depp weighed in on Amber Heard’s ‘sociopathic behaviour’.
In 2016, Manson messaged wrote to Depp, ""I got an amber 2.0"" and he added, “Lindsay just pulled an amber on me…please delete”
Depp texted back, “Most important is to stay calm and not give her what she wants, which is, TO MAKE YOU SCREAM, FLIP OUT AND FEED HER NARCISSISM!!!”
“I been reading A LOT of material on that and sociopathic behaviour…it is (expletive) real my brother!! My ex-(expletive) is goddamn TEXTBOOK!!!”

Marilyn Manson To Johnny Depp: Wife 'Pulled An Amber' In Unsealed Documents,"According to newly-unsealed court documents, Marilyn Manson texted Johnny Depp in 2016 to say that his girlfriend ""pulled an Amber.""
The shock rocker—whose real name is Brian Warner—allegedly messaged Depp, ""I got an amber 2.0."" in relation to his then-girlfriend, now wife, Lindsay Usich.
Thousands of pages of documents filed in the Depp v. Heard defamation case were unsealed over the weekend and published online.
The documents, which were seen by Newsweek, include text messages between the Pirates of the Caribbean actor and his friend Manson, who is also embroiled in a legal dispute with an ex-partner.
Evan Rachel Wood was sued for defamation by her ex-fiance after publicly alleging that she was subjected to domestic abuse at the hands of the musician during their relationship.
During the blockbuster trial of Depp and Heard earlier this year, Depp testified that he had taken recreational drugs with Manson and that they were friends.
Now, text messages between the pair discussing Heard and Manson's own partner Usich have been made public.
The unsealed documents include texts allegedly from Manson to Depp that said Usich filed a restraining order against him, alleging he ""beat her up"" and had drugs in his home.
""Lindsay just pulled an amber on me...please delete,"" another alleged text found the in court documents read.
In response, Depp allegedly advised Manson ""don't take no s**t"" and said it was important ""not to give her what she wants.""
Depp added, per the documents: ""Sociopathic behavior... it is f***ing real, my brother!! My ex-c**t is god**** TEXTBOOK!!""
Manson also apparently referenced a 2016 incident when police were called to Depp and Heard's Los Angeles home and texted Depp, per the filing: ""I got a serious police amber type scenarios with L's family. I'm f***ing stressing. I don't know if you are back but I need asylum somewhere because I think the cops might be headed my way.""
Newsweek has reached out to representatives for Depp and Manson for comment.
The newly-unsealed documents said that Depp's legal team sought to ensure the texts with Manson were not used in court because they argued it would ""smear Mr. Depp under a guilty by association theory.""
""Ms. Heard's attempt to inset Marilyn Manson into this case lacks foundation and is wholly speculative and constitutes improper character evidence,"" the filing read.
Following a televised trial in Virginia that concluded in late May, the jury ruled largely in Depp's favor on June 1, awarding him $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages while, Heard, who had countersued for $100 million for nuisance, was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages by the jury. The punitive damages against Heard were later reduced from $5 million to $350,000 under a Virginia law that caps such damages.
Meanwhile, Westwold star Wood first publicly named Manson as her alleged abuser in a post on Instagram on February 1, 2021, in which she claimed Manson had ""horrifically abused [her] for years"" and said she was ""brainwashed and manipulated"" by him.
On the same day that Wood named Manson publicly, four other women also came forward and accused the musician of sexual and physical violence, as well as mental, physical and emotional abuse.
At least 16 women have now come forward to make allegations against Manson, according to Rolling Stone.
Manson has vehemently denied all allegations made against him and has launched a defamation lawsuit against Wood over her Phoenix Rising documentary about her claims.
On March 3, Manson's legal team announced that a defamation lawsuit had been filed against Wood and ""her on-again, off-again romantic partner"" Ashley 'Illma' Gore in Los Angeles Superior Court.
""This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,"" Howard King, Manson's attorney, told Newsweek at the time. ""Years after the end of Evan Rachel Wood's long-term relationship with Warner, she and her girlfriend Illma Gore recruited numerous women and convinced them to make false allegations against him—claims that Wood and Gore scripted for them.""
The unsealed documents also show that Depp's team attempted to raise Heard's ""brief stint as an exotic dancer"" in court, as well as ""Amber Heard's sister Whitney's reality show video"" and ""Whitney and Amber's past romantic relationships.""",2022-08-01T11:43:49Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
"Unsealed Depp v. Heard court docs reveal crude texts with Marilyn Manson, 'exotic dancer' claims","Thousands of pages of documents filed in Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s bombshell defamation case were unsealed over the weekend, including text messages between the actor and Marilyn Manson and his team’s apparent attempt to bring up his ex-wife’s “brief stint as an exotic dancer” at trial.
The court documents, published online and verified by The Post, lay out of a series of behind-the-scenes moves by attorneys from both sides to get certain claims presented to the jury in Fairfax, Virginia.
One 965-page document filed March 28 details Heard’s opposition to a series of motions made by Depp’s lawyers, including one to exclude his medical history from the trial and others that asked to present potentially damaging information about the actress.
Lawyers for the “Aquaman” star said Depp sought to inappropriately bring up “Amber Heard’s sister Whitney’s reality show video” and “Whitney and Amber’s past romantic relationships,” the filing states.
Depp also wanted to tell the jury about “Amber’s brief stint as an exotic dancer years before she met Mr. Depp,” her lawyers wrote, as they also opposed, “Mr. Depp attempting to frivolously and maliciously suggest or imply that Ms. Heard was at one time an escort.”
The documents also showed new texts messages between Depp and rocker Manson, born Brian Warner, who has been accused of sexual abuse and grooming, including by his former fiancée Evan Rachel Wood, who he sued for defamation in March.

In a 2016 text, Manson allegedly wrote, “I got an amber 2.0” and also “Lindsay just puled an amber on me…please delete”
Depp responds, “I been reading A LOT of material on that and sociopathic behavior…it is fucking real my brother!! My ex-c—t is goddamn TEXTBOOK!!!” according to the document.
Then Manson, in an apparent reference to an incident where the police were called to Depp and Heard’s shared Los Angeles apartment in 2016, wrote, “I got a serious police amber type scenarios with L’s family. I’m fucking stressing. I don’t know if you are back but I need asylum somewhere because I think the cops might be headed my way,” the filing states.
Heard’s lawyers alleged that Depp and Manson went on “drug binges” together, including in the days before the actress arrived in Australia and the two got in a now-infamous fight that ended with the actor losing the tip of his right middle finger.

The filings also include a lengthy passage of allegations that Heard’s attorney Elaine Bredehoft claims she was unable to ask Depp’s former agent Tracey Jacobs about, including that the actor “lied to the LAPD.”
Included in the list of “relevant and damaging information” excluded at trial was “Mr. Depp appeared on TV drunk and stoned, to the point that Disney studio executives called Ms. Jacobs asking ‘What the hell was wrong with your client,'” the documents states. It is not clear what alleged appearance the attorney was referencing in the filing.
Heard’s team also claimed that “these same issues appeared during the filming of Pirates 5 and Disney told Ms. Jacobs the conduct was not ‘going to be tolerated,’ Disney was ‘not going to put up with this’ and that ‘there was no love between Johnny and Disney, given the Pirates five situation.’”
Depp’s relationship with Disney played a major role in the trial, as his lawyers argued that Heard’s defamatory allegations cost him tens of millions in future “Pirates” revenue, while Heard’s team argued Disney dropped the actor due to his own behavior.

Lawyers for the actor said that Heard’s team was offering misleading evidence, stating that Bredehoft “could have kept questioning Ms. Jacobs for a further three hours, but chose not to do so.”
Documents also show how Depp’s attorneys worked to exclude testimony regarding the actor’s arrest record and ongoing litigation for other cases, included a lawsuit accusing him of assault that was settled in July.
His lawyers, who were successful in their argument, said “it will serve no purpose other than to prejudice him in front of the jury” and that Heard would use to “proffer evidence that portrays Mr. Depp as a violent man.”

The jury awarded Depp $10.35 million over claims he was defamed by an op-ed article in which Heard made allegations of domestic abuse. She was awarded $2 million over her claims that Depp’s lawyer made false and damaging comments about her.
In an interview with NBC News following the jury’s verdict, Heard lamented evidence excluded from the trial, including “a binder worth of years of notes dating back to 2011 from the very beginning of my relationship that were taken by my doctor, who I was reporting the abuse to.”
“How could they make a judgment, how could they not come to that conclusion,” Heard said, referencing the evidence from which the jury was shielded.

Marilyn Manson: Er verdächtigt Evan Rachel Wood wegen Fake-FBI-Brief,"Laut ‚RadarOnline.com‘ behauptet der Schockrocker in seiner Klage, dass das Paar sogar einen gefälschten FBI-Brief geschrieben habe, in dem behauptet wurde, Evan sei eine Schlüsselzeugin in einer Untersuchung. Der Brief soll von einem echten Bundesagenten unterzeichnet worden und dann an Medienvertreter und andere mutmaßliche Opfer verteilt worden sein. Darin hieß es: „Wen es betreffen könnte, bitte beachten Sie, dass Frau Evan Rachel Wood eine Schlüsselzeugin im Zusammenhang mit einer strafrechtlichen Untersuchung in Los Angeles, Kalifornien, ist, an der eine internationale und bekannte Persönlichkeit des öffentlichen Lebens beteiligt ist. Die Sicherheit von Frau Wood, ihrer Familie, anderen Opfern und ihren Familien ist in dieser Zeit das größte Anliegen.“
Ein Brief, der von Mansons Anwalt Howard King an das Gericht geschrieben wurde, enthüllte, dass sein Büro Aufzeichnungen von Evans Scheidung von Jamie – von dem sie sich 2014 nach 19 Monaten Ehe trennte – vorliegen hat und behauptete, die 34-jährige Schauspielerin habe den angeblich gefälschten Brief verwendet, um ihren achtjährigen Sohn in Nashville bei sich zu behalten, weil sie argumentierte, dass der Junge in Gefahr wäre, wenn er mit seinem Vater nach Los Angeles ginge. In Gerichtsdokumenten hatte Bell gesagt, Evan habe ihm im Dezember 2020 einen Brief geschickt, der angeblich von Strafverfolgungsbeamten stammt, die mit den Ermittlungen in Verbindung stünden. Er fügte hinzu: „Der Brief wurde mir über die Messaging-App Signal geschickt.“ Jamie behauptete, Evan habe ihm zuerst einen Brief mit Illmas Namen oben geschickt, aber dann den Beitrag gelöscht. Er fuhr fort: „Der Brief war nicht auf irgendeinem Briefkopf der Abteilung und stammte angeblich von einer Frau namens Michelle Langer vom ‚Federal Violent Crimes Department‘. Ich habe gegoogelt, aber keine solche Abteilung oder Frau gefunden. Ich rief die Nummer für Michelle Langer auf dem Brief zwei Tage lang an. Diese Person gab mir eine andere Nummer, unter der ich anrief und eine Voicemail hinterließ. Ich habe nie etwas zurück gehört. Ich verstehe ehrlich gesagt nicht, was passiert. Entweder sind Evans Behauptungen, dass sie ‚Morddrohungen‘ erhält, wahr und Jack ist in ihrer Obhut nicht sicher, oder sie sind nicht wahr und sie enthält mir unseren Sohn aus anderen Gründen ihrer eigenen Erfindung vor.“

Evan Rachel Wood Seemingly Supports Amber Heard Following Trial Verdict,"Evan Rachel Wood has shown her support for Amber Heard following the latter's treatment on social media during her multi-million-dollar defamation trial against Johnny Depp.
Following the end of the trial, which saw a jury side with Depp, a number of social media accounts that saw an explosion in followers through sharing a barrage of anti-Heard content went on to target Wood amid her legal battle with Depp's friend Marilyn Manson.
The Westworld actress is herself embroiled in a legal dispute with an ex and has been sued by former fiancé Manson after publicly alleging that she was subjected to domestic abuse at the hands of the musician during their relationship.
Now Wood has taken to Instagram to show the social media response to Heard throughout (and after) her court battle with Depp.
Sharing an article from the outlet We Got This Covered titled ​​""Anti-Amber Heard online campaign is straight-up cyberbullying,"" Wood shared the findings from a report by Bot Sentinel, a nonpartisan group dedicated to uncovering and exposing online bots, and how they're used.
""What we observed was one of the worst cases of cyberbullying and cyberstalking by a group of Twitter accounts that we've ever seen,"" the report states, and noted that 627 accounts were created for the sole purpose to tweet on the defamation trial and about Heard and her supporters.
The report also noted that a similar scenario was taking place, with accounts being set up to target Wood.
""The abuse and targeted harassment continued well after the Depp vs. Heard trial ended, and unless Twitter takes action, the abuse and targeted harassment will still continue,"" the report states.
Newsweek has reached out to Wood for additional comment.
Wood shared a snippet from the article about the report without a caption and also shared some screenshots in her Stories.
With another celebrity legal battle set to likely dominate headlines, the social media landscape is already seeing a rise in opinion-based coverage on the case across various platforms.
Following a televised trial that concluded in late May, the jury on June 1 ruled largely in Depp's favor, awarding him $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages while, Heard, who had countersued for $100 million for nuisance, was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages by the jury.
Throughout the trial, Heard was the focus of endless scrutiny on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.
It would appear that Wood is now on the verge of receiving similar attention online, with Newsweek previously reporting on the explosion of targeted negativity towards Wood.
One YouTube video, posted on May 31 titled: ""An Amber Heard Sequel? The Hoax Against Marilyn Manson is Amber Heard Vs Johnny Depp On Steroids!"" has now clocked up more than 90,000 views.
Wood first publicly named Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, as her alleged abuser in a post on Instagram on February 1, 2021, in which she claimed Manson had ""horrifically abused [her] for years"" and said she was ""brainwashed and manipulated"" by him.

Imitador de Marilyn Manson denunciado por tocamientos indebidos,"Manuel Bravo Hurtado, imitador de Marilyn Manson de “Yo soy”, se presentó en el programa de Magaly Medina este 12 de julio para pronunciarse sobre la denuncia en su contra por tocamientos indebidos a su menor hija. El rockero desmintió dicha acusación y negó que haya dañado la integridad de su pequeña.
El presunto tocamiento indebido habría sucedido cuando la menor tenía 2 años. El caracterizador del interprete de ‘The Beautiful People’ mencionó que su expareja le impide ver a su niña desde hace cuatro años.
“Este denuncia me la hacen el 1 de julio, yo recién me entero. Me enteré de casualidad cuando fui a recoger una copia certificada (...) Cuando leí la denuncia, yo de verdad muy aparte del dolor me quedé decepcionado”, comentó
“Lo niego rotundamente, según refiere la recurrente, estos actos ocurrieron cuando el denunciado iba a visitar a su menor hija a casa de la deponente en el Cercado de Lima. Mi hija ha tenido una regresión astral a sus dos años y ha recordado que yo le hecho tocamientos indebidos y que mi hija informa que estos hechos se lo ha contado a una psicóloga particular, ¿por qué tanto odio? cuestionó Mike Bravo.

Marilyn Manson Felt He Inspired Guns N' Roses to Cover a Charles Manson Song,"Charles Manson had a number of connections to classic rock. For example, Guns N’ Roses covered Charles’ “Look at Your Game, Girl.” Subsequently, Guns N’ Roses’ Axl Rose and Marilyn Manson had differing memories of why Rose first heard the song.
Marilyn Manson | Niels Van Iperen / Contributor
Marilyn Manson didn’t like Guns N’ Roses’ Axl Rose
An album of Charles’ demos titled Lie: The Love and Terror Cult was released in 1970. The most famous track from the album is called “Look at Your Game, Girl.” During a 1993 interview with The New York Times, Rose said he was introduced to the song by his brother.
In his 1998 book The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, Marilyn said something different about the cover. “So what happened with Guns N’ Roses was that Trent [Reznor] took me to a U2 concert one night and backstage I met Axl Rose,” he recalled. “He was very neurotic and was telling me all about his psychological problems, his split personalities, and I felt like, ‘This guy’s a total f****** flake.’
“Being the overzealous type, I started telling him about my band anyway,” Marilyn continued. “And I said, ‘You know we do this song ‘My Monkey’ and it’s an adaptation of a Charles Manson song off his album Lie.’ And he’s like, ‘I never heard of that before.’ I told him, ‘You should check out the album, it’s cool.'”

Guns N’ Roses’ cover was so controversial it inspired backlash to a Marilyn Manson song
Marilyn said he inspired Guns N’ Roses to cover “Look at Your Game, Girl.” “And lo and behold six months later Guns N’ Roses put out The Spaghetti Incident and Axl Rose covers ‘Look at Your Game, Girl’ from the Lie album,” Marilyn said. “Then he started getting all that heat from Sharon Tate’s sister and everybody.”
Marilyn said the controversy surrounding Guns N’ Roses’ cover caused Nothing Records to try to get him to remove “My Monkey” from his album Portrait of an American Family. When he didn’t, the label wanted to drop his band. Ultimately, the album and the song were released in 1994.

How ‘Look at Your Game, Girl’ and ‘My Monkey’ performed on the charts in the United States
Guns N’ Roses’ “Look at Your Game, Girl” was not a single, so it did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The track appeared on the album “The Spaghetti Incident?” The album reached No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and remained on the chart for 22 weeks.
Meanwhile, Marilyn’s “My Money” did not become a single either. Portrait of American Family did not chart on the Billboard 200. Marilyn would not find chart success until a later phase of his career.
Guns N’ Roses’ “Look at Your Game, Girl” is an unusual chapter in the band’s history — regardless of who inspired Rose to cover the song.

Il 1 febbraio 2021 l’attrice e attivista Evan Rachel Wood ha rivelato con un post su Instagram di aver subito tra il 2006 e il 2010 violenze dall'allora suo fidanzato Brian Warner, in arte Marilyn Manson; ora la miniserie in due parti Phoenix Rising, prodotta e diretta da Amy Berg in onda su Sky Documentaries il 16 e il 24 giugno alle 21.15, (canali 122 e 402 di Sky), segue Wood nel racconto del lungo e difficile percorso che l’ha portata a denunciare le violenze subite nel corso della loro relazione, iniziata quando lei aveva diciotto anni e lui trentasette. Il documentario, prodotto da HBO, ricostruisce nella prima parte la carriera di Wood, attrice già da bambina e continuata con successo con ruoli da ragazzina precoce e problematica (Thirteen, Down in the Valley, Running With Scissors), e spiega come alcuni particolari del suo passato possono aver contribuito a portarla alla relazione con Manson. Nella seconda parte raccoglie prove e testimonianze a supporto del racconto di Wood, ma punta anche il dito contro i media che si sono accaniti contro la donna e ignorato il suo dolore, dando sostegno a Manson solo perché già famoso e affermato e racconta di come sia lui che suoi collaboratori le hanno mandato messaggi minacciosi. In uno lo stesso Manson scriveva ""Se parli, ti vengo a cercare"". Una riflessione, dunque, non solo sulla violenza domestica e sulle sue dinamiche, ma sulla scarsa tutela delle vittime e su come l'opinione pubblica sia fortemente influenzabile quando il presunto colpevole e la vittima sono personaggi pubblici. Quasi un decennio dopo essere sfuggita a una relazione pericolosa, l’attrice si è battuta con successo per l'approvazione della Phoenix Act, la legge che estende la prescrizione per i casi di violenza domestica in California, utilizzando coraggiosamente la propria esperienza e la propria visibilità per questa importante causa.

"Após Depp e Heard, Marilyn Manson e Evan Rachel Wood estrelam disputa judicial","SÃO PAULO, SP (FOLHAPRESS) – Nas considerações finais do advogado de Amber Heard, no julgamento em que saiu perdedora, com uma dívida de US$ 8,35 milhões a ser paga para seu ex-marido, Johnny Depp, que a processou por difamação, Benjamin Rottenborn descreveu para o júri o dilema por que passam muitas vítimas de violência doméstica. “Se você não fez fotos, não aconteceu; se fez, elas são falsas. Se não contou para os amigos, está mentindo; se contou, eles fazem parte do conluio.”
A atriz Evan Rachel Wood, de 34 anos, conhece bem esse dilema. Ela tinha 22 anos quando decidiu terminar um namoro de quatro anos, entre idas e vindas que incluíram um breve noivado, com o cantor Marilyn Manson.
Ele deu uma entrevista para a revista Spin depois do rompimento em que confirmou que a música “I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies”, quero te matar com fazem nos filmes, em tradução livre, era sobre as fantasias que tinha “todos os dias de esmagar a cabeça dela com uma marreta”.
Foi só em 2016, seis anos depois do fim do namoro, após ter virado ativista pelo direito das vítimas de violência doméstica, que Rachel Wood declarou publicamente que havia sido abusada sexualmente. Mas não revelou quem era o abusador, por medo de retaliação. Isso só aconteceu em fevereiro do ano passado, quando afirmou que havia sido manipulada, drogada e torturada repetidas vezes por Marilyn Manson, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Warner.
Entre uma coisa e outra, Rachel Wood se casou brevemente com o ator inglês Jamie Bell –o vilão da série “Iluminadas”, com Elizabeth Moss e Wagner Moura–, teve um filho, se mudou para um chalé nas montanhas e se descobriu bissexual.
Este ano, lançou um documentário em duas partes, “Renascendo das Cinzas”, que a HBO Max botou no ar há mais de um mês sem nenhuma promoção, porque o título não era uma prioridade do canal.
Em “Renascendo das Cinzas”, ela revê toda a história de sua vida, dos anos que viveu com Marilyn Manson, de como o namoro começou com uma amizade entre dois artistas e se transformou em uma relação doentia, até os dias de hoje, em que ainda não tem coragem de revelar onde mora, mas nos quais luta para “consertar essa sociedade, que instintivamente culpa as mulheres”.
O caso de Rachel Wood e Marilyn Manson é diferente do de Amber Heard e Johnny Depp. Marilyn Manson tem um histórico gigante de abusos. Em uma das cenas do documentário, Rachel Wood reúne outras seis vítimas do cantor, que contam histórias semelhantes à dela, de humilhação, tortura, lavagem cerebral, estupro, alienação dos amigos e da família.
Johnny Depp passou a vida adulta quase inteira namorando mulheres famosas que nunca o acusaram de nenhuma violência. Foi casado durante 14 anos com a atriz e cantora francesa Vanessa Paradis, e todo mundo viu no julgamento o testemunho da top model Kate Moss, que viveu com ele durante quatro anos e negou que ele tenha tido qualquer atitude agressiva com ela.
Mas as partes que coincidem são suficientes para incomodar. Primeiro, os dois homens são amigos há muitos anos. Marilyn Manson é padrinho do filho mais novo de Depp e Paradis, Jack Depp, que já tem 20 anos. Ele estava na primeira lista de possíveis testemunhas chamadas pelos advogados de Amber Heard, que descobriram, no celular de Depp, várias mensagens em que os dois combinavam transações de drogas.
E, em março, assim que o documentário foi lançado nos Estados Unidos, Marilyn Manson entrou com uma ação civil no Tribunal Superior de Los Angeles contra Evan Rachel Wood, alegando que as acusações da ex-namorada são uma grande mentira, e que por causa delas já perdeu contratos com gravadoras e trabalhos na TV e o cinema.

Marilyn Manson Unlikely To Be Charged In Sexual Assault Investigation: Report,"Marilyn Manson is reportedly unlikely to face charges of sexual assault, as law enforcement officials wrap up their ongoing investigation of the disgraced singer and prepare to present their case to the L.A. County District Attorney's Office. TMZ reports that, based on the lack of evidence, the D.A. is unlikely to proceed with charges.
Sources tell the outlet that there have been ""some credibility issues with the victim.""
While the D.A. may not move forward with the case now, if new evidence emerges, it can always be revisited.

The report comes after a lawsuit filed by a former personal assistant of Manson was dismissed by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Stern. The Judge ruled that the sexual assault, battery, and harassment accusations had passed the two-year statute of limitations in California.
“The plaintiff has pleaded too few facts and too late to keep this case in court,” he wrote in his ruling.
Evan Rachel Wood, who claims to be a survivor of abuse at the hands of Manson, released a documentary titled Phoenix Rising, earlier this year, which details the accusations.
In the documentary, Wood alleges that Manson ""essentially raped"" her while filming a sex scene for the music video to the song, “Heart-Shaped Glasses.""
“We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that,"" Woods says in the film. ""I’m a professional actress, I’ve been doing this my whole life, I had never been on a set that unprofessional in my life up until this day. It was complete chaos, I did not feel safe, no one was looking after me.""

Try refreshing your browser, or Judge dismisses abuse lawsuit filed against Marilyn Manson by former assistant Back to video Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael L. Stern dismissed the case made by Ashley Walters, who had sued the musician for alleged sexual assault, battery, and harassment, due to there being “too few facts too keep this case in court”. Stern also said it was brought “too late” to meet the statute of limitations rules. According to court documents, the judge dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning Walters will not be able to sue 53-year-old rocker Manson – whose real name is Brian Warner – over the same allegations in the future. Walters’ attorneys at Valli Kane Vagnini LLP and Hadsell Stormer Renick Dai LLP said in a statement to E! News: “We are deeply disappointed in the court’s decision today. “If allowed to stand, this decision would drastically limit the ability of victims of abuse to obtain justice through the legal system. We clearly pleaded the facts of this case in the complaint detailing the trauma and abuse Ashley endured, which prevented her from coming forward sooner.

In March, it was revealed Manson is suing his ex Evan Rachel Wood for defamation, fraud, and emotional distress over the “malicious falsehood” of abuse allegations against him. In February 2021, Evan claimed Manson “horrifically abused her for years”, while ‘Game of Thrones’ star Esme Bianco has accused him of sexual assault and sexual battery. Manson has denied the allegations, and he has described claims against him as “horrible distortions of reality”.

"Marilyn Manson Lawsuit Brought By Former Assistant Dismissed, Judge Rules Can’t Be Brought Again","Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael L. Stern said Wednesday that a former assistant to rocker Marilyn Manson had “too few facts too keep this case in court” and was brought too late to meet the statute of limitations rules. He dismissed the case “with prejudice,” meaning Manson can’t be sued again over the same allegations.
Ashley Walters, a former assistant to Manson between 2010 to 2011, sued him in May 2021. She alleged sexual harassment, abuse, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful termination, according to court documents.
The assistant claimed repressed memories delayed her filing the lawsuit. Walters’ attorney, Tanya Sukhija-Cohen, said that her client “couldn’t exercise her claims because she was unaware they occurred until the memories came back.”
Walters claimed her memories were jogged after attended a support group with other women who have alleged Manson abused them. Sukhija-Cohen likened Walters’ experience to that of Game of Thrones actor Esme Bianco, who has also alleged sexual abuse and filed a lawsuit against Manson.",2022-05-26T04:01:17Z,https://deadline.com,Deadline
Marilyn Manson Lawsuit From Former Assistant Dismissed For 2nd Time: Report,"A woman who once worked for Marilyn Manson sued the shock rocker, but this week, a California judge dismissed the case. Ashley Walters claimed that she worked as Manson's assistant until she was fired in 2011. Walters recently sued Manson, alleging that he ""engaged in threatening behavior,"" looked at her as if she was ""his property,"" and would offer her over to ""his influential industry friends and associates."" After she was let go, Walters alleged that the singer continued to harass her with accusations that she stole from his home and tried ruining his career.
Back in January, Walters's lawsuit was initially dismissed but a judge allowed her legal team to refile. However, she found a second dismissal today (May 25) because the judge claimed that the ""plaintiff has plead too few facts to keep this case in court.""

Additionally, The Insider reported that the judge also stated that this case was filed ""too late,"" as the statute of limitations had expired. This dismissal comes ""with prejudice,"" meaning that Walters cannot refile this case with the same allegations again.
Walters's attorneys at Valli Kane & Vagnini LLP and Hadsell Stormer Renick & Dai LLP released this statement to E! News:
""We are deeply disappointed in the court's decision today. If allowed to stand, this decision would drastically limit the ability of victims of abuse to obtain justice through the legal system. We clearly pleaded the facts of this case in the complaint detailing the trauma and abuse Ashley endured, which prevented her from coming forward sooner."" ""While the court based its decision on the timeliness of Ashley's claims and not the merits, we disagree with the court's interpretation of the law as it applies to equitable estoppel and the delayed filing of abuse claims. We remain confident that a full review of the facts in this case will result in a successful appeal, which we plan on filing.""
While this is a victory for Manson, it is a minor one; the singer is facing a slew of other allegations and lawsuits that are still awaiting a conclusion.

Marilyn Manson Former Assistant’s Sexual Assault Lawsuit Dismissed,"A lawsuit filed by a woman who worked as a personal assistant to Marilyn Manson has been dismissed, as Rolling Stone reports. According to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Stern, Ashley Walters’ accusations of sexual assault, battery, and harassment have surpassed the state of California’s two-year statute of limitations. “The plaintiff has pleaded too few facts and too late to keep this case in court,” he wrote in his ruling. Walters first sued the musician born Brian Warner for sexual assault, battery, and harassment in May of last year.
Walters worked as Manson’s assistant between 2010 and 2011. Walters claimed that during that time, Manson had promised creative opportunities but instead subjected her to verbal and psychological abuse, as well as multiple instances of sexual harassment. She told The Cut that Manson had hacked into her Facebook account after firing her in a paranoid fit.
Manson has faced multiple accusations of sexual assault, abuse, and battery since Evan Rachel Wood publicly named him as her abuser for the first time in February 2021. After Wood came forward, several other women began taking legal action for similar allegations against Manson, including actor Esmé Bianco, model Ashley Morgan Smithline, and an anonymous “Jane Doe” who claimed she’d dated Manson in 2011. In September, a judge dismissed Jane Doe’s suit, ruling that her allegations were “not sufficient to invoke the delayed discovery rule.” She refiled within days, and her suit remains open.
As the abuse allegations continued to pile up, the label Loma Vista dropped Manson from its roster, and Manson was cut out from scenes he’d shot for the TV shows American Gods and Creepshow. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department announced that it was opening an investigation into the accusations against Manson in mid-February, and the department carried out a search of Manson’s home in November.
Amid the investigation in Los Angeles, Manson surrendered himself to authorities in New Hampshire over a 2019 warrant. He pleaded not guilty to the two misdemeanor charges of assault against a photographer in September. Manson has repeatedly denied all other allegations of abuse and assault against him.
In January, Evan Rachel Wood announced Phoenix Rising, a two-part documentary focused on her allegations of Manson’s abuse and its aftermath. She produced the project in secret with director Amy Berg, revealing details of Manson’s alleged torture and manipulation. Wood also claimed that Manson had sexually assaulted her on camera while shooting a music video. Manson is now suing her for defamation, but Wood addressed her feelings in a March interview with The View: “I’m not scared.”

Marilyn Manson Ex-Assistant’s Abuse Lawsuit Dismissed,"A Los Angeles Superior Court judge dismissed a lawsuit against Marilyn Manson on Wednesday (May 25) filed by his former personal assistant. The documents, received by Billboard, cite the statute of limitations as the reason for dismissal, as the incidents occurred in 2010 and 2011.

The judge dismissed the case with prejudice, prohibiting plaintiff Ashley Walters from refiling the charges.
Walters originally filed her lawsuit against Manson (real name Brian Warner) in May 2021, alleging sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress, among other claims. She also named his label, Marilyn Manson Records Inc., as a co-defendant. Manson has since denied all claims of sexual abuse.
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
In March, Walters filed an amended lawsuit explaining that she repressed memories of Manson’s alleged abuse until recently and that she felt threatened by Manson’s lawyers for appearing in his ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood’s recently released Phoenix Rising documentary, according to Rolling Stone.
Walters was an aspiring photographer in 2010 when she first met Manson, who had complimented her work on social media, according to the suit. According to published reports, Walters was hired as Manson’s PA in August 2010 and claims she was subjected to a toxic working environment, in which she faced aggression, violence, threats and more before her departure the following year, which she details in the suit. Walters also claimed Manson made her work for 48 hours straight, and he invited his friends to sexually assault her.
Walters’ accusations came amid a string of more than a dozen accusers who came forward after Wood accused her former fiancé of grooming and sexual abuse on Twitter in February 2021. Marilyn Manson is still facing lawsuits from three women: Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco, model Ashley Morgan Smithine and a Jane Doe.

A Los Angeles judge dismissed former Marilyn Manson assistant Ashley Walters' amended abuse and wrongful termination lawsuit on Wednesday, citing ""too few facts,"" and claims beyond the statute of limitations.
Walters, who was Manson's assistant between 2010 to 2011, initially sued the artist over alleged sexual harassment, abuse, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful termination in May 2021, according to court documents.
On Wednesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael L. Stern said that ""plaintiff has plead too few facts too keep this case in court, and too late,"" and dismissed the case with prejudice, which means Walters cannot sue Manson over the same allegations in the future.
Walters' attorney Tanya Sukhija-Cohen claimed in court that her client ""couldn't exercise her claims because she was unaware they occurred until the memories came back,"" during a support group meeting with other women who have alleged Manson abused them. Sukhija-Cohen added that the alleged threats that Walters experienced were not ""materially different,"" than ones ""Game of Thrones"" actor Esme Bianco has alleged in her sexual abuse lawsuit against Manson.
Manson's attorney Gene Williams, said that the amended suit relied on ""a contradiction they can't get out of, where the same incidents she didn't recall dissuaded her from filing.""
In her lawsuits, Walters accused Manson of forcing her to work for two days straight, during which she says she feared Manson's frequent violent and angry outbursts. Walters had filed an amended lawsuit on March 11 after Stern called into question the timeline of her allegations in relation to the existing two-year statute of limitations.
Walters accused Manson of pushing her onto his ""influential industry friends and associates,"" including an actor who forcefully kissed her in September 2010. She also claimed that Manson harassed her by forcefully kissing her.
Manson's team denied all of the allegations in both of Walters' lawsuits and asked a judge in April to dismiss her claims without an opportunity to file another amended complaint.

Johnny Depp had a ""jealous streak"" with former girlfriends and was jealous of fellow actors like Nicolas Cage, a former long-time friend claimed to court on Thursday.
Bruce Witkin, the actor's former bandmate and friend of many years, testified that Mr Depp, 58, would often become jealous of male colleagues of former wife Amber Heard, 36.
Testifying via video deposition, the witness claimed his former friend of over 40 years- who he hasn't seen since 2018 - had ""deep rooted issues"" that ""had nothing to do with Amber"".
Mr Witkin also claimed that Mr Depp and musician Marilyn Manson would often consume alcohol and drugs together - claiming the two friends ""would hit it pretty hard"".

Mr Depp is suing his former wife for alleged defamation over an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in 2018, in which she stated she was a victim of domestic abuse.
The Aquaman actress is countersuing her ex-husband for $100million (£81million).
At the start of his testimony heard in Virginia's Fairfax County Courthouse on Thursday, Mr Witkin began by stating his former bandmate Mr Depp ""definitely"" had a ""jealous streak"" in relationships prior to Ms Heard, and listed the Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage as someone Mr Depp had been jealous of previously.

Mr Witkin went on to add that the Pirates of the Caribbean actor would ""work himself up"" when his then-wife Ms Heard would work with male co-stars.
He recalled Mr Depp drinking and smoking weed with shock-rocker Marilyn Manson, 53, and claimed his former friend ""tried to clean up a couple of times"" when discussing his alleged drug and alcohol abuse.
Mr Witkin explained how he was surprised by Mr Depp's alleged cocaine use, claiming the actor ""hated"" the substance when younger and that the actor hid his use from him for a ""long time, until I believe 2016.""

Discussing Mr Depp going to therapy, Mr Witkin said: ""He did it a little bit, and then he stopped. My experience, it’s deep rooted issues that he’s dealing with that had nothing to do with Amber, that’s my opinion.""
He went on to state he never witnessed Mr Depp or Ms Heard physically abuse each other and said he hadn't seen the actor since 2018.
""Can’t get through to him, no return texts, no email,"" Ms Witkin said in his video deposition.

He went on to add: ""I think there was lies and bull**** said about me that he actually believed, which is surprising.
""I know he wasn’t happy about my testimony but I wasn’t going to lie.""
Ms Heard and Mr Depp struck up a romance in 2011, after meeting on the set of the set of the comedy-drama film, The Rum Diary. They tied the knot in February 2015.

Johnny Depp’s admirers ‘disturbingly’ backing Marilyn Manson amid Depp-Heard trial,"Johnny Depp’s admirers ‘disturbingly’ backing Marilyn Manson amid Depp-Heard’s trial
Johnny Depp’s friend Marilyn Manson have been receiving support of the actor’s die-hard fans, who alleged that Manson, just like Depp, could be a victim of “false accusations” by his ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood.
The Post reported that since the court proceedings for Depp-Amber Heard’s defamation trial has been on a hiatus until May 16, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor’s super-fans has recently turned to Twitter and initiated hashtag #IStandWithMarilynManson last week, the same way they did for Depp – #JusticeforJohnnyDepp – smear campaign against Heard on social media.
It is pertinent to mention that in February 2021, Wood turned to Instagram and shared a post in which she blamed the singer-songwriter for “horrific abuse”.
The Barefoot actress wrote, ““I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.”
Interestingly, one of Depp’s admirer shared a photo of both Heard and Wood on Twitter and wrote, “In the world of showbiz there’s always two toxic friends who decide to put Regina George to shame and that’s Amber Heard and Evan Rachel Wood.”
Another chimed in, “I see so many similarities between Amber Heard and Evan Rachel Wood. The fake abuse. The ‘I am an innocent girl, he tried to lure me to his house by promising movie’ talk.”
Other user said, “I’ve always believed both Depp and Manson are innocent. AH and ERW just saw an opportunity with the #MeToo movement to gain clout. But they are just destroying women’s credibility with domestic violence and sexual assault.”

Why Some 'Have Issues' With Johnny Depp and Marilyn Manson's Friendship,"Johnny Depp has been a major movie star for more than three decades. While Depp has always been a firm fan favorite, the past several years have seen the star caught up in a whirl of controversy amidst his divorce from Amber Heard and the subsequent court case.
Recently, Depp took the stand in the defamation trial involving Heard. In it, he opened up about his relationship with shock rocker Marilyn Manson. That friendship with Manson is causing a lot of conjecture online. A few critics have even claimed that Depp’s association with Manson has caused them to have some “issues” with their perception of the actor.

Depp’s friendship with Manson dates back to the ’90s when Depp was a young star on the rise. Manson, an established musician known for his outrageous stage performances and over-the-top black and white makeup, was frequently in the headlines — and he and Depp quickly bonded. During the early years of their friendship, the two stars gave each other various gifts, including a house that Depp bought for Manson.
When Depp started a family, he asked Manson to be the godfather of his daughter, Lily-Rose Depp. The stars even have matching tattoos, which Manson described to Rolling Stone as art featuring “Charles Baudelaire, the flowers of evil, this giant skeleton thing” on their backs and the phrase “no reason” on their wrists.
What ‘issues’ are people having with Johnny Depp’s friendship with Marilyn Manson?

Manson has had his own legal troubles. He’s been the subject of allegations of abuse coming from his ex-girlfriend, Evan Rachel Wood. With Depp’s history in the headlines, a few public figures are speaking out about the friendship between Depp and Manson. “If Johnny Depp is friends with Marilyn Manson I have issues,” podcast host and reality TV expert Kate Casey wrote on Twitter. Some fans replied to her tweet, alleging that Depp and Manson aren’t as close these days due to the scandal involving Wood and Manson.
Casey went on to write, “I wonder if he remained friends after it was clear how he operates. After watching Evan’s HBO documentary you have to wonder how anyone could have remained friends with someone with so many strange behaviors.” The comments on Casey’s tweet were mixed. Some defended Depp, while others claimed that Manson might be a victim of media spin.
Depp opened up about Manson while on the stand
In the ongoing defamation trial between Heard and Depp, lawyers have asked Depp about his friendship with Manson multiple times. During Depp’s recent testimony, one of Heard’s lawyers, Ben Rottenborn, asked Depp about this. “One of your good friends that you’ve taken drugs with before is Marilyn Manson, right?”
Depp told Rottenborn (via NME), “Yes, we’ve drunk together, (and) we have had cocaine together maybe a couple of times.” Rottenborn pressed Depp to explain whether he had taken pills with Manson. Depp paused before responding, “Um, I once gave Marilyn Manson a pill so that he would stop talking so much.” His response made the courtroom erupt with laughter. It’s very possible that in the coming weeks, fans could learn even more about Depp’s relationship with Manson, including whether the two are still good friends.

A year after she sued Marilyn Manson for sexual assault and human trafficking, actress Esmé Bianco told a federal judge that the singer recently “used his power and influence” to get her cut from a tour video with the Deftones.
In a filing Wednesday in Los Angeles federal court, Bianco said she wanted to expand her lawsuit to include an allegation of “tortious interference” by Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner. She says she had already completed the shoot, but that Warner succeeded in getting her images cut from the video, depriving her of “significant public exposure.”

“Warner proceeded to contact the band and confront them over the Deftones’ decision to work with Ms. Bianco,” she wrote. “Defendant Warner used his power and influence in the entertainment industry to interfere with Ms. Bianco’s ability to continue working with the Deftones.”
Bianco, best known for her work in Game of Thrones and an ex-girlfriend of Warner’s, is one of several woman who have accused him of wrongdoing over the past year. Ashley Walters, a former assistant, sued him in May, and model Ashley Morgan Smithline filed her own case in June.
The actress Evan Rachel Wood, another ex-girlfriend, has not filed a lawsuit but has leveled similar accusations in public statements, including in a high-profile documentary called Phoenix Rising, prompting Warner to sue her for defamation.
Manson has strongly denied all allegations. In his lawsuit against Wood, he says the multiple accusations are the result of a scheme orchestrated by the actress to destroy his career. He says she and another woman “secretly recruited, coordinated and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse.” Wood has denied those allegations.
Bianco sued in April 2021, claiming Warner had, among other shocking allegations, “used drugs, force and threats of force to coerce sexual acts” and had “locked Ms. Bianco in the bedroom, tied her to a prayer kneeler and beat her with a whip that Mr. Warner said was utilized by the Nazis.” He has since moved to dismiss the case, arguing that his accusers are “cynically and dishonestly seeking to monetize and exploit the #MeToo movement.”

"Getting Cross-Examined By Amber Heard’s Team, Johnny Depp Admits To Doing Drugs With Marilyn Manson And More","Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been in the midst of a legal battle for years, but things have really stepped up over the last week. The U.S. trial has offically begun, with Depp himself testifying for days on end about his experience with the Aquaman actress. And while getting cross-examined by Heard’s team, Depp admitted to doing drugs with Marilyn Manson and more.
Actor Johnny Depp has taken the stand for days, resulting in countless headlines regarding his family history, struggles with substance abuse , and recounting his allegations of abuse against Amber Heard. His ex-wife’s legal team got the chance to cross examine the Pirates of the Caribbean star, with People reporting that he admitted drug use with some celebrities. That includes controversial recording artist Marilyn Manson, as Depp offered on the stand:
We've had cocaine together maybe a couple of times. I once gave Marilyn Manson a pill so that he would stop talking so much.
While the situation with Johnny Depp and Amber Heard is a serious one, he’s been cracking a few jokes from the stand. That’s seemingly the case when it came to Marilyn Manson, as he called the singer chatty in the mist of admitting their drug use together. Manson’s involvement is sure to turn a few heads, especially since the singer’s ex Evan Rachel Wood has alleged sexual and physical abuse by him. Of course, Manson wasn’t the only notable name that was dropped in the examination of Depp.
A variety of celebrities have been tied to Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s legal issues, including Elon Musk (who famously challenged Depp to a cage fight ) and Aquaman star Jason Momoa. MCU favorite Paul Bettany has also been named in the drama, with Deep being asked on the stand if the WandaVision actor was a “good friend you've done drugs with.” The Edward Scissorhands star seemed to take umbrage with the question, but confirmed his friendship with Bettany by saying:
That's a strange question. Paul Bettany is a good friend, yes.
Paul Bettany got involved in the Johnny Depp drama because of a text conversations the pair had about his issues with Amber Heard. The texts date back to 2013, and include the two joking about killing Heard. Depp reportedly sent this message to his Mortdecai co-star:
Let's drown her before we burn her!!! I will fuck her her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she is dead.
Paul Bettany’s reps have failed to provide a comment to the story by People, but it should be interesting to see how much the MCU fan favorite ends up involved in the legal proceedings between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.
The drama between the two stars should continue for the foreseeable future, with Amber Heard also set to testify in court. Depp revealed bombshells from the stand, and smart money says that his ex will do just the same. Given the millions of dollars and professional stakes of the trial, tensions are definitely high.",2022-04-22T13:27:58Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Johnny Depp contre Amber Heard : l'acteur sommé de s'expliquer sur un message ultra-violent envoyé à ses amis,"Johnny Depp a été interrogé sur des SMS très violents échangés avec l'acteur Paul Bettany, ou encore avec chanteurs Patti Smith et Marilyn Manson dans lesquels il décrit ce qu'il aimerait faire endurer à Amber Heard.
Ce jeudi 21 avril, Amber Heard a pu donner sa version des faits. Enfin, la jeune femme a pu s'expliquer face aux accusations de diffamation portées par Johnny Depp à son encontre.

Durant ce procès, Johnny Depp a été interrogé par la Cour au sujet de SMS étranges envoyés à l'acteur Paul Bettany, aux chanteurs Patti Smith et Marilyn Manson mais aussi à son chef de la sécurité Stephen Deuters. L'acteur se décrit alors comme un ""monstre"" lorsqu'il est sous l'influence de la drogue et de l'alcool. Pire encore, le tribunal a entendu des échanges horribles entre le comédien et son chef de la sécurité. Il lui expliquait alors vouloir faire du mal à Amber Heard : ""Noyons-la avant de la brûler""
Johnny Depp : ""Elle n'aimait pas ça quand elle avait l'impression que j'étais sous l'effet de la drogue et de l'alcool""
Des échanges tragiques comme toute cette histoire. De son côté, la jeune femme a reconnu avoir frappé Johnny Depp. Néanmoins, les avocats de l'actrice ont tenu à faire remarquer à la Cour que leur cliente était une personne inquiète lorsque son conjoint était sous l'effet de la drogue et de l'alcool : ""Elle n'aimait pas ça quand elle avait l'impression que j'étais sous l'effet de la drogue et de l'alcool"", a d'ailleurs reconnu Johnny Depp lors de son témoignage de jeudi.

Johnny Depp Keeps Making Jokes During Testimony,"Johnny Depp. Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo/POOL/AFP via Getty Images
On April 21, Amber Heard’s lawyers pushed back against Johnny Depp’s claims in court — confronting him with violent text messages and evidence of drug and alcohol abuse. His demeanor seemed to shift. Sometimes, Depp had a humorous air; at other times, he seemed somewhere between deadpan and defensive — like when he was asked if he had severed his own finger and used it to deface a painting by drawing a penis.
The Pirates of the Caribbean actor’s testimony stems from a years-long history of intense legal mudslinging. Heard had accused Depp of abuse in 2016, and she wrote generally of abuse in a Washington Post op-ed in 2018. Heard did not mention Depp’s name, but he sued her in May 2019, claiming he was the clear target of her piece and that her implications had ruined his career.
Heard’s lawyer Ben Rottenborn’s cross-examination came to include mentions of other high-profile pals, such as Elton John and Marilyn Manson, and several awkward moments of laughter in court. Many of the text messages in question — including those exchanged with Paul Bettany, in which Depp suggested he wanted to “burn” Heard — have been made public, but these missives were new to jurors. This was both a defensive and offensive strategy: Heard’s lawyers wanted to undermine Depp’s credibility and paint him as an out-of-control abuser. If they succeed, that foundation bolsters her counterclaim that Depp lied in denying domestic abuse, which, Heard claims, defamed her. (It sounds like a circular mess because it is.)
Things got stranger when Rottenborn asked about drug use. While Depp looked stern at times, he responded to some of the questions with wry one-liners. “One of your good friends that you’ve taken drugs with before is Marilyn Manson, right?” Rottenborn asked. (Manson has also been accused of abuse.) “Yes. We’ve drank together. We’ve had cocaine together maybe a couple of times,” Depp responded plainly. “I once gave Marilyn Manson a pill so that he would stop talking so much. Sorry,” Depp said, spurring chuckles in the courtroom.
When Rottenborn asked Depp about a photo from March 2013 showing whiskey and, potentially, cocaine, Depp said that he had “fallen off the wagon” when he was filming The Lone Ranger and that it was normal for there to be a glass of liquor on the table when he returned home. “You would sometimes drink whiskey in the mornings, too, right? During this time?” Rottenborn asked. “I mean, isn’t happy hour anytime?” Depp said, setting off light laughter in the room.
At one point, Heard’s attorneys played a video in which Depp appeared to be acting erratically. (Observers could hear smashing noises in the background but not see what was causing them in the video.) “I did assault a couple of cabinets, but I did not assault Ms. Heard,” Depp said.

Courtroom erupted in laughter as Johnny Depp joked about doing drugs with Marilyn Manson
During a slander case against Amber Heard, Johnny Depp reportedly delivered a joke about using drugs with Marilyn Manson, causing the courtroom to erupt in laughter.
When challenged about his drug use, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor was cross-examined by Heard’s attorneys.
Depp’s lawyer, Ben Rottenborn, questioned whether he ever gave Marilyn Manson a drug to make him stop talking so much, and Depp answered that he “once gave Marilyn Manson a pill to make him stop talking so much.”
“Would you ever drink whiskey first thing in the morning?”
Depp said playfully, “I mean, every hour is happy hour.”
Rottenborn was the one who inquired.
Meanwhile, Depp has denied ever physically or sexually abusing Heard, claiming that it was Heard who assaulted him violently.
Depp also claimed that a 2018 op-ed piece she penned in The Washington Post referring to herself as a “public figure symbolising domestic abuse” had harmed his career.
According to Depp, the piece unfairly tarnished his Hollywood reputation, costing him the role of Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean.",2022-04-21T16:10:02Z,https://www.bolnews.com,BOL News
Heavy metal and bluegrass guitarist John 5 on his musical obsessions,"He's become one of the most acclaimed guitarists today of heavy metal — and bluegrass. John Lowery, performing under the stage name John 5, has played with Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie and David Lee Roth, and recorded with Lynyrd Skynyrd. But he traces his appreciation for the guitar to watching ""Hee Haw"" as a kid.
The musicianship he saw performing country tunes inspired him to pursue a virtuosity that is as much at home in a heavy metal club as it is at a hootenanny. During concerts with his group, John 5 and the Creatures, he will riff tunes ranging from rock to country, which only seems weird when you factor in his stage makeup.
John 5, one of the most acclaimed guitarists today who's played with Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie and David Lee Roth, found inspiration as a child by watching ""Hee Haw."" CBS News
""I love Roy Clark,"" he told CBS News' Jake Barlow. ""I started playing guitar at the age of seven. My parents would always watch 'Hee Haw.' Everything comes to when you're a young child, your brain develops in what you want to do, what you like, what you don't like. And I remember seeing this young boy, he was probably a little older than me, but he was an incredible banjo player. I was like, 'Whoa, this is incredible!'"" [The boy, Jimmy Henley, won a bluegrass banjo world championship at age 10, and would go on to appear as a regular cast member of ""Hee Haw"" for more than 25 years.]
""And I knew I wanted to play electric guitar, so I thought, well, instead of banjo I'll play electric guitar. I was so obsessed with playing guitar. I don't know what I would be doing other than guitar because I've been playing guitar for so long. The only other thing I like to do is clean a house. I know that sounds odd, but I feel very organized, so, maybe I would be a male maid if I wasn't a guitar player.""
To watch an interview with John 5 click on the video player below:
He described a rather sheltered life growing up, and moving to California to give it the old ""high school try."" High school try? ""'Cause I didn't go to college,"" he said.
""I went to L.A. and I was, like, looking around and figured everything out and met a couple of people, and first night I was there I got all my money and everything stolen. But I never give up with anything. So, I was like, OK, we move on.
""I just was meeting people, and I said, 'I play guitar,' and they're like, 'Oh, we're doing a session for this.' I said, 'Oh, well, I'll charge this' — because I knew what people were getting, what people were charging for these sessions, and I thought for myself, I will do it for half the price and half the time. Because they want to get you in and out. So, I got this little reputation of, here's this kid who will do it for half the price and it only takes him half an hour to do his stuff.
""I just wanted to be a session musician because I hated to travel. I was doing Rick Springfield and Wilson Phillips and TV shows like 'Baywatch,' 'Jay Leno Show,' 'Mortal Combat' movie. I did all these things, every day it was something else. And I got a lot of work, 'cause it doesn't matter what you do in life, you always want to save a dollar, so I was doing it for cheaper than everyone else. And I knew people would go for that. I tried to do the best for them, and it really worked.""

A fan of Marilyn Manson, Lowery played with David Lee Roth, and had just returned from a European tour with Rob Halford in 1998 when he received a call from Manson's manager, Tony Ciulla, who said they were having problems with their guitar player and asked if he could meet with Manson. ""And I said, sure!
""We went to Gaucho Grill on Ventura, and I remember pulling up there, and I've never seen Manson, I've never met him or anything, never saw him in concert, but I remember looking in his car — I was like, this must be his car — there's a David Lee Roth CD and a Rob Halford CD on the back seat. That's quite a coincidence!
""So, I go upstairs, and he's wearing big red sunglasses and Loverboy T-shirt: 'I want you to be in the band. Your name is going to be John 5 — I want to do everything with numbers.'
""And I was like, 'OK. Yeah, I love your music, and I would love to be a part of it.'
""And he goes, 'You just have to shave your eyebrows off and you're in.'
""And I was like, 'OK. … Here? ' 'No, no, no, later!'""
In fact, the first time John saw Manson live was the first time he played with him, at the 1998 Video Music Awards. He would perform with Manson's band for six years, before moving off on his own.
Guitar Player
""After I left Marilyn Manson, I didn't really know what to do, so I was like, well, maybe I'll make an instrumental record. And I wanted to make if for my friends at Christmas time and give it to them as a gift. I thought that'll be a fun gift. And this small record company said, 'We want to release this.' I thought. 'Oh that's odd, you know? But OK, cool!' And they put it out. And it was so, it's just amazing, but it had such a great response. They put me on the cover of Guitar Player and all this stuff, because it was different. I played this heavy metal music and country, all these crazy styles. And people just loved it.
""And I didn't do it for anything but just to give it to my friends. And I love playing guitar and appreciate music and, it was just done from the heart.
""But I never wanted to tour. Every interviewer asked me, 'Are you gonna go on tour? ' I said, 'No,' because really in the back of my mind I thought, Nobody will want to see this. Nobody wants to see this stuff! I really thought that. I'm being honest. My wife was like, 'You should go out and play shows.' Really? And it was just so successful, and I thank the crowd every night, and I was shocked but people really enjoy it, maybe because I enjoy it so much, I love it.""
In addition to his recordings with Zombie, Roth, 2wo, Paul Stanley, Sebastian Bach and others, John 5 has recorded 13 albums solo and with his band, the Creatures. His repertoire ranges from hard tracks, like ""Midnight Mass"" (from the album ""Invasion""):
… to the very un-metal track ""Howdy"":
… and the bluesy-urban track ""I Like the Funk"":
His latest album, ""Sinner,"" mixes heavy metal with jazz standards, including ""How High the Moon"" and ""Georgia On My Mind"":
""I always look for inspiration, and I've gone through epiphanies, always, starting with 'Hee Haw' [and] Roy Clark,"" he said. ""And seeing Jimi Hendrix when they were playing the movie 'Woodstock' on cable, I got obsessed with Jimi Hendrix. And then I got into Kiss, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is the greatest.' And then I was so obsessed with Kiss, I got the first Van Halen record 'cause on the back it said 'Gene Simmons.' I was getting anything I could Kiss. And then going from Kiss to Van Halen, then Yngwie Malmsteen, then Chet Atkins, the list goes on and on. But I'm always, always looking for inspiration.
""I think nowadays Instagram is such a wonderful tool for that. Because if you look up, like, a guitar player in your feed, you'll see other guitar players. Just like if you look up cooking you will get in your feed a bunch of cooking stuff. So, I use that as a tool, not just promoting yourself or having your own TV channel if you will, but for education, to see other guitar players, learn things. It's a wonderful tool.""
John 5 and the Creatures are currently embarking on a North American tour.
""I never dreamt about any of this. I didn't even think anyone would ever want to talk to me, I just wanted to be a session musician. So, I never dreamt or hoped for any of this at all. I just wanted to play guitar. I love guitar and music so much, that's all I wanted to do. Now doing what I do, it doesn't matter how cold, or how rainy, or anything like that — anywhere I am, if I have a guitar in my hand, playing for people, I just appreciate it so much.
""I practice all the time. If I wouldn't be talking to you I would be playing right now,"" he said. ""It's a terrible, terrible thing, because it's really kind of taken over my life so much. Sometimes I'll be playing and I'll start in the morning, and I'll be like, it's dark; I better eat and go to the bathroom. That will happen when no one is around. Like, if I'm on tour and no one is with me and I have the day off, I just lose track of time. It's a crazy obsession, but it's a good obsession, at least I'm not doing anything to hurt anybody or hurt myself or anything like that. So I'm OK with it and hopefully making a couple of people smile along the way.
""I just love going out playing for people. And I love meeting the people and hearing their stories. It really is a dream. I really think the meaning of life is just doing what you love. It's been wonderful.""
John 5 and the Creatures are now on their ""Sinner"" tour, which continues this week with dates in California (Roseville, Garden Grove and San Diego) and in Las Vegas. The tour runs through July 17 in the U.S. and Canada, and then continues in Australia in December.

Johnny Depp Testifies He Gave Marilyn Manson Pill so He'd Shut up,"Johnny Depp was questioned about using drugs with Marilyn Manson in his trial against ex-wife Amber Heard.
""I once gave Marilyn Manson a pill so he would stop talking so much,"" Depp testified.

Johnny Depp briefly talked about his friendship with Marilyn Manson in testimony for his trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard on Thursday.
Asked by one of Heard's lawyers whether they used drugs together, Depp answered that they did.
""We drank together, we've had cocaine together, maybe a couple of times,"" Depp answered.
When asked whether they took ""pills"" together, Depp's answer led to laughter in the courtroom.
""I once gave Marilyn Manson a pill so he would stop talking so much,"" he said.
The trial, held in Fairfax, Virginia, is over a lawsuit Depp brought against Heard in March 2019. He alleged she defamed him by describing herself as a victim of domestic violence. She denied the allegations and claims Depp often physically abused her while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Much of the first week of the trial was comprised of testimony from friends, family, and employees of Depp, who said they never witnessed Depp act violently toward Heard or abuse drugs. Depp had employed a doctor and nurse to help with addiction, but it was only to treat him for an opioid addiction he developed after taking a painkiller following a leg injury, the medical professionals testified.
In cross-examination Thursday, the third day of Depp personally giving testimony on the stand, Heard's lawyers sought to paint a different picture. They brought up text messages where Depp suggested he used copious amounts of drugs or alcohol, which the actor said were either exaggerations or misleading without more context.
Depp testified earlier in the trial that he began using drugs at the age of 11, using his mother's ""nerve pills"" before moving on to marijuana. But throughout his life, he used them only to ""numb"" rather than ""party,"" and kept his usage under ""control,"" he said.
Heard's lawyers asked him whether he used drugs with celebrity friends like ""Wandavision"" actor Paul Bettany or Manson — the latter of whom is the subject of at least 16 public misconduct allegations. Depp answered affirmatively, but denied that drug use was ever excessive.",2022-04-21T04:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER

Marilyn Manson Asks Judge to Dismiss Walters' Amended Abuse Lawsuit,"Marilyn Manson's attorneys have asked a Los Angeles judge to dismiss his former assistant's new lawsuit.
Former assistant Ashley Walters filed an amended sexual abuse and wrongful termination lawsuit in March.
Manson's attorneys and an LA judge previously called into question the timeline of Walters' allegations.

Attorneys representing shock rocker Marilyn Manson have asked a Los Angeles judge to dismiss former assistant Ashley Walters' amended abuse and wrongful termination lawsuit, according to court documents filed on Tuesday.
In the filing, Manson's attorneys maintained that Walters' claims were past California's statute of limitations. His attorneys added that Walters' claim that she only understood the legal weight of the allegations after conferring with other accusers in 2020 also did not apply, nor did the usage of a ""delayed discovery"" argument.
""Plaintiff's SAC (second amended complaint) fails because each of her causes of action are outside the applicable statute of limitations by nearly a decade,"" Manson's attorneys wrote. ""Plaintiff has had three opportunities to plead her case, but it is obvious that neither the delayed discovery rule, equitable estoppel, nor her creative writing skills cannot revive her expired claims.""
Walters submitted a new complaint following a request from Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael L. Stern for her team to file an amended complaint by March 11 after calling into question the timeline of her allegations in relation to the two-year statute of limitations.
""However, Plaintiff's reliance on the delayed discovery rule, which was created to protect young children who were too young and naïve to understand the nature of the abuse they had suffered, is borderline offensive, as well as misplaced and insufficient given the facts alleged by Plaintiff in her various complaints,"" Manson's attorneys wrote.
In her amended suit, Walters claimed she was threatened with legal action if she were to participate in interviews around her allegations, including in actress Evan Rachel Wood's documentary ""Phoenix Rising,"" which is centered around Wood's allegations of sexual assault against Manson.
""On January 7, 2022, Defendants sent Plaintiff an email through her counsel, threatening to take retaliatory legal action against her if she 'participate[ed] in any interviews about Mr. Warner or reveal[ed] any confidential information' about him,"" Walters' attorneys wrote in the amended March complaint, referring to Manson by his birth name Brian Warner, mentioning that Wood was sued for sharing her allegations in her documentary.
On March 2, ahead of the release of Wood's documentary, Manson sued Wood for defamation, calling her allegations ""a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV, and film career.""
Walters, who was Manson's assistant between 2010 to 2011, initially sued the artist over alleged sexual harassment, abuse, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful termination in May 2021, according to court documents.
In her lawsuits, Walters accused Manson of forcing her to work for two days straight, during which she says she feared Manson's frequent violent and angry outbursts.
Walters accused Manson of pushing her onto his ""influential industry friends and associates,"" including an actor who forcefully kissed her in September 2010. She also claimed that Manson harassed her by forcefully kissing her.
Manson's team denied all of the allegations in both of Walters' lawsuits and asked a judge to dismiss her claims without an opportunity to file another amended complaint.
Attorneys representing Walters and Manson did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Evan Rachel Wood resurge tras denunciar a Marilyn Manson por agresión,"Durante más de cuatro años, justo después de cumplir a mayoría de edad, la actriz Evan Rachel Wood (Estados Unidos, 34 años), mantuvo una relación con un hombre que le doblaba la edad, el cantante Marilyn Manson. Tiempo después ella confesó que durante su convivencia juntos, entre 2006 y 2010, sufrió abusos de todo tipo por parte de él, llegando incluso a la tortura física y mental, encerrada en una mansión de Los Ángeles, atada y sin comida durante días. Renacer de las cenizas, documental dividido en dos entregas, relata de forma exhaustiva su viaje desde el mundo de la interpretación al del activismo contra la violencia doméstica. Cuando ella estuvo preparada para denunciar, descubrió que era demasiado tarde. La ley californiana solo permitía a las víctimas hacerlo en los tres años posteriores a las agresiones, lo que la actriz, con estadísticas en la mano, consideraba insuficiente. Así que decidió cambiar la ley y lo consiguió.
Más información Evan Rachel Wood, la actriz y férrea activista que ha denunciado por abusos a Marilyn Manson
A pesar de que Wood lleva años haciendo públicas esta luchas y sus acusaciones contra Manson, el cantante decidió denunciar por difamación a principios de este mes de marzo, muy pocos días antes de que HBO Max estrenara esta producción en los casi 50 países en los que está presente. Su directora, Amy Berg (Estados Unidos, 51 años), asegura que ni ella, ni la plataforma, ni la protagonista del relato consideraron “ni por un solo momento” frenar la emisión porque el testimonio de Wood “está cargado de pruebas”, cuenta la veterana documentalista al otro lado de la pantalla desde su casa de Los Ángeles, durante una conversación por Zoom.
Marilyn Manson y Evan Rachel Wood, en la época en la que eran pareja. Cordon
Evan Rachel Wood, la protagonista de la serie Westworld (HBO Max), se convirtió en una estrella del cine siendo una adolescente, con Thirteen (2003) y Recortes de mi vida (2013), dos películas independientes que no temían abordar asuntos sórdidos. Esos papeles llenaron a la actriz de etiquetas. Muchas de ellas estaban relacionadas con una sexualidad precoz que no se correspondía con la realidad. Poco después se encontró en una fiesta a Brian Warner, conocido como Marilyn Manson.
Berg tenía mucha curiosidad en este camino en favor de las víctimas de abuso que estaba iniciando la actriz y empezó a seguir sus pasos durante algunos años “sin un plan concreto en mente”, recuerda. Decidió que en su historia había un documental cuando la actriz logró cambiar la ley californiana, ampliando el derecho de denuncia de las víctimas a cinco años. Ese día, su testimonio personal en el Congreso estadounidense fue escuchado de forma masiva y varias mujeres se atrevieron también a alzar la voz contra el cantante. Otro momento clave en este largo proceso personal de Wood fue cuando Dan Cleary, uno de los músicos que acompañaba a Manson en sus giras, publicó en septiembre de 2020 varios mensajes en Twitter refutando la versión de los hechos del cantante.
El camino hacia el cambio
Mientras que el primero de los episodios busca dar un contexto, repasando los detalles de la infancia y adolescencia de su protagonista y su llegada al activismo, el segundo de ellos se centra en las consecuencias de hacer pública su experiencia personal. Uno de los aspectos que convergen en ambas entregas es el enorme cambio experimentado en Estados Unidos tras el movimiento #MeToo del año 2017. En el exhaustivo relato de Wood, recuerda el vídeo musical de Marilyn Manson en el que ella participó en 2007. Se titula Heart-Shaped Glasses, en clara referencia a las gafas con forma de corazón de la Lolita cinematográfica de Stanley Kubrick. La actriz denuncia que fue violada delante de todo un equipo de rodaje sin que nadie hiciera nada al respecto. El músico decidió cambiar sobre la marcha los términos acordados con ella y comenzó a practicar sexo real en vez de fingido ante la cámara sin que su pareja, que en ese instante era una adolescente borracha y drogada, estuviera en condiciones para evitarlo. A pesar de las declaraciones de la intérprete, la grabación sigue colgada en plataformas de vídeo como YouTube.
Evan Rachel Wood, en un momento del documental 'Renacer de las cenizas'.
“En muchos de los abusos que aparecen en mis documentales, la mayoría de los agresores sufrieron a su vez abusos en el pasado”, explica Berg, candidata al Oscar por Líbranos del mal (2006), sobre las agresiones sexuales de un sacerdote católico estadounidense a decenas de niños. “Es muy difícil pensar que casos como el que cuenta Evan Rachel Wood son solo hechos aislados, que no forman parte de una cultura. Es un comportamiento sistemático que la sociedad ha tolerado durante siglos”, argumenta. Pero, a pesar de los avances del movimiento #MeToo, sigue habiendo un camino por recorrer. Berg explica que no pudo incluir en Renacer de las cenizas canciones de otros músicos que comparten discográfica con Manson, porque la compañía, en un intento de proteger a su artista a pesar de las acusaciones masivas que ha recibido, se negó a vender los pertinentes derechos a esta producción de HBO Max. Tras la emisión del documental, tanto ella como Wood han recibido acoso en redes sociales por parte “de una comunidad muy pequeña de gente que es muy persistente y que intenta una y otra vez desacreditar a la víctima”, comenta la directora. “Por otro lado, la cantidad de apoyo que ella ha recibido desde que se estrenó el primer capítulo ha sido enorme”, concluye.

Evan Rachel Wood on Being 'Publicly Gaslit' for Marilyn Manson Claims,"Evan Rachel Wood is opening up about her experience being “publicly gaslit” for coming forward with abuse allegations against Marilyn Manson.
On a new episode of Jameela Jamil’s podcast “I Weigh,” the actor dived deep into the “re-traumatizing” but necessary process of being involved in a sexual abuse investigation.
Manson (real name Brian Hugh Warner) and Wood were publicly in a relationship from 2006 to 2010, and Wood named Manson as her alleged abuser in February 2021. Soon after, the Los Angeles Police Department announced that Manson was under investigation for domestic violence. Wood has recently released a documentary on HBO, “Phoenix Rising,” which follows her journey to pass the Phoenix Act — a bill that extends the statute of limitations in domestic violence — in the California senate. In conversation with Jamil, Wood detailed her experience of being questioned about the alleged abuse.
“After being involved in a large investigation like the one I’m involved in now, I really started to understand why people pull out of investigations and why victims recount their statements and why they go forward and then pull back,” Wood said. “Because man, it’s no joke having to go through the things that have happened to you in excruciating detail. Questions you’ve never been asked. And to have to go back there over and over again, to be publicly gaslit on a large scale or even a small scale, it’s very, very re-traumatizing.”
Wood continued, “I sit here knowing I’m not lying, knowing I’m telling the truth, but people make you feel crazy. So I have to sit there and meditate and go through the things that have happened to me and go, ‘Did this happen to you? Yes. Did this happen? Yes.’ And I go through the details and replay them in my head just so no one can take my truth away from me, because they try, they really try to break you down.”
Manson has vehemently denied all allegations of sexual assault and abuse. In March, he filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood and her partner Ilma Gore, claiming they have “publicly cast” him as a “rapist and abuser — a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV and film career.” In response to the claims made by Wood in “Phoenix Rising,” Manson’s lawyer issued the following statement: “As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted. This is just more of the same. But, then again, what else would you expect from a group who have spread falsehood after falsehood about Brian and even went as far as to forge an FBI letter to further their phony claims?”
In the podcast, Wood also discussed in depth what it was like to finally be free of the relationship. “I was so happy to be out that I just shoved it all down and wanted to forget that it even happened, because the last thing you want to do when you’re finally out of a nightmare is to sit there and study it and relive it for years,” Wood said.” I was like, I just want to go hang out with my friends, I want to go to Disneyland, I want to dance, I want joy again.”
Wood said she initially didn’t intend to come forward with her allegations, but her next relationship made her realize that she had to say something for the sake of her own mental and physical health — and to truly move forward.
“I thought I was going to go to my grave with everything that had happened, and I also had not been out long enough to see through all the gaslighting and manipulation and the grooming that had happened. I really internalized the things that people had projected onto me like, ‘She’s fucking crazy, what is she doing, what’s wrong with her?’ … I thought I deserved it,” Wood said on the podcast. “I then took that with me into my next relationship, where I felt completely unworthy. I was lucky to have someone take me back after I had been so awful. I didn’t realize I had so much work to do until I tried to have another relationship. I realized intimacy was really hard, I would just close my eyes and disconnect… chronic pain all over my body, I felt 80 years old. I would wake up screaming, or I would have these crazy night terrors or I couldn’t sleep.”
Wood’s episode on “I Weigh” marked the two-year anniversary of Jamil’s podcast, which has also hosted guests like Gloria Steinem, Roxane Gay, Jane Fonda, Debra Messing and Reese Witherspoon.

Louis C.K. und Marilyn Manson: Grammy-Gewinner lösen Empörung aus,"Seit er 2017 zugegeben hat, mehrere Frauen sexuell belästigt zu haben, gilt Louis C.K. als gecancelt. Nun gewinnt der US-Komiker jedoch einen Grammy für das beste Comedy-Album. Die Reaktionen auf seinen Sieg lassen nicht lange auf sich warten.
Seit im Jahr 2017 diverse Belästigungsvorwürfe gegen Louis C.K. öffentlich gemacht wurden, ist es still geworden um den US-Comedian. Wie die ""New York Times"" damals berichtete, soll er bei mindestens fünf Frauen, bei denen es sich wohl um Kolleginnen handelte, übergriffig geworden sein und vor ihnen masturbiert haben. Obwohl der Komiker die Vorwürfe später einräumte und sich reumütig zeigte, wurden mehrere geplante Filme und Comedy-Touren mit ihm abgesagt. Seitdem gilt er als ""gecancelt"".
Dass der 54-Jährige nun am Sonntag trotz seiner Vergehen zu den Gewinnern bei den Grammy Awards zählte, stößt vielen Zuschauern sauer auf. Obwohl seine Kategorie nicht im Fernsehen übertragen wurde, setzte er sich bei ""Bestes Comedy-Album"" gegen Mitstreiterinnen und Mitstreiter wie Chelsea Handler, Kevin Hart, Lewis Black, Nate Bargatze und Lavell Crawford durch und wurde für sein Programm ""Sincerly Louis C.K."" ausgezeichnet.
Im Internet empören sich nun viele Menschen - insbesondere Frauen - darüber, dass die sogenannte ""Cancel-Kultur"" offenbar nicht für weiße Männer gelte. Dafür wurden an einigen Stellen auch Parallelen zu den Folgen für Will Smiths Ausraster bei der Oscarverleihung gezogen.
""Louis C.K. hat gerade einen verdammten Grammy gewonnen, während ihr entweder nach Will Smiths Kopf ruft oder über die Cancel-Kultur heult. Es gibt keine Konsequenzen für weiße Cishet-Männer"", schrieb eine Kritikerin etwa. Der Begriff ""Cishet"" ist eine Mischung aus ""Cis"" - Menschen, deren Geschlechtsidentität mit dem Geschlecht übereinstimmt, das ihnen bei ihrer Geburt anhand ihrer Genitalien zugeschrieben wurde - und ""Hetero"".
""Wie kommt es, dass Louis C.K. nicht aus der Recording Academy austreten musste, nachdem er einem Haufen Frauen ohne Zustimmung seinen Schwanz zeigte?"", fragte die Journalistin Mey Rude ebenfalls mit Bezug auf Will Smith, der nach dem Oscar-Zwischenfall aus der Schauspielakademie ausgetreten war.
""Louis C.K. hat gerade einen Grammy gewonnen, also möchte ich kein Gejammer mehr über die Cancel-Kultur hören"", twitterte eine weitere Zuschauerin. ""Männer können Frauen sexuell ausbeuten, die Karriere und das Selbstvertrauen der Opfer können zerstört werden, alles kann an die Öffentlichkeit kommen - und es wird immer noch keine wirklichen Konsequenzen geben.""
""Ich frage mich, ob sich die Karrieren der Komikerinnen, die Louis C.K. gezwungen hat, ihm beim Masturbieren zuzusehen - die angeblich von C.K.s Manager bedroht wurden - von dem Stigma erholt haben"", schrieb die Journalistin Moira Donegan. ""Louis C.K.s eigene Karriere scheint sich sehr gut erholt zu haben.""
Ein weiterer Beobachter, US-Anwalt Max Kennerly, störte sich zudem daran, dass der Comedian die Belästigungsvorwürfe gegen ihn nun als ""sexuelle Vorliebe"" abtue und sich damit als Opfer darstelle. Denn in seinem Programm ""suggeriert Louis C.K., dass er Sympathien verdient, 'weil jeder meine Vorliebe kennt'"", twitterte Kennerly. Es gebe ""keinen Grund für die Akademie, ihm diese Auszeichnung zu verleihen, außer die Nachricht zu senden, dass er nichts falsch gemacht hat.""
In ""Sincerely Louis C.K."" hatte der Comedian den Menschen im Publikum gesagt, wie glücklich sie sich darüber schätzen könnten, dass ihre sexuellen Präferenzen ihre private Angelegenheit seien. ""Jeder kennt meine verdammte Vorliebe jetzt. Obama kennt meine Vorliebe - versteht ihr, wie sich das anfühlt?"", fragte er unter anderem.
Doch Louis C.K. ist nicht der einzige Grammy-Gewinner, an dem sich viele Fans stören. In der Kritik steht auch das Lied ""Jail"" von Kanye West, das in Kooperation mit Marilyn Manson entstand. Mehrere Frauen, darunter die Schauspielerinnen Evan Rachel Wood und Esmé Bianco, werfen dem Schockrocker psychischen und sexuellen Missbrauch vor.
""Louis C.K. hat einen Grammy für das beste Comedy-Album gewonnen, und der Grammy für den besten Rap-Song ging an Kanye Wests 'Jail' mit Marilyn Manson"", hieß es etwa. ""Es gibt keine Cancel-Kultur, wenn Männer Frauen missbrauchen. Wenn Weinstein nicht im Gefängnis säße, würde er wahrscheinlich schon wieder Filme produzieren.""

"Louis CK, Chappelle could receive controversial 2022 Grammys","Controversial entertainers Louis C.K., Kanye West, Dave Chappelle and Marilyn Manson are all up for Grammys at Sunday’s awards ceremony — and a win for any of them could be cringe-worthy.
C.K. — who was accused by several women of sexual misconduct — is up for the award for “Best Comedy Album” for his stand-up performance “Sincerely Louis CK.”
The comedy special was his first since he admitted in 2017 that he masturbated in front of women without their consent.
Also among the embattled nominees is comedian Dave Chappelle, who has faced backlash for transphobic remarks in his Netflix stand-up special “The Closer.”
Chappelle is being considered for “Best Spoken Word Album” for his half-hour set on the police-killing of George Floyd, “8:46.”
Meanwhile, West could be called up to the stage if he wins any of his five award nominations for his 2021 album “Donda” — even though his planned performance at the show was reportedly pulled over “concerning online behavior.”

The rapper has faced scrutiny for harassing his estranged wife Kim Kardashian, cyberbullying Kardashian’s boyfriend, Pete Davidson, and using a racial slur while addressing Grammys host Trevor Noah.
West’s collaborator, Manson — who is accused of being a sexual predator — is also nominated for his work on “Donda,” which is up for the “Album of the Year” category.
At least 15 women have accused Manson of various degrees of sexual, psychological and physical abuse. He has denied all the allegations through his lawyers.

When asked about Manson’s nomination, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said the organization does not weigh personal transgressions when deciding eligibility.
“We won’t restrict the people who can submit their material for consideration. We won’t look back at people’s history, we won’t look at their criminal record, we won’t look at anything other than the legality within our rules of, is this recording for this work eligible based on date and other criteria? If it is, they can submit for consideration,” Mason told TheWrap.
Still, he said the organization may withhold an invitation to a nominee to attend the event.
“What we will control is our stages, our shows, our events, our red carpets. We’ll take a look at anyone who is asking to be a part of that, asking to be in attendance, and we’ll make our decisions at that point. But we’re not going to be in the business of restricting people from submitting their work for our voters to decide on,” he told the outlet.

Grammy Awards 2022: Bannir Kanye West ne gomme pas les polémiques,"MUSIQUE - La polémique de trop. Ce dimanche 3 avril, Kanye West ne se produira pas à Las Vegas sur la scène des Grammy Awards, et ce, alors même que le rappeur américain concourt dans cinq des catégories de la remise de prix, dont celle du meilleur album pour son disque Donda.
La cause? Un “comportement en ligne préoccupant”, a-t-on expliqué par téléphone aux membres de son équipe, dans le courant du mois de mars. Cette décision n’est pas anodine, elle fait suite aux nombreuses controverses qui entourent le musicien depuis de longs mois. Banni d’Instagram pendant 24 heures pour des propos racistes à l’égard de l’animateur des Grammys, Trevor Noah, il est accusé de harceler son ex-femme, Kim Kardashian.
Il n’a pas seulement multiplié les attaques contre elle sur le réseau social, il s’est aussi introduit sans le consentement de cette dernière à l’anniversaire de leur fille, samplé sa voix dans un nouveau morceau et envoyé un camion rempli de fleurs devant chez elle.
Ça n’a rien de mignon. Kim Kardashian, qui avait exhorté la justice de prononcer leur divorce pour pouvoir ”élever paisiblement ses enfants”, partage désormais sa vie avec un autre homme, l’humoriste Pete Davidson. Les menaces de Kanye West contre ce dernier ne manquent pas, comme en témoigne une image d’un de ses derniers clips dans lequel il tue et enterre le comédien du Saturday Night Live.
Outre son soutien à Donald Trump et ses déclarations sur l’esclavage, Kanye West entretient également une relation conflictuelle avec les Grammy Awards depuis longtemps. En 2005, déjà, il s’était plaint de ne pas avoir remporté le prix du meilleur album pour Late Registration. Et en 2015, il avait demandé à ce que Beck donne le sien à Beyoncé, comme un écho à la fois où il en avait fait de même sur la scène des MTV Video Music Awards face à Taylor Swift.
Des polémistes en lice
Cette saison, les Grammys disent non. Ils veulent sans doute se protéger de tout dérapage. Mais voilà, cette décision ne gomme en rien les autres controverses de l’année. À commencer par la nomination de Marilyn Manson qui a contribué au dernier disque de Kanye West.
Visé par un mandat d’arrêt depuis 2019 après une altercation avec un vidéaste, le chanteur fait l’objet de graves accusations d’agressions sexuelles. Alors que les actrices Evan Rachel Wood et Esmé Bianco ont dénoncé publiquement des cas de harcèlement, de viol, de violences répétées ou encore d’abus sexuels sadiques, plusieurs plaintes ont été déposées.
La direction des Grammy Awards à expliquer “ne pas examiner l’histoire des gens” ou “leur casier judiciaire”. “Ce que nous contrôlerons, ce sont nos scènes, nos spectacles, nos événements, nos tapis rouges”, a précisé le directeur de la cérémonie, Harvey Mason Jr.
De son côté, l’humoriste américain Louis C.K., qui a reconnu en 2017 les accusations d’exhibitionnisme le visant, est nommé dans la catégorie du meilleur album de comédie. Dave Chappelle, lui aussi humoriste, figure dans celle du meilleur livre audio.
Star du stand-up aux États-Unis, il a tenu des propos transphobes dans son dernier spectacle sur Netflix, déclenchant par là-même de grandes manifestations face à la complaisance de la plateforme de streaming bien décidée à ne pas retirer le one-man-show de son catalogue. Alors que des employés trans de l’entreprise ont été suspendus après avoir ouvertement dénoncé l’humoriste, Netflix a commandé de nouvelles émissions à Dave Chappelle.
L’absence de Drake
À l’inverse, Drake, lui, a demandé à ce qu’on retire son nom des listes. Le rappeur canadien n’est sous le feu d’aucune accusation. Aucune explication n’a été donnée par l’artiste, dont le dernier album Certified Lover Boy a été un véritable raz de marée. Il s’est écoulé à 613.000 exemplaires la première semaine et plus de 153 millions de streams en 24 heures, mais n’était nommé que dans deux catégories “rap”. Certified Lover Boy n’a été cité dans aucune des catégories dites “généralistes”, de loin les plus en vue.
Ce différend n’est pas une première. Drake s’est déjà accroché avec l’Académie du disque par le passé, qu’il accuse de le snober, et de le cantonner en raison de sa couleur de peau. “C’est un secteur qui dépend parfois d’un petit groupe de personnes ne comprenant pas ce qu’un gamin métis venu du Canada peut avoir à dire”, avait-il lancé en recevant son seul prix de la soirée, lors des Grammy Awards en 2019. Artiste majeur de sa génération, il n’a, jusqu’alors, remporté que quatre trophées.
Sa demande de retrait n’est pas un caprice. D’autres artistes noirs, comme Frank Ocean et Jay-Z, ont également fustigé les choix des Grammys ces dernières années, les accusant de laisser les musiciens non blancs de côté. En 2021, The Weeknd a comparé l’institution à une organisation de “corrompus”, précisant boycotter la cérémonie pour de bon. Herbie Hancock est le dernier musicien noir à avoir, par exemple, décroché le titre de l’album de l’année. C’était en 2008.

Hay una foto que me abochorna. Un perfecto documento de la insondable estupidez humana. En ella poso con sonrisa bobalicona mientras acaricio a un cocodrilo ante un cartel de “No tocar a los cocodrilos”. La he recordado al ver el documental de HBO Max Renacer de las cenizas, en el que Evan Rachel Wood, la divina Dolores Abernathy de la tediosa Westworld, narra los abusos a los que fue sometida por Marilyn Manson.
Conociendo la trayectoria del músico, tienta caer en la culpabilización de sus víctimas. Hay varias. Como me habrían culpado a mí de haber acabado en el intestino del cocodrilo. Preguntarse qué las llevó a los brazos de un tipo cuyo nombre artístico homenajea a un psicópata. Un apologeta de la violencia al que el documental muestra hace 20 años jactándose en televisión de haber torturado a una admiradora sin que a nadie en el plató le cambie el rictus.
Ese dato esconde la respuesta. Durante más de 20 años, Manson ha sido tratado por demasiados como un dios, y a Dios no se le rechaza, recalca Wood. Aunque en muchos momentos del documental más que una deidad parezca un adolescente pajillero que ha visto demasiadas veces Salón Kitty.
Cabe preguntarse por qué somos tan permisivos con los violentos. El lunes pasamos de consternarnos ante una agresión, a escuchar aplausos al agresor. Circulen, no ha pasado nada. Como cuando Kanye West, borracho y furioso, arruinó la fiesta a Taylor Swift sin consecuencias. No las hay en ningún ámbito. Ahí están los arrebatos agresivos de imbéciles como Kyrgios o Djokovic. “Chicos malos” les llaman, ”enfants terribles”. Etiquetas atractivas para maquillar comportamientos peligrosos que justificamos obnubilados por la presunta genialidad de quienes los perpetran. En lugar de alejarlos, los abrazamos con sonrisa bobalicona. Otra muestra de la insondable estupidez humana.

"Marilyn Manson, la disección de un monstruo","Marilyn Manson, la disección de un monstruo HBO Max ha estrenado el documental 'Renacer de las cenizas', en el que la actriz Evan Rachel Wood y otras mujeres víctimas cuentan cómo se convirtieron en víctimas de los abusos del cantante
Nacho Serrano Actualizado: 28/03/2022 00:47h Guardar Enviar noticia por correo electrónico Tu nombre * Tu correo electrónico * Su correo electrónico *
Hubo un momento en el que los fans del rock duro se tomaban a broma a Marilyn Manson. Después de veinte años haciéndose el malote sobre el escenario, sus poses de villano empezaron a hacerse repetitivas y dejaron de resultar perturbadoras, y el artista estadounidense casi se convirtió en una caricatura de sí mismo. Lo que nadie sabía es que era un malvado de verdad, y que detrás de su imagen había una realidad terrible. Al menos eso es lo que aseguran Evan Rachel Wood y otras mujeres víctimas de sus abusos en el documental que acaba de estrenar HBO Max, 'Renacer de las cenizas'. Testimonios de violaciones, agresiones físicas y verbales, privación del sueño, prácticas sexuales sádicas e incluso secuestros inundan el minutaje de esta película de terror dirigida por Amy Berg, cineasta nominada al Oscar en 2006 por 'Líbranos del mal'.
El caso de Evan Rachel Wood resulta especialmente sangrante, ya que según su versión una de las violaciones que sufrió ocurrió durante la grabación del videoclip de 'Heart-Shaped Glasses (When The Heart Guides The Hand)', que puede verse en YouTube. La actriz ha pedido a la plataforma que retire el vídeo alegando que fue 'violada ante la cámara', pero en una declaración ofrecida a 'The Daily Mail', el portavoz de YouTube, Jack Malon, ha dicho que la compañía está «monitoreando la situación de cerca y tomará las medidas apropiadas si determinamos que hay una violación de nuestras directrices de responsabilidad de los creadores», pero argumenta que para ello sería necesario que Manson confesara o fuera acusado o condenado legalmente por un delito que «perjudique a la comunidad de YouTube».
Ese precisamente es otro de los puntos fuertes del documental de HBO Max: la lucha por abrir y mantener un frente judicial sólido contra el artista, que sigue negando los hechos a pesar de que ha sido despedido de su sello discográfico, ha sido abandonado por su mánager de toda la vida, Tony Ciulla, y ha sido expulsado de varios proyectos televisivos, como 'American Gods' y la serie 'Creepshow'. Según Manson, las denunciantes están «buscando cínica y deshonestamente monetizar y explotar el movimiento #MeToo lanzando un ataque coordinado» contra él.
La forja de un monstruo
¿Cómo pudo convertirse Marilyn Manson en el monstruo que denuncian varias de sus exparejas? Brian Hugh Warner nació en Canton (Ohio) el 5 de enero de 1969, como hijo único de Barbara Warner Wyer (fallecida el 13 de mayo de 2014) y Hugh Angus Warner (fallecido el 7 de julio de 2017). Tuvo una infancia de educación cristiana, contra la que pronto se rebelaría convirtiéndose en un adolescente problemático. En 1989, a la edad de veinte años, formó la banda Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids (después acortado a Marilyn Manson), y en 1993 llamó la atención de Trent Reznor de Nine Inch Nails, que produjo y editó su primer disco 'Portrait of an American Family', un éxito de ventas con más de medio millón de copias despachadas. Su estilo fue enmarcado dentro del 'shock rock', creado por artistas como Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Arthur Brown o Screaming Lord Sutch y más tarde desarrollado por Alice Cooper o W.A.S.P., en el que el aspecto teatral juega un papel fundamental. En este sentido, Manson lo llevó un paso más allá recreando escenas sangrientas con un nivel de violencia escénica nunca visto antes en el panorama musical 'mainstream'. El éxito de sus siguientes discos, 'Antichrist Superstar' (1996) y 'Mechanical Animals' (1998), le colocó en la diana de las asociaciones estadounidenses contra las letras violentas en la música, y fue acusado de inspirar la masacre del instituto Columbine en 1999.
En esa época, Manson ya era un agresor sexual según las protagonistas del documental, que aseguran que siguió cometiendo todo tipo de delitos durante los siguientes años. Él ha denunciado a Evan Rachel Wood por difamación, daños emocionales y suplantación de identidad en internet, a lo que la actriz ha contestado: «Obviamente, no puedo hablar de ninguna de las acusaciones específicas de la demanda, pero no estoy asustada. Estoy triste, porque así es como funciona. Esto es lo que sufren casi todos los supervivientes que intentan denunciar a alguien en una posición de poder, y esto es parte de las represalias que mantienen a los supervivientes callados. Por eso la gente no quiere dar la cara. Esto era de esperar. Estoy muy segura de que tengo la verdad de mi lado y que la verdad saldrá a la luz, y que esta denuncia estaba claramente programada para ser interpuesta antes del documental. Hay una razón».
Curiosamente, Manson se implicó en la pasada década en la lucha contra el abuso sexual. En 2013 participó en el evento 'Rumble in the Jumble' de Oxfam, que recaudó dinero para ayudar a las víctimas de abuso doméstico y sexual en la República Democrática del Congo, y tmbién ha trabajado con Project Nightlight, una asociación que alienta a niños y adolescentes a denunciar el abuso físico y sexual. En 2019, actuó junto a Cyndi Lauper en su concierto benéfico anual 'Home for the Holidays', y todas las ganancias se donaron a la fundación True Colors United de Lauper, que trabaja para desarrollar soluciones para los jóvenes LGBTQ sin hogar.",2022-03-27T22:47:31Z,https://www.abc.es,ABC
"Celebrity Deathmatch’s best episodes (and weirdest stories), picked by the creator","In the third episode of Celebrity Deathmatch’s second season, Calista Flockhart slams Lucy Lawless’ head into a copy machine, wraps a telephone cord around her neck, and then bounces off the ropes to deliver a gut-wrenching blow. But right before impact, Lawless bends at the waist and absorbs Flockhart’s literal head of steam right up her ass. In what color commentator Nick Diamond describes as a “devastating rectal clutch,” the deemed-legal move changes the course of the match, and the Xena actress quickly drags Flockhart’s squirming, headless body up to the top rope to slam her way to victory.
One eternal question spans all of pop culture: ""Who would win?” That's why we're dedicating an entire week to debates that have shaped comics, movies, TV, and games, for better and worse. Prepare yourself for Polygon’s Who Would Win Week..
Although there had been plenty of comically repulsive beatings throughout the show’s first season, creator Eric Fogel had never tried something this ... intimate, and assumed MTV would take the move off the air. But to his surprise, the network’s Standards and Practices division approved the segment, suggesting to Fogel and his small team of animators and writers that hardly anything was off-limits in their clay-model world. “There was something funny about over-the-top violence,” Fogel tells Polygon. “I think we were always game to push the envelope and get a reaction from fans. […] I said to myself, ‘If we can get this stuff by, let’s keep pushing it.’”
With each successive versus-driven episode during its original, four-season run from 1998–2002 (and four years later, on its two-season MTV2 reboot), Celebrity Deathmatch did exactly that. Unbound by the laws of physics but tethered closely to tabloid grudges, the stop-motion series was based on a simple, effective premise: “Two celebrities meet in a boxing ring and beat the living shit out of each other.” At least, that’s how Fogel, then a 27-year-old TV animator, pitched his ultraviolent vision to network head Abby Terkuhle. “I went in there with some actual clay puppets and I sort of gave the basic idea,” he says. “It took a while for it to resonate with him until it finally clicked and he sort of realized there was something there.”
Starting with a three-minute proof-of-concept fight between Charles Manson and Marilyn Manson that would air on Cartoon Sushi (an adult-animation showcase anthology), Fogel mined the exaggerated violence of Tom & Jerry and the grounded gruesomeness of Mike Tyson’s then-recent ear-biting spectacle. In the same vein as an HBO Boxing pay-per-view (which included two ringside broadcasters and real referee Mills Lane), Fogel pitted feuding musicians (“James Hetfield vs. Fred Durst”), prestigious filmmakers (“Spike Lee vs. Quentin Tarantino”), and popular boy bands (“The Backstreet Boys vs. NSYNC”) against each other, turning beloved and polarizing celebrities into blood-soaked killing machines. “I was always fascinated with the idea of celebrity and pop culture, and what makes a celebrity,” Fogel says. “I felt like you could get a lot of comedy out of combining some sort of violent event with a stop-motion look to it, and package it in a way that would appeal to a more adult audience.”
In a pre-internet world, Fogel and his handful of writers mostly relied on newsstand magazines and Entertainment Tonight to determine timely matchups and design relevant sight gags. After leaning into the absurdity of opponents with similar last names (“Jim Carrey vs. Mariah Carey,” for example), they expanded to include celebrities with public beefs who might be eager to tear another’s limbs apart. “It was about finding celebrities that had some angle that we could explore — what would make them interesting in the ring?” Fogel says. “So much about the fights was about really figuring out the minutiae of what would happen from moment to moment in the fight itself.”
Building out these fights was tedious and time-consuming, of course. Working inside MTV’s Manhattan offices, Fogel’s animation team built and painted foam-latex bodies with resin heads, moving arms and legs in small increments against the backdrops of a dozen small stages. On average, animators collected around 10 seconds of footage per day — one group might focus on the broadcasters while another simultaneously perfected a kick to the groin — to complete one Deathmatch in two or three weeks. “When someone was working on a particularly gruesome shot, we would all kind of gather into that set to see what was happening,” Fogel says. “By the end of the day, you could make the rounds and it was like Christmas seeing what the hell was going on in these rooms.”
Over the course of its 75 episodes, Celebrity Deathmatch gained a worldwide audience and Entertainment Weekly dubbed Fogel one of the most creative people in television. Beyond its unsightly gags, the series offered sharp cultural criticism and witty takedowns, capturing the ludicrous nature of celebrity disputes. Still, the most enticing element was waiting to see which celebrity would finish the match victorious — something the best episodes made nearly impossible to predict. “Sometimes it was a popularity contest; sometimes we wanted to go for the shock value and just pivot and do something totally unexpected,” Fogel says of choosing a winner. “It just sort of depended on what we thought was going to be fun, funny, and surprising.”
Though MTV announced it was reviving the show with producer Ice Cube in 2018, Fogel says the network, despite its interest, has currently “put a pin” in production. To fill the void, here’s a look back at some of the best Celebrity Deathmatch showdowns — featuring feuding musicians, iconic cartoons and plenty of blood and guts — with commentary and analysis from Fogel himself. Good fight, good night!
“The Spice Girls vs. Hanson” (winner: Marilyn Manson)
The unofficial Celebrity Deathmatch pilot, this matchup filled out MTV’s alternate Super Bowl halftime show programming. “They said they wanted the two biggest names in pop music right now, which was Hanson and the Spice Girls. That ends up being eight characters in the ring,” Fogel laughs. “It was just me and my coworker Greg Pair animating almost around the clock for three weeks straight to get this thing finished.”
Understandably, the animation here isn’t as crisp as it is in future seasons, but it still boasts a devastating body blow and shocking finale. At one point, two Hanson brothers split Sporty Spice apart at the torso, which doesn’t seem to faze her. Moments later, Marilyn Manson, hiding in the rafters with a chainsaw, cuts down the metal lighting rig and obliterates all of the combatants. In his post-match interview, Manson explains his actions with a simple rationale: “Because I’m the most evil man in America.” Well, that and “their music sucks.”
“Scott Stapp vs. Eddie Vedder” (winner: Eddie Vedder)
In this classic pairing of lead vocalists, the ring is surrounded by salt-coated barbed wire that’s weaponized to a cringe-worthy degree. After beating up a Ticketmaster executive, Vedder accuses Stapp of stealing his voice and slides Stapp’s belly across the spiky ropes, which Vedder later cuts up to floss the Creed singer’s throat. When Stapp tries to sing, his gravelly voice invokes the ire of similar-sounding Tom Waits, who enters the ring and ends Stapp’s life to crown Vedder the winner. “That’s one of these cases where the surprise of the whole thing is bringing in a third party to really throw a wrench in things,” Fogel says. “It’s the perfect example of bringing in the ultimate raspy-throated crooner to really lay down the hammer.”
Perhaps more than any other prop used on the series, the barbed wire might be the most visceral. Even Fogel admits that digesting the scene is rough by today’s animated standards. “As a young adult, some of my favorite films were Evil Dead II, which is almost a live-action cartoon, and RoboCop, [which] was a big inspiration for me in terms of this ultra-violence,” he says. “The comedy gets magnified the more violent you make it in stop-motion, because you know these aren’t living things — they’re toys, and eviscerating them brings out the little kid in me.”
“Beavis vs. Butthead” (winner: Beavis)
Mike Judge gave his blessing for this matchup, which begins with Beavis and Butthead as cartoons in a three-dimensional ring. Though Judge was too busy working on King of the Hill to supply their voices, Fogel found a good double and brought in the show’s original animators to put together the two-dimensional portions of the fight. “Everything was very carefully storyboarded out, and then we’re shooting the background plates and then we would have to go in and layer in the 2D on top of it,” Fogel says. “It’s one of my favorite Deathmatches.”
Near the end of the fight, a handless Beavis turns into his “Cornholio” alter-ego, giving him enough deranged energy to slice up Butthead into a pile of guts. “Cornholio was iconic and we kind of knew we wanted to end with the coup-de-gras moment, because we just knew we’d get such a huge reaction from that,” Fogel says. “Sadly, Butthead had to take one for the team.”
“General Ulysses S. Grant vs. General Robert E. Lee” (winner: Ulysses S. Grant)
For season 4, episode 12, Fogel created a series of fights to comprise a special North vs. South edition, beginning with “Derek Jeter vs. John Rocker” and culminating with a pair of Civil War generals. The latter end up slicing each with their swords until they’re both just a pair of thumbs, at which point Grant squashes Lee to give the North a 2-to-1 series victory. “We felt justified in having the North over the South, just in keeping with history,” Fogel laughs.
In addition to packing in some historical references, the fight was another example of the craftsmanship needed to pull off a legitimate-looking duel. “We did make changes and got a little more sophisticated with the effects,” Fogel says. “We bolstered our design team so that when we would have a specific gag, we could actually have someone design all of the different key clay poses ahead of time — depending on the nature of the gag, you could have some really good control that way.”
“Kid Rock vs. Eminem” (winner: Joe C.)
Occasionally, Celebrity Deathmatch would swap out Mills Lane for a guest referee. In the case of “Kid Rock vs. Eminem, Carson” Daly took on officiating duties, turning the broadcast into a TRL-style show called Total Request Dead. “We did a couple Halloween episodes where we would call in The Undertaker to call a fight, so it was always fight-specific,” Fogel says. “Sometimes if there was a fan who would reach out to us, we could always bring them in, too, and just have fun and be a third voice in there.”
To liven up this fight between the two Michigan rap stars, Fogel brought in Kid Rock’s hype man Joe C. to tear apart both musicians. “That’s just like a rapper to use somebody else’s body of work to make a hit,” chirps Diamond, who often became a frequent source of punny punditry beside his broadcast partner Johnny Gomez. “At first we wanted to have them be the straight men, taking this very seriously,” Fogel says. “But as the seasons went on, we went more into the dynamics of Nick and Johnny. That was an unexpected treat.”
“Courtney Love vs. Dave Grohl” (winner: Dave Grohl)
Before this deathmatch even starts, Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corrigan’s head gets splattered by the “Dome of Devastation,” effectively a metal cage, and Grohl gets pounded by Mentos on his walk to the ring (a very ‘90s pop-cultural event that happened). That’s nothing compared to Courtney Love’s return from the dead, though, thanks to Mad Scientist Stone Cold Steve Austin. “He would take the DNA of these celebrities and combine them to form new characters, something we brought into those later episodes, just to have a little more fun and push things a little further,” Fogel says. “She was one of the victims.”
The matchup leaned into the controversy surrounding the lawsuits between Love and Grohl, and eventually the Foo Fighters frontman ended her life by dropping a grand piano on top of her. Though Fogel received a few complaints from celebrities about their depictions, he felt most were honored to be featured, win or lose.
“The best example for me is getting a letter from Steven Spielberg, who lost in his fight to Alfred Hitchcock,” Fogel says. “He wrote us requesting a rematch and telling us he was going to bring his T-Rex and Great White Shark and we should accept the challenge.

Es muy interesante cómo el filme desbroza los elementos que convergen en la seducción que Manson ejerció sobre ella. Y tienen que ver con la sexualización intensiva de la que la actriz, apenas una adolescente cuando empezó en el cine, fue objeto por parte de la maquinaria de Hollywood: papeles que explotaban su aspecto de niña y que la mostraban con muchísimo más descaro y madurez que los que ella tenía en la vida real; reportajes de moda con ropa que no le correspondía, y la guinda: el encuentro con un hombre veinte años mayor (ella tiene 18; él, 37 cuando empiezan a salir), al que ella admira y –la gran trampa– que la hace sentirse especial, elegida...
Hablando con víctimas de abusos sexuales en la adolescencia, ese es el término que sale una y otra vez: un hombre mayor al que admiras se fija en ti, empieza a cortejarte, te seduce. Te bombardea con cartas de amor, detalles, regalos. Te dice que tú le has descubierto lo que es el amor. Te crees la única, la elegida, te sientes especial. Es un patrón que se repite en millones de casos en la realidad. En cambio, en la ficción, el espacio está ocupado por el dañino mito de Lolita, la preadolescente perversa que seduce al adulto y le trae de cabeza. No me malinterpreten: a mí Nabokov me parece un escritor excelso y Lolita, una gran novela. Lo que ocurre es que, por desgracia, ha cimentado un mito que ha servido para que los depredadores, indefectiblemente, se atribuyan el papel de víctimas: son 'ellas' las que los han seducido, son 'ellas' las que les han destrozado la vida, son 'ellas' las abusadoras, las perversas, las culpables. Que es justamente lo que Marilyn Manson está diciendo en su defensa. Y lo dice con toda la desfachatez del mundo, no sólo ante las acusaciones de Evan Rachel Wood, sino de todas las mujeres que lo han acusado, cuyas historias coinciden casi literalmente y que corroboran absolutamente las declaraciones de la actriz.
En el rodaje, Wood y Manson van a fingir que tienen sexo, pero Manson decide no fingir y viola a la actriz para las cámaras. ¿Por qué nadie del equipo paró el rodaje?
Uno de los momentos más terribles ocurre durante la grabación de un videoclip para un tema del cantante. Se supone que en el rodaje Wood y Manson van a fingir que tienen sexo, pero Manson decide no fingir y viola a la actriz para las cámaras, cuando eso no era lo pactado. No puedes menos que preguntarte por qué nadie de los numerosos miembros del equipo paró el rodaje o se cercioró de que el acto sexual era consentido o dijo algo. Algo.
Mucha gente se preguntará por qué ella misma no paró los hechos. Pero ahí está el quid de la cuestión, como la misma Evan Rachel Wood dice: era un rodaje y «la niña que había crecido entre cámaras sólo sabía parar cuando un director dice 'cut'; nadie me había enseñado a defenderme, sólo a obedecer». La canción se llama Gafas en forma de corazón. Las malditas gafas de Lolita.",2022-03-23T10:52:43Z,https://www.abc.es,ABC
Thousands Are Asking YouTube To Remove A Marilyn Manson Video Over Its Alleged Depiction Of Sexual Assault,"The past year has seen Evan Rachel Wood and Marilyn Manson’s former relationship put under various moral and legal microscopes, though without much resolution stemming from it all at this point. Wood’s two-part documentary Phoenix Rising aired in mid-March 2022 on HBO, having debuted earlier in the year at the Sundance Film Festival, and sparked a lawsuit from Manson’s legal team. While all of that is happening on the main stage, so to speak, Wood’s supporters are attempting to scrub the Internet of a specific music video from the rock star that allegedly features the Westworld actress being sexually assaulted.
A petition was started on Change.org with the overall goal of removing Marilyn Manson’s 2007 music video for the single “Heart-Shaped Glasses (When The Heart Guides The Hand)” from YouTube , with other music services being added in after the initial posting. The video was filmed in 2007 when Manson (real name Brian Warner) and Evan Rachel Wood were dating, and made waves at the time for seemingly depicting the couple engaging in legitimate sexual acts. While it was denied at the time by Wood, and seemingly shrugged off by Manson, Wood has since claimed she was given absinthe ahead of filming, and that the physical acts seen therein were non-consensual and to be considered sexual assault. Due to the statute of limitations having passed, however, she has been unable to do anything about it from a legal standpoint.
While Marilyn Manson has denied all claims of sexual abuse regarding the music video’s filming — as well as the various other rape and assault allegations made against him by Wood and several other women — the attention surrounding the video and its production has only grown. And so fans and supporters of the actress, as well as fellow survivors, allies and advocates, are attempting to remove the video from not only YouTube, but also other mainstream services where the song and/or video can be seen or heard, with TIDAL, Apple Music and Spotify being added onto the petition a few days after it was first posted.
The petition claims the video violates several of YouTube’s Community Guidelines and Policies, including the below:
Pornography or depicting sexual acts, genitals, or fetishes for the purpose of sexual gratification on any surface (such as video, text, audio, images)
Nudity or partial nudity for the purpose of sexual gratification
Non-consensual sex acts or unwanted sexualization
Violent, graphic, or humiliating fetish content where the purpose is sexual gratification
There is an additional hope that YouTube and other services would remove Marilyn Manson’s channels and hubs altogether, but this would take even more of an effort, and would likely need legal ramifications to come into play. It’s noted that there’s a reported clause in YouTube’s terms of service that specify how channels can be removed due to a subject’s actions away from the platform, but it would likely require Manson’s conviction or confession, which would then need to be judged on how much it “harms the YouTube community.”
At the time of this writing, the Change.org petition has reached over 43,000 supporters as it attempts to hit the 50,000-signature goal. It’s unclear what could happen at that point if and when the goal is reached, as far as whether or not YouTube execs and others will be convinced to remove “Heart Shaped Glasses” from their platforms.",2022-03-22T14:39:11Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Evan Rachel Wood violée sur un clip de Marilyn Manson : cette conséquence glauque contre laquelle elle lutte,"Depuis qu'elle a accusé Marilyn Manson de l'avoir violée sur un clip, Evan Rachel Wood subit une terrible conséquence. L'actrice a dénoncé la ""curiosité morbide"" de certains internautes.
""J'ai été contrainte à un acte sexuel commercial sous un prétexte fallacieux"". Dans le documentaire Phoenix Rising, diffusé sur HBO, Evan Rachel Wood a accusé Marilyn Mason de l'avoir violée. Alors en couple, il l'aurait pénétrée sans son consentement sur le clip de Heart-Shaped Glasses, en 2007. ""J'ai été contrainte à un acte sexuel commercial sous un prétexte fallacieux. (...) J'ai été violée devant une caméra, accuse-t-elle. C'était un chaos total. Je ne me sentais pas en sécurité. Personne ne me protégeait. Tourner ce clip a été une expérience vraiment traumatisante. Je peux dire que l'équipe était très embarrassée et que personne ne savait quoi faire."" Depuis la diffusion de ce documentaire, Evan Rachel Wood est confrontée à une terrible conséquence. Les chiffres du clip en question ont explosé pour atteindre 32 millions de vues.
Dans les colonnes de The Cut, Evan Rachal Wood a dénoncé la ""curiosité morbide"" de certains internautes. ""Il y a une humiliation qui va avec"", a regretté l'actrice. Dans la foulée, elle a partagé le lien d'une pétition intitulée ""Supprimer la vidéo de l'agression sexuelle d'Evan Rachel Wood de TOUTES les plateformes de vidéo/diffusion"" et signée par 43.238 internautes. Mais faire plier Youtube ne va pas être aisé. ""Nous surveillons la situation de près et prendrons les mesures appropriées si nous déterminons qu'il y a une violation de nos directives de responsabilité des créateurs"", a réagi Jack Malon, le porte-parole de la plateforme. Selon les règles de YouTube, le seul moyen de retirer la vidéo serait que Marilyn Manson avoue le viol dont l'accuse Evan Rachel Wood dans la vidéo ou bien soit condamné.
Marilyn Manson parle d'un ""mensonge éhonté""
Depuis la prise de parole de son ex-compagne, le chanteur se fait très discret. ""Ce n'est qu'un mensonge éhonté facile à discréditer, car il y a de multiples témoins. Mon client n'a pas eu de relation sexuelle avec Evan sur le tournage, et elle sait qu'il s'agit de la vérité, avait réagi son avocat auprès de People. (...) Evan était cohérente et investie pendant les trois jours d'enregistrement mais aussi très impliquée durant les semaines de pré-production et post-production pour faire le montage. La scène de sexe simulé a été tournée des heures avec un grand nombre de prises, différents angles et plusieurs longues pauses entre les installations des caméras."" Marilyn Manson, qui nie en bloc les accusations de la comédienne et d'autres femmes, fait l'objet d'une enquête diligentée par la police de Los Angeles.

Evan Rachel Wood claims Marilyn Manson made her wait on him after abortion and raped her,"Something went wrong, please try again later.
Want all the latest Showbiz news direct to your inbox? Share your email for news, gossip and more
Evan Rachel Wood has made new accusations against her former partner Marilyn Manson - claiming the singer raped her in her sleep and drugged her with sleeping pills.
The actress, 34, has also alleged her former boyfriend made her prepare his meals immediately after she terminated a pregnancy.
Evan's new public claims are made in her new two-part documentary about her relationship with Marilyn, Phoenix Rising.
The premiere of the HBO series comes after it was reported Marilyn - real named Brian Warner - has filed a lawsuit against Evan.
The Tainted Love singer, 53, alleges in a new lawsuit that his former partner conspired with her on-again, off-again girlfriend to commit fraud and develop a conspiracy in order to defame him, according to PageSix.

Speaking in Phoenix Rising, Evan recalls learning she had fallen pregnant with her then-boyfriend's baby while working on location for the Mildred Pierce series.
""From the beginning of our relationship, he always had an issue with whatever birth control I was using — and I went through, like, every type to see which one he liked, and he didn’t like any of them, so essentially he didn’t want me using birth control,"" she claims in the documentary.
The actress then went on to explain that once she realised she was pregnant, she made the decision to terminate the pregnancy and was 'terrified' by Marylin's requests after she underwent the abortion.

""He flew out for the abortion,"" Evan recalls in the series.
""The second it was over it was like, 'Make me dinner' and I remember being like, 'I’m supposed to be resting — my body has gone through this trauma … there’s an aftermath here.' And he didn’t care.""
Evan then alleges the experience drove her to suicidal intentions and says she went into the bathroom and self-harmed with shattered glass.
After her suicide attempt was unsuccessful, the star claims the incident triggered her to start 'rebuilding her life' and called her mum to help her access medical assistance.

The True Blood actress has also accused her ex-boyfriend of drugging her with sleeping pills at times during their relationship and claims he would use it as an opportunity to sleep with her while she was unconscious.
""This is also when he started raping me in my sleep,"" she says.
""I’d wake up, I just remember doing the mental math quickly and thinking, Just stay, just stay asleep, don’t move, just don’t move'.""
The actress added: ""So I would just lie limp and still until it was over, and then I swear to God, he would just fling my leg and walk out of the room.""
The Mirror has contacted a representative for Marilyn Manson for comment.

In 2018, Evan appeared in front of Congress in support of the nationwide implementation of the Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights Acts, recalling her own experience of abuse at the hands of an unnamed abuser.
After speculation led to many to believe Marilyn was the abuser, a representative for the singer released a statement in November 2020, saying: ""Unfortunately, we live in a time where people believe what they read on the Internet, and feel free to say what they want with no actual evidence.
""The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non fact based information is wholly irresponsible.""
(Image: ABC)
In February 2021, Evan named Marilyn as her alleged abuser via her Instagram account, where four other women also made allegations against the singer.
Marilyn has always denied all allegations of abuse and wrongdoing attributed to him and reportedly launched legal action against his ex-girlfriend earlier this month.
In the complaint, filed on 2 March 2022, Manson alleges that the Frozen 2 actress is guilty of intentionally inflicting emotional distress, defamation, impersonation and violating the Computer Data and Access Fraud Act.
Lawyers for the singer allegedly claim that their client's ex-girlfriend never accused the singer of abuse during their time together from 2006 until 2010.
Responding to the lawsuit, Evan said she was confident the ""truth will come out"".
Speaking on The View last week, ahead of the release of her documentary Phoenix Rising, she said: ""I can't, obviously, speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I am not scared.""

Le combat d’Evan Rachel Wood contre Marilyn Manson,"Depuis presque 30 ans, Marilyn Manson incarne un personnage de cauchemar dans l’univers musical américain, au grand plaisir de ses fans.
J’ai toujours trouvé qu’il y avait quelque chose d’un peu poseur et grand guignol dans son art, mais j’appréciais son envie de déranger en étant l’un des rares à reprendre le flambeau de la provocation horrifiante, dans de grandes messes spectaculaires qui utilisaient parfois l’imagerie nazie. Comme le groupe Kiss, genre, en beaucoup plus sombre. Ses admirateurs, et l’industrie en général, ont toujours fait la part des choses entre l’homme, né Brian Warner, et son personnage, dont le nom est inspiré de l’actrice Marilyn Monroe et du psychopathe Charles Manson.
Jouer au monstre ne fait pas de vous un monstre, mais après avoir vu Phoenix Rising, le documentaire en deux parties d’Amy J. Berg (réalisatrice de Deliver Us from Evil sur les scandales sexuels de l’Église catholique, sélectionné aux Oscars en 2006), on se dit que oui, ce type-là est bel et bien un monstre, finalement. Un autre, malheureusement. Cette production offerte sur HBO et Crave donne la parole à la comédienne Evan Rachel Wood, qui raconte les sévices qu’elle a subis aux mains de Marilyn Manson, dont elle a été la conjointe de 2007 à 2010.
Désolé, votre navigateur ne supporte pas les videos
La première partie de Phoenix Rising, présentée au début de l’année au festival du film de Sundance, a fait grand bruit, car Wood avait révélé publiquement en 2021 le nom de son agresseur dont elle parlait depuis quelques années dans son combat pour faire changer les lois sur les victimes de violence conjugale, notamment lorsqu’elle a témoigné devant le Congrès américain en 2018. Beaucoup de femmes veulent que soit augmenté le délai de prescription dans les cas où cela peut prendre des années avant que les victimes aient le courage de dénoncer, tellement la peur, la honte et le traumatisme les tétanisent.
Juste avant la diffusion sur HBO, Marilyn Manson a déposé une poursuite en diffamation contre Evan Rachel Wood et sa partenaire Illma Gore, qu’on voit dans le documentaire. Selon Manson, il s’agit d’allégations complètement inventées pour le détruire et il demande un procès devant jury pour laver sa réputation. Il dit avoir en sa possession des preuves pour le disculper.
Depuis la sortie d’Evan Rachel Wood, une douzaine de femmes ont accusé Marilyn Manson d’agressions physiques et de harcèlement psychologique, dont quatre ont déposé des plaintes. Mais Manson nie tout et soutient qu’elles ont été recrutées par Wood et Gore, qui auraient scénarisé leurs témoignages.
La bataille est donc officiellement lancée, mais on se demande comment Manson va s’en sortir après avoir vu une réunion de ses victimes, dont Wood, se faisant part de leur expérience éprouvante avec lui. D’autant que parmi elles se trouve Dan Cleary, collaborateur de l’artiste sur ses tournées, qui confirme leurs dires et révèle en passant que Manson piratait les données privées de son entourage avec son WiFi. « Elles ne mentent pas », dit-il.
Mais la réalisatrice Amy Berg suit essentiellement le parcours d’Evan Rachel Wood avant qu’elle ne balance le nom de Manson sur les réseaux sociaux, ultime et dernier moment du documentaire où la jeune femme se libère, non sans fondre en larmes. On la comprend, car ce qu’elle raconte est épouvantable.
Elle n’avait que 18 ans lorsqu’elle a rencontré Manson, qui en avait 36, alors qu’ils étaient tous les deux déjà en couple. La star de Westworld venait de connaître le succès avec le film Thirteen, lui était déjà un dieu de la musique. Outre la différence d’âge, à peu près tous les modèles habituels d’une relation toxique sont présents – lavage de cerveau, isolement, chantage, emprise – avec une couche supplémentaire de sadisme à la Manson, car il y aurait eu viols, torture, scarifications, drogues administrées à son insu, obligation de boire son sang… la liste est longue et consternante.
Elle l’accuse aussi de l’avoir violée sur le plateau de tournage du vidéoclip Heart-Shaped Glasses, qu’elle souhaite voir retirer du web, et ceux qui l’appuient militent de plus en plus pour que cela se fasse.
« L’agression était un art pour lui », résume Evan Rachel Wood, qui aurait subi un avortement sous pression, ce qui l’a menée à entretenir des pensées suicidaires. Elle affirme qu’une façon pour Manson de faire taire les gens de son entourage était de les obliger à dire des injures racistes et antisémites devant une caméra, ce qui pouvait éventuellement être utilisé contre eux. « C’est un loup habillé en loup, il lui est facile de se cacher », note le frère de l’actrice. « Il a peur que les survivantes s’organisent », souligne Illma Gore. Evan Rachel Wood dit avoir reçu plusieurs menaces de Manson, qui voulait s’en prendre à sa famille.
Le masque de Marilyn Manson est en train de tomber, mais cela ne se fera pas facilement, car il est en mode contre-attaque, et beaucoup de ses fans veulent le soutenir en semant le doute sur le web. C’est un phénomène auquel nous commençons à être habitués chaque fois qu’une vedette tombe de son piédestal.
Est-ce que Marilyn Monroe était la façade glamour de Brian Warner et Charles Manson, la véritable influence de sa personnalité, qui tend vers les dérapages des gourous imbus d’eux-mêmes et de leur puissance sur les autres ? Il ne serait pas le premier à en avoir profité. C’est en suivant cette bataille que nous le saurons, car elle ne fait que commencer. Pour lui. Parce que ça fait déjà un bout de temps qu’Evan Rachel Wood se bat non seulement pour elle-même, mais pour toutes les victimes.
Phoenix Rising est offert sur HBO et sur Crave.",2022-03-21T12:15:00Z,https://www.lapresse.ca,La Presse
Evan Rachel Wood’s Marilyn Manson doc shows the messy timeline of healing,"There’s a running theme in Phoenix Rising, the two-part documentary on Evan Rachel Wood’s story of domestic and sexual abuse by shock rocker Marilyn Manson, of evidence. Wood, a 34-year-old actor, has old photos from the early stages of her relationship with Manson, whom she met as an 18-year-old in 2006 (he was 37) – cherubic and teenage before, atrophied and vacant after.
The film selects from journal entries recounting her emotions as he turned her against friends and family. There are so many press and paparazzi photos of them together, which makes public fascination with the pair – a gorgeous Hollywood Lolita with middle America’s nightmare in goth makeup – feel even more queasy now. During filming from 2019 until Wood publicly named Manson, given name Brian Warner, on Instagram in February 2021, several other women and former Manson associates come forward with details either mirroring her experience or corroborating her memories riddled by the repetitive trauma, sleep deprivation and drugs she says Manson forced on her.
I can’t stop thinking about this evidence; most women don’t have near the documentation Wood does, as confirmation or support for their own memories, let alone as material for authorities. As we have seen time and again with first-person accounts stemming from the revelations of the #MeToo movement, there is power and catharsis in disclosure, in telling one’s story. But for all Wood’s personal testimony, her processing of years of memories through the language of trauma and therapy for herself and for us, the pursuit of legal action – the backbone of Phoenix Rising’s narrative – comes down to documentation, files, photos, a case.
As the star of HBO’s Westworld, Wood has considerable power in her own right, and little incentive to accuse Manson for the sake of publicity, as he has claimed in a defamation lawsuit filed earlier this month (conveniently timed, as Wood told The Cut earlier this week, to the release of the documentary). So it’s disheartening to see, over the course of three hours of film covering months of working through the system, how little changes and how much comes back down to perceived trustworthiness of one’s story. To date, 16 women have accused Manson, 53, of sexual abuse – including the Game of Thrones actor Esme Bianco, whose story shares striking similarities with Wood’s – and four have sued for sexual assault. Manson has denied all allegations and has not been charged with a crime. His defamation lawsuit alleges Wood and her friend, the activist Ilma Gore, concocted a conspiracy to defame him and forged an FBI letter to shore up Wood’s allegations. (Gore, Wood told the Cut, is no longer affiliated with The Phoenix Act, Wood’s nonprofit to change the statute of limitations on abuse cases.)
Phoenix Rising, directed by the Oscar-nominated Amy Berg (An Open Secret, The Case Against Adnan Syed), is the latest in a wave of documentary projects in the #MeToo era that uncovered patterns of abuse by beloved public figures, traced the long shadow of sexual trauma, and outlined the cultures that turned a blind eye. This includes Leaving Neverland, the 2019 HBO series on two thorough accounts of alleged child sexual abuse by Michael Jackson; Catch and Kill: The Podcast Tapes, on Ronan Farrow’s 2017 investigation of Harvey Weinstein, which helped ignite the outpouring of recognition that became #MeToo; On the Record, which follows former Def Jam executive Drew Dixon as she contemplates telling her story of alleged rape by music mogul Russell Simmons to the New York Times. There’s Lifetime’s Surviving R Kelly, Showtime’s We Need to Talk About Cosby, and Athlete A, on the journalists, lawyers and gymnasts who exposed the systemic of abuse of cover-up of USA gymnastics doctor Larry Nasser. HBO’s Allen v Farrow, released last year, was both an investigation into allegations that director Woody Allen molested his daughter Dylan and a personal account of Dylan’s life warped by trauma, processing, and years of public scorn and dismissal.
Some of these projects strike the balance between messiness of experience, the often cyclical nature of pain and abuse, and clarity of ethics better than others. Some are justifiably postured against retaliation. All deal with the legal and emotional consequences of coming forward against a prominent person. Different alleged crimes and context, of course, but they’re all dealing, fundamentally, with intimate trauma: how it presents and morphs, how one lives with it, how long it takes to begin to understand.
Wood’s allegations are, to be clear, consistently horrifying. Among them: that Manson repeatedly drugged, manipulated and coerced her on the set of his 2007 music video Heart-Shaped Glasses and “essentially raped” her on camera; that Manson controlled her eating, raped her in her sleep after he gave her a sleeping pill, tortured her with an electric shocking device, beat her with “a Nazi whip from the Holocaust” while she was tied to a kneeler and fed her meth and other drugs without her knowledge. In concert with several other women, some of whom appear in the film in a meet-up, Wood outlines a pattern of love-bombing, isolation, control and abuse.
Phoenix Rising, like the others, hinges on disclosure, the catharsis that is telling one’s story, and the tricky navigation of publicity. But it also feels like the outer limit of what a #MeToo documentary can do. Five years of listening, five years of hearing the same type of patterns and recognizing how predators operate within cultures and systems, how messy one’s personal life can be and still not detract from the violation. What do we do now? As the documentary depicts, Wood was successful in getting the Phoenix Act passed in California, which raised the statute of limitations on domestic violence felonies from three to five years and required police officers to undergo more training on intimate partner violence. She cooperates with a Los Angeles police investigation into Manson and gives an interview to the FBI, shown wordlessly in the film.

But still it comes down to attention. By film’s end, fearful for her safety and hiding out with her child in Tennessee, Wood decides that issuing a public statement is the best course forward. “If there’s not public outrage about this and about the crimes that he’s committed, and if there aren’t people coming forward, then there’s no real incentive for law enforcement to do something,” she says over footage of her drafting a grenade of an Instagram post. “And we could just be waiting in line at the DMV for two years waiting for something to happen.”
The Phoenix Act seems eminently reasonable, an opportunity to better shape laws to the human experience and what these films, long-form investigations, podcast, testimonials hammer home again and again: trauma is messy, idiosyncratic, mutable, chameleonic. One’s ability to see clearly is a slow process even with the privilege of therapy and time. “People underestimate the power of that kind of trauma and what it does to your body and your brain,” Wood told Trevor Noah on the Daily Show this week. “This is what the laws do not reflect: the effects of trauma on the brain.”
Wood was in Manson’s orbit for close to four years; when she began work on the Phoenix Act amid the #MeToo movement, the statute of limitations in California was one to three years. “One to three years is nothing to a survivor,” she told Noah. “It’s nowhere near enough.”
Manson is still free (and collaborating with Kanye West), as is his right, given that he’s never been charged with or convicted of a crime. Phoenix Rising, for all its messy and compelling personal elements, ultimately jabs at that fact. When the criminal justice system doesn’t account for the long tail of trauma, what do you do? What is fair, what is right? And is it worth it? Five years and many thematically similar documentaries in, we still don’t have good answers.",2022-03-18T13:35:06Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian

But in a new two-part HBO documentary called Phoenix Rising, she claims the shock rocker raped her on camera, sexually penetrating her against her will.
The actress said she had not consented to perform a real sex act for the video.
“We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that,” she said.

“I’m a professional actress, I have been doing this my whole life, I’d never been on a set that unprofessional in my life up until this day.
“It was complete chaos, and I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me.
“I felt disgusting and like I had done something shameful, and I could tell that the crew was very uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do.
“I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretences.

“That’s when the first crime was committed against me and I was essentially raped on camera.”
Since the actress made the shocking claim, a Change.org petition has been signed by thousands of people demanding that the video be removed from YouTube.
“While she might not be able to charge him as the statute of limitations has passed, this video should not be on the internet,” the petition states.
“Survivors and allies need to come together to remove things like this.

“Evan has re-victimised herself over and over again to create change and a statute of limitations in the state of California, and doesn’t deserve a constant reminder of her sexual assault on the internet.”
Evan and Marilyn Manson, real name Brian Warner, were in a relationship for four years, beginning in 2006 when she was 18 and he was 37.
She has since raised numerous allegations against the controversial singer, including that he began “grooming” her as a teenager and had “horrifically” abused her both sexually and emotionally during their time together.

“I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission,” she wrote on Instagram in February last year.
“I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.
“I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries who have enabled him before he ruins any more lives.
“I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.”
Marilyn Manson has denied all allegations against him.

Evan Rachel Wood Wants Marilyn Manson Video Removed From YouTube Amid Rape Allegations,"The legal battle between Marilyn Manson and Evan Rachel Wood has taken yet another turn now that the actress is calling for YouTube to step in. Wood has been unrelenting in her accusations about her ex as she has accused him of sexual assault, abuse, and rape—allegations that Manson has repeatedly denied. In her documentary Phoenix Rising, Wood expands on her accusations and includes other women who are alleged victims of Manson, but recently, she claimed that while on the set of ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)"" back in 2007, the rocker raped her during a scene.
""Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the 'Heart-Shaped Glasses' music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses,"" a statement from Manson's attorney read.

The statement continued: ""Evan was not only fully coherent and engaged during the three-day shoot but also heavily involved in weeks of pre-production planning and days of post-production editing of the final cut. The simulated sex scene took several hours to shoot with multiple takes using different angles and several long breaks in between camera setups. Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.""
According to Pitchfork, Wood is now petitioning for YouTube to remove the video and the platform has issued a response via a spokesperson.
“We’re monitoring the situation closely and will take appropriate action if we determine there is a breach of our creator responsibility guidelines,” YouTube shared. Meanwhile, Manson has sued Wood for defamation and shared the court documents publicly.

"As Evan Rachel Wood Calls to Remove Marilyn Manson Video With Alleged Sexual Assault, YouTube “Monitoring the Situation”","Note: This article discusses alleged sexual assault.
In the Amy Berg–directed documentary Phoenix Rising, which aired this week on HBO, Evan Rachel Wood alleged that she was “essentially raped on camera” by Marilyn Manson during the filming of the music video for his 2007 single “Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand).” On Wednesday (March 16) in an Instagram story, Wood shared a petition calling for YouTube to remove that video. The video is still available on the service, and according to a YouTube representative, it isn’t coming down at this time.
“We’re monitoring the situation closely and will take appropriate action if we determine there is a breach of our creator responsibility guidelines,” YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon said in a statement.
YouTube’s community guidelines and terms of service dictate that a user can have monetization suspended or their channel terminated if their behavior away from the platform “harms” YouTube users, their monetization or channel may be suspended. According to YouTube, a video could be removed in the event of a relevant conviction, confession, or legal ruling.
A confession appears unlikely from Manson, who recently sued Wood for defamation just prior to the televised premiere of Phoenix Rising. Manson’s attorney previously issued a statement denying Wood’s claims about the video.
Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the “Heart-Shaped Glasses” music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses. Evan was not only fully coherent and engaged during the three-day shoot but also heavily involved in weeks of pre-production planning and days of post-production editing of the final cut. The simulated sex scene took several hours to shoot with multiple takes using different angles and several long breaks in between camera setups. Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.
Rolling Stone interviewed one crew member from the video shoot under the condition of anonymity, who corroborated Wood’s claim. “I do believe that there were some moments of actual intercourse.”

Evan Rachel Wood conta que demorou a aceitar que foi abusada por Marilyn Manson,"Evan Rachel Wood conta que demorou a aceitar que foi abusada por Marilyn Manson
Atriz diz que está se abrindo sobre tudo o que sofreu enquanto estava num relacionamento com o cantor
Depois de muitos anos, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood está se abrindo sobre os abusos que sofreu enquanto estava num relacionamento com o cantor Marilyn Manson.
Numa participação no talk show de Drew Barrymore, Evan Rachel relatou como começou a perceber que algo estava errado.
""Literalmente no primeiro dia da tour. Depois do primeiro show, eu parei um pouco para observar o mundo. Eu era essa adolescente que idolatrava a indústria musical e sempre ouvi que turnês eram algo mágico, que eu estaria num ônibus para um mundo encantado. E na primeira noite me bateu forte de que aquilo não era o que eu imaginava, nem um pouco. Eu fiquei com medo no mesmo momento"", disse Wood.
Ela, que teve um relacionamento com o músico de 2007 a 2010, desabafou sobre o quanto negou o sentimento de que o que vivia não era bom. ""Chegou a um ponto onde eu já lidava com tanto abuso por parte da mídia e me coloquei em risco para ter um relacionamento com essa pessoa de uma forma tão controversa porque pensei que estava apaixonada. Eu vi tudo começar a ruir quando ele começou a me machucar"", desabafou a atriz.
""E quando eu percebi que não era o que eu tinha imaginado, eu estava muito em negação e com vergonha demais para admitir que talvez eu estivesse no caminho errado"", acrescentou.
Evan Rachel Wood, que está promovendo o documentário sobre o assunto 'Phoenix Rising', também revelou sobre o trauma de gravar o vídeo para a música ""Heart-Shaped Glass"", que simula uma relação sexual entre a atriz e Manson. ""Eu sabia que estava desconfortável e que algo terrível estava acontecendo, mas pensei: 'Se eu disser qualquer coisa sou eu quem estará com problemas. Vai me machucar, machucar minha carreira. Não posso contar a ninguém que isso aconteceu'.""
Segundo Wood, foi mais um episódio de negação em que ""abafou o sentimento [de dor]"". ""Para o vídeo, não houve nenhum contrato sobre a nudez que aconteceu. Normalmente, quando você faz uma cena de sexo explícito, tudo é conversado anteriormente sobre o que vai ser feito e o que será mostrado, o que você concorda em fazer e um acordo de que tudo será deletado depois"".
Ela explicou que em gravações com essa exposição há em norma a assinatura de um contrato. ""Isso não existiu [na ocasião do vídeo] porque não era esse o plano. E foi no momento que as câmeras começaram a gravar que minhas roupas foram tiradas"", recordou a atriz.
Wood falou sobre a tática que o músico usava com as outras mulheres com quem se relacionou: ""Ele pinta a pessoa com quem está como uma pessoa louca e abusiva. Ele fala para os amigos coisas que fazem você pensar que ele é quem está num relacionamento abusivo"".
Manson ""fez a mesma coisa com as meninas com quem ficou depois de mim"", emendou a atriz. ""Ele te pinta de louca para as outras porque, se algum dia você for até elas e tentar alertá-las sobre os comportamentos dele, elas já tem a ideia de que você é louca"".

Evan Rachel Wood racconta altri dettagli sugli abusi di Marilyn Manson nel documentario,"Evan Rachel Wood, ex moglie di Marilyn Manson nonché madre di suo figlio, da tempo ha denunciato pubblicamente gli abusi che avrebbe subito da parte dell'ex marito. Oltre a denunciarli pubblicamente in rete, raccontando sui suoi social network il trascorso avuto accanto allo shock rocker, l'attrice statunitense ha voluto far confluire l'intero suo racconto in un documentario. Si tratta di un film docu in due parti che si intitola Phoenix Rising, diretto dalla regista candidata all'Oscar Amy Berg (West of Memphis, Prophet’s Prey), prodotto da HBO e presentato al Sundance Festival. Nel documentario Evan Rachel Wood - famosa per la sua interpretazione di Dolores Abernathy nella serie televisiva Westworld - Dove tutto è concesso - ripercorre tutta la storia, tornando al momento dell'incontro con il musicista, che al secolo è Brian Warner. “Nel 2003 Wood ha recitato in Thirteen, un film in cui una teenager scopre sesso, droghe e crimine. Aveva 14 anni. Qualche anno dopo, quand’era maggiorenne, è andata a una festa allo Chateau Marmont di Los Angeles. È lì che Warner l’ha avvicinata per la prima volta. «Ha iniziato a parlare del film, diceva che era un fan e che apprezzava il mio lavoro», spiega Wood nel documentario. «Ha detto che stava lavorando a un progetto, Phantasmagoria, un film su Lewis Carroll e il suo subconscio»”, scrive Rolling Stone USA. “Secondo il documentario, Warner avrebbe usato il progetto mai realizzato di Phantasmagoria come scusa per passare del tempo con Wood (altre donne l’hanno accusato di averle attirate con la stessa tecnica). L’attrice sostiene che Warner le avrebbe chiesto di co-firmare la sceneggiatura. Una notte, a casa sua, ha cercato di trasformare la collaborazione in una relazione. «Ero una ragazzina in una stanza con un 37enne che beveva assenzio», racconta nel documentario. «Dovevo andarmene, ma lui mi ha messo il braccio sulle spalle e ha detto che gli sarei mancata. Non sono riuscita neanche a dire: “Mi mancherai anche tu” che mi aveva già baciato. Mi ha infilato la lingua in bocca. Onestamente, ero sotto shock. Avevo un fidanzato, lo sapeva pure lui. Lui era sposato. Io avevo 18 anni. Non sapevo come reagire. Ero spaventata ed eccitata allo stesso tempo»”, riporta l’edizione americana di Rolling Stone. Il film parla delle accuse contro Marilyn Manson e di come tutta l'esperienza da lei vissuta l'abbia stimolata a fondare un'organizzazione no profit (la Phoenix Act) finalizzata ad aiutare a sostenere le vittime di abusi domestici. Circa un anno fa, l'attrice aveva dichiarato: «Marilyn Manson ha iniziato ad approfittarsi di me quando ero adolescente e ha abusato di me in modo orribile per anni». Soltanto poco più di dodici mesi fa Evan Rachel Wood ha finalmente rivelato l'identità dell'uomo di cui parlava da anni, ossia l'uomo che avrebbe abusato di lei nel corso di una relazione. Wood non aveva mai rivelato il nome di chi si celava dietro a quello che lei dipingeva come un mostro. “Nel 2016 Wood si è fatta coraggio e ha raccontato di aver subito abusi, senza fare il nome di Marilyn Manson. È così che è stata invitata a parlare al Congresso in occasione dei lavori sul Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights, nel 2018. «Dopo la testimonianza, sono stata contattata da molte donne che erano state abusate dallo stesso uomo, avevano sentito la mia storia e sapevano esattamente di chi stavo parlando, visto che aveva fatto le stesse cose a loro», racconta. «C’erano anche cose online, quando le ho lette ho subito capito che non erano bugie, perché raccontavano la mia stessa storia, parola per parola. È stato come scoprire di aver frequentato un serial killer»”, riporta Rolling Stone USA. Poco più di un anno fa, Evan Rachel Wood ha fatto il nome di Marilyn Manson. Da quel momento in poi, tante altre donne hanno mosso le medesime accuse rivolte al cantante, e quattro di loro lo hanno denunciato. Dal canto suo, Brian Hugh Warner (vero nome del rocker) ha rigettato ogni accusa, denunciando Evan Rachel Wood per diffamazione.
Le accuse che Evan Rachel Wood muove all’ex marito vanno dallo stupro alla minaccia, dalla manipolazione all'imposizione di feticci di tipo nazista, oltre all’obbligo di sottoporsi a rituali di carni incise che fanno parte della cosiddetta scarificazione. “Wood racconta che il cantante l’ha convinta a incidersi una M sulla pelle (la cicatrice si vede nella seconda parte del documentario). «La scarificazione, marchiarsi erano parte della storia», dice lei nella prima parte. «Lui si è inciso una E, era un modo per dimostrare fedeltà e possesso. Io l’ho incisa vicino alla vagina per dimostrargli che gli appartenevo. Era gennaio 2007. Ora vorrei toglierla». Wood accenna anche al “vampirismo”. Succede nella scena in cui l’amica Ilma Gore parla di un patto di sangue con Warner. «Sì, bere sangue era decisamente nelle sue corde», dice Wood”, riporta Rolling Stone USA. Ciò che racconta l'attrice è un affresco molto drammatico e scioccante, quello che ha fatto da sfondo per anni alla sua relazione con Marilyn Manson, secondo quanto racconta lei. Nel documentario, che per adesso è uscito soltanto negli Stati Uniti (due giorni fa, il 15 marzo), Evan Rachel Wood racconta di essere stata minacciata dal musicista al fine di impedirle di parlare. “All’inizio del film, Wood dice di aver ricevuto messaggi anonimi minacciosi affinché non parlasse. Aggiunge che Warner le ha chiesto direttamente di non fare il suo nome. «Una volta ha detto che avrebbe distrutto la mia famiglia, a partire da mio padre. Io ho un figlio, è stato spaventoso. Fare il suo nome senza alcun supporto era un rischio troppo grande»”, riporta l'edizione americana di Rolling Stone. Il famoso magazine, considerato la “Bibbia del rock”, ha portato avanti un'inchiesta relativa alle accuse contro Brian Warner. Dalle testimonianze raccolte, pare che svariate donne abbiano dichiarato che all'inizio della propria relazione con Marilyn Manson, questi avrebbe fatto loro “love bombing”, subissandole di attenzioni e corteggiamenti.
Il primo stupro di cui Wood accusa Marilyn Manson
approfondimento
Evan Rachel Wood torna ad accusare Marilyn Manson: “Stupro sul set""
Rolling Stone USA scrive che “Manson l’ha «sostanzialmente stuprata» durante le riprese del video di Heart-Shaped Glasses. Wood aveva 19 anni quando ha partecipato al videoclip, una canzone in parte ispirata dalla pedofilia. Warner ha detto di averla scelta perché gli ricordava la locandina di Lolita. «Avremmo dovuto simulare una scena di sesso, ma quando le telecamere sono partite ha iniziato a penetrarmi per davvero», racconta Wood. «Non avevo mai accettato di farlo. Sono una professionista, faccio questo lavoro da una vita e non sono mai stata su un set così poco professionale. Era il caos più totale. Nessuno si prendeva cura di me. È stata un’esperienza traumatica. […] Ero disgustata, come se avessi fatto io qualcosa di cui vergognarmi. Anche la troupe era chiaramente a disagio, nessuno sapeva che fare. Ero stata ingannata e spinta a fare sesso con l’inganno. È quello il primo crimine commesso contro di me, sono stata stuprata in video»”.
L’avvocato di Brian Warner, Howard King, nega che quel rapporto sessuale sia avvenuto: «Brian non ha mai fatto sesso con Evan su quel set e anche lei lo sa», ha dichiarato il legale che difende Marilyn Manson.
Oltre a quel primo presunto stupro (diciamo presunto perché per adesso è doveroso il beneficio del dubbio, dato che la legge non si è ancora espressa in maniera inequivocabile), Wood nel documentario parla di quando l'ex avrebbe incominciato ad abusare di lei a livello fisico. È stato in tour. «Aveva dei problemi alla gola», racconta Evan Rachel Wood nel film. «Così un medico gli ha prescritto il Vicodin liquido, lui si è bevuto quasi un’intera bottiglia. Eravamo sul bus, dopo lo show, e non sapeva dove fosse. Mi faceva paura, era violento e tirava cose. Così ho pensato: ora entrerà la sicurezza e gestirà la situazione. E invece non è arrivato nessuno. […] Siamo andati in hotel, il bus era parcheggiato, Manson mi ha presa per il braccio e mi ha trascinata davanti a tutti. Mi ha tirata per il braccio fino a dentro l’hotel, nessuno ha mosso un dito. Siamo arrivati in camera e ha iniziato a urlare e sfasciare tutto. Io guardavo i membri della crew come per dire: non lasciatemi da sola, aiutatemi. Quando ha iniziato a chiudere la porta lentamente, ho pensato: no, no, no, non potete lasciarmi qui. C’era un tizio, pensavo fosse mio amico. Eravamo in tour insieme da mesi. Ha scosso la testa e chiuso la porta. È lì che ho capito che non ero al sicuro».
Il documentario parla anche di un altro tipo di violenze, ossia gli stupri notturni. “Wood dice che le droghe erano una costante della relazione con Warner. Nel documentario racconta che le metteva della metanfetamina tra i farmaci che doveva prendere. Le dava anche pillole per dormire. È così che, secondo Wood, ha iniziato a violentarla. «Se mi svegliavo avevo la prontezza di pensare: ok, fai finta di dormire, non ti muovere», racconta. «Restavo immobile finché non aveva finito. E poi, lo giuro su dio, mi spostava la gamba e usciva dalla stanza»”, riporta Rolling Stone USA.
A causa delle presunte violenze notturne subite dalla donna, si è instaurata una gravidanza indesiderata. Era il 2011 e l'attrice stava recitando nella serie televisiva Mildred Pierce quando ha scoperto di essere incinta. Di quel capitolo buio della sua vita, un difficile periodo in cui l'attrice dice di aver pensato al suicidio, così parla: «Sin dal principio della relazione, aveva problemi coi contraccettivi. Li ho provati tutti, ma non ce n’era mai uno che gli andasse bene. In buona sostanza, non voleva che li usassi. Si rifiutava anche di mettere il preservativo, pretendeva sesso a comando e se mi fossi rifiutata avrei avuto grossi problemi. E non hai modo di pensare a un contraccettivo quando qualcuno ti penetra mentre dormi, ma comunque cercavo di evitare una gravidanza. Usavo spermicidi e cose del genere, ma non hanno funzionato. Lui ha subito voluto che abortissi. Ero spaventata e triste. Ovviamente credo che una donna abbia il diritto di decidere, ma questo non significa che non sia stato devastante. Subito dopo [l’aborto], mi ha chiesto di cucinare la cena. Ricordo di aver pensato: ma io devo riposare… a lui non importava»..",2022-03-17T16:51:57Z,https://tg24.sky.it,Sky Tg24 
'Phoenix Rising' Director Responds to Marilyn Manson's Lawsuit,"Amy Berg, the director of HBO's documentary Phoenix Rising, has shared her response to Marilyn Manson's defamation lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood with Newsweek.
Wood has accused Manson of grooming her as a teen, and said in an Instagram post on February 1, 2021 that he ""horrifically abused [her] for years"" during their relationship.
The Westworld star spoke in greater detail about her alleged abuser in the documentary, including her claim that Manson raped her on camera while filming his music video ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"" in 2007.
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, has vehemently denied all allegations made against him and is suing Wood and activist Illma Gore for the accusations made in Phoenix Rising.
The musician's lawyer Howard King told Deadline on March 2 that Berg and HBO were not named in the lawsuit because they were ""also victims of Wood and Gore"" and claimed they were ""duped into making a documentary based on false claims and fraudulent documents.""
When asked for her response to these claims, Berg told Newsweek: ""There were a lot of lawyers that looked at every single second of this film, and every frame.
""So I don't know, like, what else we could do, our film is completely legally sound. And that's all I can really say about that.""
With regards to the defamation case itself, Berg added: ""I can't talk about the details of the lawsuit or the specific allegations that have been made, that's out of my realm. I'm sorry.""
In response to Berg's comments, a spokesperson for Manson told Newsweek: ""As documented in Brian's lawsuit, Evan Rachel Wood impersonated a federal agent by signing and submitting a fake FBI letter as evidence in court.
""The whole premise of the fake letter—suggesting that a federal agency was investigating Brian and that Wood and her family were in danger—created the plot of Part 2 of Phoenix Rising.
""If Wood was willing to deceive the court and HBO about that, what else is she willing to say or do? If HBO was willing to script a meeting between Wood and the FBI that never happened, what other portions of the purported documentary were similarly scripted to portray false impressions?""
Amy Berg on Working With Evan Rachel Wood
Berg told Newsweek she met Wood through mutual friends seven to 10 years prior to the release of the documentary, and it was because of conversations they had together that they decided to collaborate on the film.
""I came to work with her because she did approach me at the point when she had met with Gloria Allred, and she was told that the statute of limitations had expired on her case,"" Berg said. ""So she wanted to, she was going to change the law in California and she told me about that.
""I was really intrigued in her journey and what she was planning to do, and so we kind of loosely followed her around a bit through that first couple years, and then decided to make this into a formal documentary around the summer of 2020.
""Kind of around the time when Dan Cleary tweeted out that he stands with Evan Rachel Wood, that was when we kind of started really going at that point. That's when production picked up.""
Cleary spoke out in September 2020, sharing a Twitter thread in which he claimed Manson had ""turned [Wood] into a different person"" and ""broke her.""
Standing with the women who came forward to accuse Manson of abuse, Cleary also said: ""My sole focus is for people to not call these women liars. They're not.""
Thread: I worked directly with #MarilynManson in 2007-2008 for his touring band when #EvanRachelWood was with him. She was on tour with us the entire time. Over the course of 1 year he turned her into a different person. He broke her. I didnt totally realize until later in life. — Dan Cleary (@DanCleary79) September 13, 2020
The documentary also charts the work Wood put into establishing The Phoenix Act, which called to extend the statute of limitations for survivors of abuse in the state of California to 10 years.
Of working with her during this period, Berg said: ""She's very determined, she's very focused on the work and it was, you know, really encouraging to see that she could actually make these changes. And so [the fact] we were watching things happen in real time is really incredible.""
Berg went on to comment on how Wood felt safe discussing her experiences with her, with the director saying Wood ""was ready"" to talk openly about it even before she'd publicly named Manson as her alleged abuser.
""I think she felt safe with me, that was already established before we started filming,"" Berg said. ""You'd have to ask her, but I feel like we created a safe environment. But she was ready.
""So, she was just ready, she was ready to tell the story, and so it came out of her, and she was very clear and articulate about what she had experienced. And she had done a lot of work on herself, which, you know, shows.""
There is also a moment in the documentary, in October 2020, where Wood met with Cleary and a number of other survivors who claimed Manson had abused them and spoke about their alleged experiences.
Sharing how they ensured these men and women felt safe while reliving their trauma through the discussion, Berg explained: ""There was a therapist that was basically on call, a trauma therapist that was on call that day, and she introduced the group to her, and that was available to everybody as we went along.
""We we didn't do that Evan and Illma had provided that, we were documenting.""
Berg added that the creative team also worked with a group from Columbia University who help survivors, and said the resource was ""available to not just the survivors, but also the film team and anyone who might need that.""
How Evan Rachel Wood has Been 'Empowered' by Phoenix Rising
Since naming Manson publicly as her alleged abuser, and even before as is shown in the documentary, Wood has been subjected to victim-blaming and even death threats online.
Berg commented on this, saying she and Wood had discussed the way in which the public might react to her making the documentary.
""Evan and I spoke about this a lot in the beginning. I mean, it's hard for people to believe that somebody that they idolize could do something wrong,"" Berg said. ""And we've seen that historically, especially over the past 10 years, but probably more than that.
""And it's difficult because, you know, this is a person who represents certain things for his fans, but what is going on behind closed doors is not... this isn't an exaggeration, this has affected a lot of people in a very negative way. And the story needs to be told.""
Adding her own thoughts on how Wood has handled the situation since making her accusations public, Berg added: ""I would just imagine that she's relieved today, because [Phoenix Rising is] finally all out. I mean, this is a thing that she's been carrying around with her for many years.
""And so it's been really empowering to see her on The View or, you know, any of the talk shows, I haven't seen the Drew Barrymore show, I'm going to see it today. But, she's really empowered right now.
""She says she's not afraid, and she's bringing up new points in this discussion. Like, [on The View] she said they don't ask the perpetrator why he didn't leave if he was upset. I was like, those are things that we need to talk about. It's true.
""You know, it's like we're always blaming the victims. She warned me that there will be a lot of victim blaming [with] this story and I have seen it, you know, over the past two months, especially since the Sundance [Film Festival] cut aired.
""But it's a next level type of victim blaming, this story. And, you know, I've never really seen anything quite like it.""
When asked if she would consider working with Wood again to follow her in the aftermath of the documentary, Berg said: ""I mean, we told this story, and I think it's pretty complete at this point, so I'm interested to see what happens.
""I never would say never, but I feel like this film stands for itself and it speaks to what we wanted to say, it feels very complete to me.""
Phoenix Rising part 1 and 2 is available to stream on HBO Max now.

Evan Rachel Wood: l’orrore subito da Manson in un documentario,"Marilyn Manson: tutte le donne che lo accusano di violenze. E l’unica che lo difende
Continua la battaglia di Evan Rachel Wood, bellissima attrice americana, contro il suo ex fidanzato e presunto aguzzino Marilyn Manson, con cui è stata dal 2007 al 2010, quando aveva appena 18 anni.
Lo scorso anno Evan, insieme ad altre donne, aveva puntato il dito contro il cantante, responsabile, secondo le loro testimonianze, di abusi e violenze. Oggi, l’attrice racconta minuziosamente, nel dettaglio, tali violenze fisiche e psicologiche subite, in un documentario in due parti di Amy Berg, “Phoenix Rising“, presentato in anteprima su HBO.
Evan Rachel Wood: gli abusi raccontati in “”Phoenix Rising“
Oltre a raccontare come l’abbia ripetutamente drogata e violentata mentre la isolava sempre più dalla sua famiglia e dai suoi amici, Wood – che aveva solo 18 anni quando iniziò a frequentare Manson, allora 37enne – rivela le violenze che le ha inflitto quando ha cercato di lasciarlo.
Evan spiega come Manson l’abbia legata a una panca, fatta inginocchiare, frustata con una frusta nazista dall’Olocausto e colpito i suoi genitali con l’elettricità, con un sex toy BDSM, finché non lo ha implorato perdono per farlo smettere. A quel punto, l’ha costretta a bere il suo sangue, mentre lui faceva altrettanto.
Evan Rachel Wood: Manson esploso quando volevo lasciarlo
L’attrice racconta davanti alle telecamere: “Ci eravamo lasciati e lui mi chiamava e mi chiamava e mi chiamava e io stavo cercando di ‘disinnescarlo'”. Ricorda di essere andata a casa sua, Manson l’ha portata nella sua camera da letto, dove ha visto una panca inginocchiata, come quella usata per pregare in chiesa, sistemata al centro della stanza. “E io sapevo. Sapevo solo cosa sarebbe successo”, dice. “Dopo che mi ha legato, mi ha colpito ancora e ancora e ancora con una frusta. Che era una frusta nazista dell’Olocausto, con sopra una svastica. Perché io sono ebrea. Ha poi detto che mi avrebbe colpito nello stesso posto più e più volte in modo che mi avrebbe fatto davvero male. E poi mi ha scioccato con una bacchetta sui lividi che già avevo”. Ha colpito le mie parti intime con l’elettricità, con un sex toy BDSM, e mi ha fatto così male che ho rotto l’inginocchiatoio a metà”.
“Ricordo di aver pensato in quel momento, digli solo quello che vuole sentire. Digli solo quello che vuole sentire, e io ho detto: ‘Mi dispiace tanto, mi dispiace così tanto’, gli chiedevo perdono, e lui mi cullava e diceva: ‘Hai capito ora’.”. A quel punto ha tagliato la pelle della sua mano e le ha fatto bere il suo sangue, prima di tagliarla anche lei e bere il suo sangue.
“La violenza non era nuova, e nemmeno il suo fascino per i nazisti“.
Marilyn Manson: il fascino per il nazismo e Hitler
Quando vivevano insieme, Evan racconta dice che Manson aveva rimepito la loro casa di propaganda nazista. “A un certo punto scrisse: ‘Uccidi tutti gli ebrei’ sul muro della nostra camera da letto”, dice.
Le disse anche che Hitler era “la prima rock star perché era elegante, parlava bene e sapeva come manipolare le masse”.
Manson la prendeva in giro perché era ebrea, e anche quando lei si arrabbiava per il suo antisemitismo.
Non a caso l’attrice ha anche rivelato che nel corso della loro relazione, Manson si è tatuato una svastica sul petto e un teschio e ossa sul braccio che sembra un Totenkopf, altro simbolo nazista.
Evan Rachel Wood: la violenza sessuale nel video
Evan torna anche a parlare della violenza sessuale subita mentre giravano insieme il video Heart-Shaped Glasses. “Avevamo discusso di una scena di sesso simulato, ma una volta che le telecamere sono state accese, ha iniziato a penetrarmi davvero. Non avevo mai acconsentito”, dice.
“È stata un’esperienza davvero traumatizzante girare il video. Non sapevo come difendere me stessa o come dire di no perché ero stata condizionata e “addestrata” a non rispondere mai, a resistere.
“Mi sentivo disgustata da me stessa, come se avessi fatto qualcosa di vergognoso, e potevo dire che tutta l’equipe era molto a disagio e nessuno sapeva cosa fare. Sono stato costretto a compiere un atto sessuale commerciale con false premesse.

Speaking on ‘The Drew Barrymore Show’, she said: “That was the catalyst, like really. “It was like, ‘How do I live with myself knowing I am the example for this young person if I can’t speak up for myself and for other people.’ “Especially in a time such as this that we are living in, when these things are getting pushed to the surface and now is the time for truth and healing and having those hard conversations and if I run away from this now what do I tell my child.

Evan Rachel Wood: Η κακοποίηση που υπέστη από τον Marilyn Manson,"Evan Rachel Wood: Η σχέση τους ξεκίνησε το 2007, όταν ήταν 18 και εκείνος 38 χρονών, ενώ αρραβωνιάστηκαν το 2010 λίγο πριν χωρίσουν οριστικά.
Η Evan Rachel Wood εξιστορεί τη σεξουαλική κακοποίηση που υπέστη από τον Marilyn Manson, κάτι το οποίο θα δούμε στο νέο ντοκιμαντέρ του HBO. Η 34χρονη ηθοποιός που πλέον νιώθει λύτρωση που έχει καταγγείλει δημοσίως τον διάσημο μουσικό για κακοποίηση, προχώρησε πρόσφατα σε μια συγκλονιστική εξομολόγηση στο The Cut με αφορμή το ντοκιμαντέρ, του οποίου το δεύτερο μέρος με τίτλο “Phoenix Rising: Stand Up” προβλήθηκε χθες 16 Μαρτίου. Το ντοκιμαντέρ έχει ως στόχο να μην επιτρέψει και σε άλλες γυναίκες να βιώσουν κάτι αντίστοιχο, στηρίζοντας με όλο της το πάθος τα θύματα κάθε είδους κακοποίησης.
Μέσα από τη δική της δύναμη, έκανε άλλες 16 γυναίκες να μιλήσουν ανοιχτά για σωματική και συναισθηματική κακοποίηση που δέχτηκαν από τον Manson. Οι τέσσερις από αυτές τον έχουν κατηγορήσει για σεξουαλική βία παρόλο που εκείνος το αρνείται. Η σχέση των Rachel και Manson ξεκίνησε το 2007, όταν εκείνη ήταν 18 και ο εκείνος 38 χρονών, ενώ αρραβωνιάστηκαν το 2010 λίγο πριν χωρίσουν οριστικά. H κακοποίησή της έγινε γνωστή μέσα από μια αποκαλυπτική ανάρτησή της στο Instagram τον Φεβρουάριο του 2021.
«Θα μπορούσα να είχα αυτοκτονήσει και όλη αυτή η ιστορία να μην δημοσιευόταν ποτέ»
Η ίδια δεν μπορεί να ξεχάσει την πλύση εγκεφάλου, τα αντίποινα και τους εκβιασμούς που της έκανε, ενώ πλέον νιώθει ελεύθερη που κατάφερε να σταθεί και πάλι στα πόδια της, αποκαλύπτοντας δημόσια το όνομά του. Να αναφέρουμε πως η πρώτη φορά που ο Manson βίασε τη Rachel ήταν στα γυρίσματα του “Heart-Shaped Glasses”, παρόλο που η σκηνή προοριζόταν να είναι προσποιητή. Στο Phoenix Rising, η ηθοποιός λέει πως παρόλο που της έκαναν slut- shaming στα media, o Manson έπαιζε με τον Τύπο, κάνοντας υπεκφυγές για το αν το σεξ ήταν αληθινό ή όχι. «Θα μπορούσα να είχα αυτοκτονήσει και όλη αυτή η ιστορία να μην δημοσιευόταν ποτέ», είπε η ίδια αλλά δεν το έκανε ποτέ, παραδειγματίζοντας σήμερα τόσες άλλες κοπέλες που βίωσαν -ή και βιώνουν- κάτι αντίστοιχο.

‘I have truth on my side’ - Evan Rachel Wood addresses Marilyn Manson’s defamation lawsuit,"Evan Rachel Wood has responded to Marilyn Manson’s defamation lawsuit after she accused him of sexually assaulting her.
Appearing on Good Morning America to discuss her new documentary Phoenix Rising, Wood affirmed that she would be standing by her allegations.
When the laws don’t protect you, change them. #PhoenixRising follows Evan Rachel Wood’s tale of survival and activism. The two part documentary, produced and directed by Amy Berg (@disarmingfilms), premieres March 15 on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/U2YfRGd76t — HBO Documentaries (@HBODocs) February 22, 2022
The Westworld actor told the hosts she stands by “everything that I have said about the abuse allegations”.
Asked directly whether the claims in Manson’s lawsuit were false, Wood replied: “I don’t believe I am legally allowed to comment on any of the allegations, but I am very confident that I have the truth on my side.”
Wood has alleged that the rock star raped her on the set of his music video for “Heart Shaped Glasses”.
At least 15 other women have also accused Manson of sexual assault including Game of Thrones actor Esme Bianco.
In Manson’s lawsuit accusing Wood of defamation, he has accused her of “conspiring” against him for monetary gain.
Wood and Manson – real name Brian Warner – began dating in 2006 when she was still a teenager. They were later engaged but broke up in 2010.
In Phoenix Rising, Wood also accuses Manson of forcing her to drink his blood and cutting and beating her. Manson has denied all accusations from Wood and the other women.
The Independent has contacted representatives of Manson for comment. Howard King, attorney for Brian Warner, responded: “As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted. This is just more of the same. But, then again, what else would you expect from a group who have spread falsehood after falsehood about Brian and even went as far as to forge an FBI letter to further their phony claims?”
‘Phoenix Rising’ airs on Sky Documentaries on 17 and 18 March at 9pm",2022-03-17T00:00:00Z,https://www.independent.ie,Independent.ie
"Evan Rachel Wood, in Documentary on Marilyn Manson, Reveals Torture Allegations","Wood said that after she apologized to him repeatedly, Manson cut his hand and made her drink his blood, and then cut her and drank her blood. She described how a feeling of disassociation and subsequent trauma changed her life. “The world is just never the same,” she said. “It’s never the same because everything that happens to you after that point is through the veil of this memory. You know it’s out there. You know that’s in the world. You know that people are capable of doing something like this.”
She alleged that during the filming of the 2011 HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce, she learned that she was pregnant. “From the beginning of our relationship, he always had an issue with whatever birth control I was using,” Wood said. “I went through like every type to see which one he liked, and he didn’t like any of them. So essentially, he didn’t want me using birth control. He refused to wear a condom ever, and it was very much sex-on-demand and it was going to cause more problems if I said no. You don’t have time to use birth control when somebody’s just penetrating you while you’re asleep or if they’ve given you a pill that made you black out.”
In the episode, Wood also discusses suicidal ideation and self-harm. Phoenix Rising concludes with the moment when Wood publicly named Manson as her alleged abuser for the first time in 2021.
Manson has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual assault. Before the televised premiere of Phoenix Rising, Manson sued Wood and Illma Gore for defamation. Wood responded to the lawsuit in a TV appearance this week. Pitchfork has reached out to Manson’s representatives and attorneys.

Marilyn Manson’s ex-assistant claims she was threatened with legal actions,"Marilyn Manson’s ex-assistant claims she was threatened with legal actions
Marilyn Manson’s former assistant, Ashley Walters has claimed in a new complaint that she was threatened with legal actions to stop her from participating in Evan Rachel Wood’s new documentary Phoenix Rising.
Walter took the matter to court on Friday after Los Angeles court asked her team to come up with an amended complaint by March 11 over timeline of allegation with respect to two year statute of limitations.
“On January 7, 2022, Defendants sent Plaintiff an email through her counsel, threatening to take retaliatory legal action against her if she 'participate[ed] in any interviews about Mr. Warner or reveal[ed] any confidential information' about him,"" Walter’s amended complaint read.
Wood was slammed with a lawsuit by Manson on March 2 – just ahead of the released of her documentary, over ""a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV, and film career.""
The Sweet Dreams singer’s assistant initially dragged Manson into the court between 2010 to 2011 over alleged sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress in May 2021, as per court documents.",2022-03-16T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
"In 'Phoenix Rising' on HBO, a documentary about Evan Rachel Wood's relationship with Marilyn Manson, survivors are heard.","The act of telling someone about domestic abuse is terrifying. It can lead to healing or it can lead to further harm — in many cases, both. In “Phoenix Rising,” a new HBO documentary about actor Evan Rachel Wood’s struggle to name her alleged abuser and reclaim her story, we see how telling completely upends her life. She is excoriated by the public on social media. She must travel to a safe house with her child. And still, at the end of the documentary, she names Marilyn Manson, aka Brian Warner, as the man she accuses of having brutalized her for years.
(Manson maintains he is innocent. He claims that his ""intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth."")

We know what happens to women who name their abusers, especially if they are powerful and beloved figures. They are often called liars and accused of wanting money, fame and revenge. In the case of Wood: “What did she expect? Look at him” — a reference to Manson’s purposefully shocking performance persona. The vitriol Wood receives on social media shows there still are those who think victim shaming and disbelieving women’s accounts of violence are ways to cope with the tarnishing of their idols — or their own abusive behavior.
“Phoenix Rising” aims to educate its audience about how abusers succeed in luring in their victims, as well as the particular circumstances that led Wood, who was 18 years old at the time, according to the documentary, to enter a relationship with the then-37-year-old goth rocker.
Wood candidly alleges that Manson love bombed her, a manipulation tactic in which abusers use excessive affection or attention to influence or control their partners. He is also alleged to have eroded her boundaries and isolated her from her family and friends. She presents intimate photographs of and diary entries about early moments in the relationship that show a young woman in awe of a charismatic provocateur: “When you feel invisible and you think somebody sees you, it’s very alluring,” Wood explains in the documentary. “I felt like ‘here’s someone who gets me.’” These archives illustrate Wood’s impressionability and also Manson’s attractiveness in the beginning of their relationship.
The documentary also suggests that Wood may have been susceptible to grooming by Manson because her experiences as a young Hollywood actor were confusing. Often cast as a “Lolita”-type ingenue after her success in the movie “Thirteen” (2003), Wood intimates that she felt rudderless, without a sense of self. And, like other young actors and musicians in the early 2000s, she had to deal with a venomous gossip industry. The documentary reminds us that celebrity blogger Perez Hilton’s nickname for Wood was “Evan Rachel Whore.”
When Wood alleges that Manson raped her during the music video for the song “Heart-Shaped Glasses,” we see how the industry profoundly failed to help a young woman in danger. Distressed, Wood says the rape is what viewers see every time they watch that video. “I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses,” she says. “We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real.”
Her family life was fractured at the time, and with few professional safeguards seemingly in place, Wood and Manson’s relationship progressed. Over time, Wood claims, Manson deprived her of sleep, threatened her and her loved ones and drugged her and assaulted her. Manson has denied these allegations and is suing Wood claiming fraud, defamation and conspiracy, to which Wood responded: “I’m not scared.”
Wood says that by the time she escaped the relationship several years later, she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and desperately trying to find a way to make sense of what happened. She turned to activism.
Wood’s 2018 testimony before a House Judiciary subcommittee in behalf of the Sexual Assault Survivors Bill of Rights went viral; for many it was the first time they had heard about her accusations. In 2019, Wood also appeared in front of the California Senate to testify in behalf of a bill she proposed, the Phoenix Act.
In fact, the documentary’s name refers to the Phoenix Act, which passed in California in January 2020. The act extends the time domestic abuse survivors have to press charges against their abusers, which had limited Wood’s ability to take legal action against Manson. During her testimony, Wood said she was inspired to push the Phoenix Act after she realized she wasn’t alone. As the documentary details, at least 15 women claim Manson abused them. (Manson has denied all of their allegations, describing them as ""horrible distortions of reality."") Wood says that when she heard from these women, “it was like finding out you dated a serial killer.” Some of the most powerful moments in the documentary include support sessions between Wood and Manson’s other accusers.
At the end of the documentary, the filmmakers say they reached out to Manson and his legal representatives about the film’s contents but didn’t receive any comment. They also display a previously released statement by his counsel:
""Mr. Warner vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone. These lurid claims against my client have three things in common — they are all false, alleged to have taken place more than a decade ago and part of a coordinated attack by former partners and associates of Mr. Warner.""
To see these women share their accusations of abuse — finally being heard, their faces a mosaic of emotion — is difficult but necessary. They emphasize how important being heard is and that telling their story is a fundamental act of healing.
Survivors of abuse often find it difficult to speak out, but once they do, they can be burdened with an impulse to tell, tell, tell. I should know — I’m also a survivor. I was scared to disclose what had happened to me, but once I did, I couldn’t stop. Partly that’s because we think that if we share the story enough, maybe someone will believe us. Maybe someone will see the signs. Maybe we can help, save, teach. Wood says as much: “There are other victims and potentially future victims. I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. I want this to stop.”

Marilyn Manson's former assistant Ashley Walters alleged that she was threatened with legal action if she were to participate in Evan Rachel Wood's documentary ""Phoenix Rising,"" which is centered around Wood's allegations of sexual assault against Manson, according to a new lawsuit filed by Walters on Friday.
Walters submitted a new complaint after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael L. Stern had asked her team to file an amended complaint by March 11 after calling into question the timeline of her allegations in relation to the two year statute of limitations.
""On January 7, 2022, Defendants sent Plaintiff an email through her counsel, threatening to take retaliatory legal action against her if she 'participate[ed] in any interviews about Mr. Warner or reveal[ed] any confidential information' about him,"" Walters' attorneys wrote in the complaint, referring to Manson by his birth name Brian Warner, mentioning that Wood was sued for sharing her allegations in her documentary.
On March 2, ahead of the release of Wood's documentary, Manson sued Wood for defamation, calling her allegations ""a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV, and film career.""
Walters, Manson's assistant between 2010 to 2011, initially sued the artist over alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress in May 2021, according to court documents.
Manson's team has challenged Walters' lawsuit, denying all of the allegations and claiming that they are past the statute of limitations.
In the lawsuit, Walters alleged that Manson forced her to work for two days straight, during which she says she feared Manson's frequent violent and angry outbursts.
Walters accused Manson of pushing her onto his ""influential industry friends and associates,"" including an actor, who forcefully kissed her, in September 2010. She also alleged that Manson harassed her by forcefully kissing her.
Though the allegations remain the same in Walters' amended suit, her team added to its reasoning as to the timing of the lawsuit's submission.
""Plaintiff was unable to recall many of the physical and emotional abuses until the fall of 2020 when countless repressed memories flooded back to Plaintiff after meeting numerous other victims of Defendants and obtaining counseling from a mental health professional,"" the amended complaint said.
Similarly, with the first complaint, Walters reiterates that through meeting with Wood, Esme Bianco, and Ashley Morgan Smithline, all of whom have sued Manson over alleged sexual abuse, she was able to process the weight of what Manson allegedly did to her.
At a January hearing, Walters' team initially offered supporting arguments for the delayed timeline, alleging that Manson had threatened Walters about speaking out in 2019.
""It took Plaintiff years, speaking with others in the support group, and attending therapy, to understand the extent and wrongfulness of, and recall all of the abuse that Warner subjected her to. She continues to unlock suppressed memories to this day,"" the amended lawsuit said.

'Phoenix Rising' on HBO: What Is The Phoenix Act And When Was the Bill Passed?,"Evan Rachel Wood has spoken out against Marilyn Manson in a new documentary titled Phoenix Rising, where she details her allegations that he groomed her as a teenager and was abusive in their relationship.
The HBO docuseries is split into two parts and will air on the channel over two nights on Tuesday, March 15 and Wednesday, March 16.
It sees Wood and her family speak on her relationship with Manson (whose real name is Brian Warner), as well as other women who also claim the musician was abusive towards them.
Warner has denied all allegations made against him, and began a defamation lawsuit against Wood earlier this year.
Phoenix Rising also charts the part Wood played in creating and getting The Phoenix Act passed into law.
Newsweek has everything you need to know about the bill.
What Is The Phoenix Act?
The Phoenix Act was created by a non-profit organization created by Wood and a team of survivors to help stop the cycle of domestic violence.
The Phoenix Act aims to change legislation across the country and the survivor-led organization have previously described their mission as helping guide state legislators so the law ""effectively addresses the needs of that state's survivor community.""
In April 2019, Wood testified in front of the California State Senate to propose her bill, also titled The Phoenix Act.
The bill petitioned for the statute of limitations for sexual assault survivors to be extended from two to four years to 10 years when there is undeniable evidence the abuse occurred, or if there are three or more people accusing a single perpetrator.
Wood's proposed bill took into account the length of time it takes for survivors of sexual and domestic abuse to process their trauma, and also how long it may take a survivor to decide they want to take legal action against their alleged abuser without fear of retaliation.
In her 2019 testimony, Wood said the statue of limitations needed to be extended because ""the fear of being judged by society is debilitating, and the fear of retaliation from my abuser is paralyzing.""
She added that she wanted to help ""create a cushion [for victims] to leave their dangerous situations, get the help they need, and come back from their trauma in order to pursue justice and stop serial abusers"" through the Phoenix Act.
California Senator Susan Rubio sponsored the Phoenix Act and she sat with Wood when she gave her testimony.
When Was the Phoenix Act Passed Into Law?
The Phoenix Act was passed unanimously in the state of California and it was passed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on January 1, 2020.
While the Phoenix Act was passed into law, the statue of limitations was extended to five years, rather than Wood's initial proposition of 10 years.
The law also improves training requirements for police officers so they are better able to identify victims of domestic violence without causing them more harm.

In an interview with People, Wood said of the law after it was passed: ""My goal in doing this was to make sure that what happened to me couldn't happen to anybody else, if they were in my situation.
""And to start a dialogue that we so desperately need, because it's a global epidemic, and it affects men and women and children.
""Bad things can happen to you, but you can rise out of the ashes. That is exactly why I named it the Phoenix Act. I do believe that you can come back from tragedy, sometimes even stronger than you were before.""

What Marilyn Manson Said About Evan Rachel Wood's Accusations of Abuse on 'Phoenix Rising',"In her HBO documentary Phoenix Rising, Evan Rachel Wood has accused Marilyn Manson of abuse, claiming he groomed her as a teen and subjected her to domestic abuse during their relationship.
Wood first publicly named Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, as her alleged abuser in a post on Instagram on February 1, 2021, in which she claimed Manson had ""horrifically abused [her] for years"" and said she was ""brainwashed and manipulated"" by him.
On the same day that Wood named Manson publicly, four other women also came forward and accused the musician of sexual and physical violence, as well as mental, physical and emotional abuse.
According to Rolling Stone, at least 16 women have now come forward to make allegations against Manson.
Phoenix Rising sees Wood share details of this alleged abuse, which include her claiming that Manson had raped her on camera while they filmed the music video for his song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"" in 2007.
Manson has vehemently denied all allegations made against him and has launched a defamation lawsuit against Wood over the documentary.
What Marilyn Manson Said About Evan Rachel Wood's Accusations of Abuse on 'Phoenix Rising'
Wood and Manson first met when she was 18 and he was 37, and their relationship became public in 2007. They became engaged in 2010, but broke up shortly thereafter.
In 2018, Wood first spoke about the abuse she experienced when testifying in front of U.S. Congress during a hearing of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime with fellow activists, though she did not name Warner at the time.
She then testified in April 2019 in front of the California Senate Public Safety Committee to pass The Phoenix Act, a bill which called for the statue of limitations for sexual assault survivors to be extended from two to four years to 10 years.
On February 2, 2021, a day after Wood publicly named him as her alleged abuser, Manson shared a statement on social media in which he said: ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how—and why—others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
Manson's legal representatives have also released a statement, which is shown in Phoenix Rising, that says: ""Mr. Warner vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone. These lurid claims against my client have three things in common—they are all false, alleged to have taken place more than a decade ago, and part of a coordinated attack by former partners and associates of Mr. Warner who have weaponized the otherwise mundane details of his personal life and their consensual relationships into fabricated horror stories.""
In Phoenix Rising, Wood claimed that while filming the music video for ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"" she was given absinthe and drugs, and Manson ""started penetrating [her] for real"" whilst filming a scene that was meant to be ""simulated.""
Wood explained: ""It's nothing like I thought it was going to be. We're doing things that were not what was pitched to me. We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that.""
In an interview with The Independent on January 26, 2022, Manson's attorney Howard King said: ""Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the 'Heart-Shaped Glasses' music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses.
""Evan was not only fully coherent and engaged during the three-day shoot but also heavily involved in weeks of pre-production planning and days of post-production editing of the final cut.
""The simulated sex scene took several hours to shoot with multiple takes using different angles and several long breaks in between camera setups. Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.""

On Wednesday, March 3, Manson's legal team announced that a defamation lawsuit had been filed against Wood and ""her on-again, off-again romantic partner"" Ashley ""Illma"" Gore in the Los Angeles Superior Court.
Manson's attorney King told Newsweek at the time: ""This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner. Years after the end of Evan Rachel Wood's long-term relationship with Warner, she and her girlfriend Illma Gore recruited numerous women and convinced them to make false allegations against him—claims that Wood and Gore scripted for them.""
According to a complaint obtained by Newsweek on March 2, attorneys for Manson wrote that his portrayal as a ""rapist and abuser"" was ""a malicious falsehood that has derailed [his] successful music, TV, and film career.""
The lawsuit also alleges Wood and Gore ""secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner."" It also accused the pair of circulating a letter impersonating an FBI agent that falsely claimed a federal investigation was underway.
Wood appeared on The View on March 14 to speak about her allegations against Manson, and she also spoke about his lawsuit and claimed she was ""not scared.""
She said: ""I can't obviously speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I'm not scared. I am sad, because this is how it works.
""This is what pretty much every survivor that tries to expose someone in a position of power goes though, and this is part of the retaliation that keeps survivors quiet. This is why people don't want to come forward. This was expected.""
She added: ""I am very confident that I have the truth on my side and that the truth will come out. This is clearly timed before the documentary... I'm not doing this to clear my name. I'm doing this to protect people.
""I'm doing this to sound the alarm that there is a dangerous person out there and I don't want anybody getting near him. So people can think whatever they want about me. I have to let the legal process run its course, and I'm steady as a rock.""
In response to Wood's appearance on The View, Warner's attorney King told Newsweek: ""As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted. This is just more of the same. But, then again, what else would you expect from a group who have spread falsehood after falsehood about Brian and even went as far as to forge an FBI letter to further their phony claims?""
Newsweek has approached Wood's representatives for further comment.
Phoenix Rising airs in two parts on HBO on Tuesday, March 15 and Wednesday, March 16.

Evan Rachel Wood responds to Marilyn Manson's defamation suit,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)
Evan Rachel Wood is not backing down on her abuse claims against ex Marilyn Manson despite being sued for defamation.
The actress, 34, appeared on “Good Morning America” Monday and said she stands by “everything that I have said about the abuse allegations.”
When asked whether the claims made against her in Manson’s suit were false, she replied, “I don’t believe I am legally allowed to comment on any of the allegations, but I am very confident that I have the truth on my side.”
The “Thirteen” star also made an appearance on “The View” Monday and reiterated her accusations that she had been “groomed” by the rocker, 53, at a very early age so that he could “manipulate” her.
She alleged Manson raped her on the set of his 2007 music video “Heart Shaped Glasses,” which both the singer and his lawyer denied.
“We would have to sit here for six hours for me to go through everything, honestly. But ultimately, yes, the acts of violence that he committed against me and a number of other victims — men and women — are absolutely horrific,” Wood said on “The View.”
“But the most insidious thing that he did, and that people like him do, is that they completely fracture your sense of self. He made me forget who I was.”
Manson alleged in his lawsuit that Wood and artist Illma Gore gave “co-conspirators” scripts to ensure all “talking points” got into their interviews. E. Charbonneau
Wood also highlighted Manson’s other alleged sexual assault victims, claiming the “Beautiful People” performer has a “pattern to his abuse.”
At least 15 women — including actress Esmé Bianco — have accused Manson of various levels of sexual, psychological and physical abuse. He has denied all the allegations through his attorneys.
When Wood was again questioned about Manson’s lawsuit against her on “The View,” the “Westworld” actress responded, “I can’t obviously speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I am not scared, I am sad,” adding that this is “part of the retaliation that keeps survivors quiet, this is expected.”
In response to Wood’s TV appearances and her documentary, “Phoenix Rising,” Manson’s attorney, Howard King, told Page Six Tuesday, “As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their handpicked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted.
“This is just more of the same. But, then again, what else would you expect from a group who have spread falsehood after falsehood about Brian [Warner, Manson’s real name]?”
In the lawsuit, filed on March 2, Manson accused Wood and her on-again, off-again girlfriend, Gore, of “conspiring” to defame him for their own monetary gain.
Wood first dropped the bombshell claim that Manson was her abuser in February 2021, stating he had allegedly “started grooming” her when she was a teenager and “horrifically abused” her for years.
The former couple dated from 2006 to 2010 and were briefly engaged.
Wood talked about the alleged abuse in more depth in her new HBO documentary, “Phoenix Rising.” In the two-part special, she alleges Manson had forced her to drink his blood and raped, cut and beat her without consent.
Wood also shared on “GMA” that she was “severely punished” one time when she went to Manson’s home to try to “defuse the situation” after he allegedly threatened suicide.
Manson’s attorneys alleged in the complaint that Wood and Gore, 30, have used their film project to “recruit, coordinate and pressure women who had been linked to Warner to make false accusations of abuse against him.”
In a previous statement to Page Six, Manson’s lawyer, King, also accused Wood and Gore of using an allegedly “fabricated FBI letter” to “convince others to join their crusade” and “dupe HBO into distributing a one-sided ‘documentary’ premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation.
“Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts,” the attorney said. “But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable — and this legal action will hold them to account.”
Manson’s legal team reaffirmed to Page Six Tuesday, “As we have stated from the beginning, Mr. Warner vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone.”",2022-03-15T16:03:12Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
'Phoenix Rising' follows Evan Rachel Wood on her journey from acting to activism,"(CNN) Evan Rachel Wood delves deeply into allegations of domestic abuse against former boyfriend Marilyn Manson in ""Phoenix Rising,"" a detailed chronicle of the ""Westworld"" star's evolution from acting to activism. Yet an equally sobering aspect of this two-part HBO documentary involves Wood's upbringing in Hollywood, and her memories of being sexualized in movies at an early age.
The headline-grabbing foundation involves Wood's fight for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in conjunction with a coalition of other survivors, which successfully lobbied to extend the statute of limitations on such cases in California.
At length, Wood describes meeting Manson, a.k.a. Brian Warner, when she was 18 (he was 37), the beginnings of their romance and disturbing allegations about how she was abused, including a music video in which their interactions prompted concern among members of the crew. Manson declined an interview, but his legal counsel provided a detailed statement to the filmmakers saying that he ""vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone,"" and that former partners had ""weaponized"" consensual relationships into ""fabricated horror stories.""
Directed by Amy Berg (""The Case against Adnan Syed""), much of the documentary is devoted to Wood finding her voice to speak out, acknowledging her apprehensions about doing so. She was ""terrified"" to name Manson publicly, she says, adding that doing so risks ""retraumatizing yourself"" and ""putting a target on your back."" In the second half, she meets with other alleged survivors of purported abuse by Manson, a segment that drags on a bit too long.
""Phoenix Rising"" proves most compelling during the first part, which includes a step-by-step breakdown of common patterns that domestic abusers follow to control and intimidate victims. That chapter incorporates Wood's family issues and history, moving to Hollywood after her parents separated and becoming a child star, appearing in the extremely edgy ""Thirteen,"" a stark independent film about troubled teens.

Phoenix Rising: Where to watch in Australia,"Evan with Marilyn Manson. Getty
What are the allegations?
Evan first went public with her allegations in February of 2021.
Although she had alluded to being in an abusive relationship in the past, she had never named the alleged perpetrator. She took to Instagram, sharing text straight to her grid to reveal his identity.
“The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,” she began.
“He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” she alleged.
“I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.
“I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.
“I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silenced.”
""I'm doing this to protect people."" Binge
Manson has since filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood, and continues to strenuously deny her allegations.
Evan has responded publicly to the defamation suit.
“I can’t obviously speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I am not scared,” she said on the morning talk show The View.
She admitted to the hosts that in the face of the lawsuit, she still feels “very confident that I have the truth on my side and that the truth will come out.”
""I’m doing this to protect people. I’m doing this to sound the alarm that there is a dangerous person out there and I don’t want anybody getting near him,"" she continued.
""So, people can think whatever they want about me. I have to let the legal process run its course, and I’m steady as a rock.""

What is the Phoenix Act?
Working with a team of similarly affected women, Evan co-authored and lobbied passage of The Phoenix Act, which she first proposed in April 2019.
The Phoenix Act requested that the statute of limitations be extended from four years to 10 years in California when there is undeniable evidence of abuse, or if there are three or more people accusing a single perpetrator.
Evan said publicly in court that she wanted to help “create a cushion [for victims] to leave their dangerous situations, get the help they need, and come back from their trauma in order to pursue justice and stop serial abusers”.
The Act was passed into law in January 2020 extending the statute of limitations to five years.

Evan Rachel Wood,"Evan Rachel Wood appeared on The Daily Show on Monday night (March 14) to talk about the 16-year journey she took to confronting her alleged abuser and the reason she hopes her new two-part documentary, Phoenix Rising, could help other people who feel trapped in a cycle of abuse come forward and speak their truth.
“I don’t believe that he will stop until he is stopped,” she said of Marilyn Manson, her former fiancé, who she claims in the film methodically groomed her when she 18 and isolated her before allegedly subjecting the Westworld star to ritualistic abuse. “And sometimes the greatest act of love is stopping that person from hurting themselves or hurting anybody else.”
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
The nearly three-hour mini-series, directed and produced by acclaimed Oscar-nominated filmmaker Amy Berg (best known for her Catholic church sex abuse film Deliver Us From Evil and the sex abuse in Hollywood doc An Open Secret), premieres on HBO Max tonight (March 15). The first part chronicles Wood’s rise in Hollywood as a 13-year-old star-in-the-making and her chance meeting with Manson (born Brian Warner) at a party when she was 18. In the film she describes how that evening turned into a years-long relationship and engagement with the decades-older rocker that she claims included vicious sexual, physical and emotional abuse, including alleged anti-Semitic taunts and threats against the actress, who is Jewish; Manson has repeatedly denied the allegations and earlier this month sued Wood for defamation over the accusations, which the suit claimed is part of an “organized attack.”
Wood explained why she thinks it took 16 years for her to open up about her alleged abuse at the hands of Manson, who has also been accused of similar acts by a number of other women, which he has also denied. “You’re running, you’re trying to forget it happened, and then, of course, it catches up with you and I couldn’t run from it,” Wood said, explaining that she threw herself into therapy after years of vowing to “take it to my grave” over her fears about making her experience public. “I was that afraid of retaliation, I just did not feel safe and I felt very alone. I thought I was the only one.”
The latter sentiment is one she’s said is common among survivors of abuse, another reason she decided to share her story. After testifying in front of Congress for the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights in 2018, Wood said she thought she had said all there was to say, though at the time she did not publicly reveal her alleged abuser. But when people began emerging online with similar stories, with “very specific details,” she said she recognized as things you could not know unless you’d stood toe-to-toe with your abuser, she knew she had to break her silence.
“I knew it was real, and that’s when it changed,” she told Noah, adding that the film also tackles Manson’s own self-reported history of childhood trauma because, “I do believe in accountability and healing and reform and I think there is a time and a space for that.” Without going to the root of violence in the home, Wood said, we cannot see that “violence begets violence.”
“There are people who can stop the cycle and there are people, like Brian,” she said, naming Manson for the first and only time using his birth name more than half-way into the interview. “That don’t want help. And he’s had every opportunity. He’s had so many people try. And he has refused it every time.”
Wood also noted that the statute of limitations on sexual abuse was one-to-three years when she started advocating for the Phoenix Act in California — though she said it often takes 7-10 years to “process, understand and heal” from trauma — a time frame she described as “nothing” to a survivor still trying to come to terms with the physical, mental and emotional impact of abuse.
She pointed out that she spent a total of four years with “him” (presumably Manson), someone she called expert at “brainwashing” and isolation, comparing that time to being in a cult. “When you’re in it, you can’t see the forest through the trees, up is down, down is up. It’s you two against the world and it is a secret that nobody will ever be able to understand,” she said. “And you gotta to break free of that illusion, and it takes time.”

Evan Rachel Wood has insisted she's ""not scared"" of the defamation lawsuit filed against her by her ex Marilyn Manson.
The singer, 53, filed the suit at the LA Superior Court earlier this month in response to allegations of sexual assault and emotional abuse she made against him - something he categorically denies.
The Westworld actress, 34, claimed he had been abusive to her during their relationship which lasted from 2006 to 2010.
Responding to the lawsuit, Wood said she was confident the ""truth will come out"".
Speaking on The View on Monday, ahead of the release of her documentary Phoenix Rising: Don't Fall, she said: ""I can't, obviously, speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I am not scared.""
(Image: WireImage)
Manson - real name Brian Warner - has claimed in his suit that Wood and artist Illma Gore had come up with a ""conspiracy"" to smear him as a ""rapist and abuser"" in order to sabotage his ""successful music, TV, and film career"".
And in response, Wood has said that her ex's tactics are part of the systemic issues of people in power silencing accusers.
She said: ""I am sad, because this is how it works, this is what pretty much every survivor that tries to expose someone in a position of power goes through, and this is part of the retaliation that keeps survivors quiet.
""This is why people don't want to come forward, because this is - this was expected.""
She also said she was undaunted by the allegations brought against her by the artist in his suit.
She added: ""I am very confident that I have the truth on my side and that the truth will come out, and that this is clearly timed before the documentary - this is the reason.
""So yes, again, I'm not doing this to clear my name, I'm doing this to protect people. I'm doing this to sound the alarm that there's a dangerous person out there and I don't want anybody getting near him.

""People can think whatever they want about me, I have to let the legal process run its course. And I'm steady as a rock.""
During her appearance on the US talk show, Wood also opened up about the long-term effects of her alleged abuse at the hands of Manson.
She alleged: ""The acts of violence that he committed against me and a number of other victims - men and women - are absolutely horrific, but the most insidious thing that he did and that people like him do is they completely fracture your sense of self. He made me forget who I was, and it's taken me years to remember.
""And it's taken me years to get back to myself and to even understand what had happened to me, because I really thought I was the only one. And I didn't find out until much later that not only was I not the only one, but that there was a pattern to his abuse. And that means it's calculated, and that means he is not going to stop until he is stopped.""
(Image: ABC)
Wood, who addresses her allegations against Manson in her documentary, had stood up in Congress in 2018 to support the nationwide implementation of the Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights Act.
She delivered testimony about past sexual abuse but she did not name Manson at the time.
She went on to name him as her alleged abuser in an Instagram post last year.
She claimed Manson had ""started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years"".

Wood added: ""I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.""
Manson has since been accused of sexual assault by at least 15 other women, and has denied all the claims.
His lawyer Howard King has said in a statement: ""As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted. This is just more of the same.""
Manson's representative said: ""As we have stated from the beginning, Mr Warner vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone.""",2022-03-15T09:48:51Z,https://www.irishmirror.ie,Irish Mirror

The 53-year-old rocker – who has been accused of sexual and physical abuse by multiple women – is suing the ‘Westworld’ star for defamation, fraud, and emotional distress.
Manson alleges the 34-year-old actress – who was in a relationship with the Dope Show hitmaker between 2007 and 2010, and has claimed her former fiance “essentially raped” her while filming a music video – has “derailed his successful music, TV and film career.”
In response to the lawsuit, Evan said her ex is simply trying to silence her, “as expected,” and she knows the truth is on her side and is “confident” she will get justice.

Wood described several instances of alleged sexual abuse at the hands of Manson, which he's denied
In part one of ""Phoenix Rising,"" which chronicles Manson's alleged sexual abuse against Wood, the actress notes many experiences with her ex-fiancé.
Wood and Manson made their relationship public in 2007 when she was 19 and he was 38. The two were briefly engaged before their relationship ended in 2010.
In the documentary, directed by Amy Berg and premiering on HBO on Tuesday, Wood says that Manson ""essentially raped her"" when they filmed the music video for his 2007 song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)."" She also said that she has an ""M"" scar on her body, near her pelvic area, that Manson gave her during their relationship.
Manson's attorney, Howard King, previously denied to Insider that the incident occurred. ""Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth,"" he said in a statement earlier this year.
In part two of the documentary, Wood reveals that while making the 2011 HBO miniseries ""Mildred Pierce,"" she was pregnant with Manson's child and ultimately had an abortion.
""The second it was over [he] was like, 'Make me dinner,'"" the actress said in the documentary of what transpired following the abortion. ""And I remember being like, 'I'm supposed to be resting — my body has gone through this trauma, there's aftermath here.' And he didn't care.""

In response to this allegation, King gave Insider the following statement:
""As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore, or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted,"" it said. ""This is just more of the same.""
In the suit, Manson, whose birth name is Brian Warner, called Wood's accusations against him ""a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV and film career.""
The suit also alleges that Wood and her activist friend, Illma Gore (who is also in the documentary), ""impersonated an actual agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by forging and distributing a fictitious letter from the agent, to create the false appearance that Warner's alleged 'victims' and their families were in danger, and that there was a federal criminal investigation of Warner ongoing.""
Before the documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, Wood had made other allegations of abuse against Manson, including that he groomed her and he ""horrifically"" abused her as a teenager.
Manson has denied these allegations, calling them ""horrible distortions of reality"" in a February 2021 statement posted on Instagram.",2022-03-15T04:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Evan Rachel Wood speaks out about Marilyn Manson's defamation lawsuit,"Ahead of her two-part documentary 'Rising Phoenix' debuting on HBO this week, American actor and musician Evan Rachel Wood spoke out against a recent lawsuit Marilyn Manson filed against her. According to Variety, while making an appearance on 'The View', Wood said, ""I can't obviously speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I'm not scared. I am sad because this is how it works. This is what pretty much every survivor that tries to expose someone in a position of power goes though, and this is part of the retaliation that keeps survivors quiet.

The lawsuit was filed earlier this month by Manson, real name Brian Warner, who cited defamation over Wood's sexual abuse allegations against him and called them a ""malicious falsehood.""
Wood had reflected on her sexual abuse allegations against Manson and met survivors who also spoke out against the musician in 'Rising Phoenix'. Among several instances, she said was one when she was ""essentially raped on-camera"" while filming the 2007 music video for Manson's 'Heart-Shaped Glasses', the video of which featured Wood having sex with Manson.

Evan Rachel Wood Speaks About Marilyn Manson’s Defamation Lawsuit,"Evan Rachel Wood spoke publicly about Marilyn Manson’s lawsuit against her for the first time today on The View. “I can’t obviously speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I’m not scared,” she said. “I am sad, because this is how it works. This is what pretty much every survivor that tries to expose someone in a position of power goes though, and this is part of the retaliation that keeps survivors quiet. This is why people don’t want to come forward. This was expected.”
Manson (whose legal name is Brian Warner) sued Wood for defamation, emotional distress, and “impersonation over the internet” earlier this month.

In the suit, Manson alleged that Wood and her friend Ashley Gore, a.k.a. Illma Gore, impersonated an FBI agent and pressured other women to share false rape and sexual assault allegations against him.

Evan Rachel Wood Hits Back at Marilyn Manson's Lawsuit: I'm Not Scared,"Evan Rachel Wood appeared on “The View” ahead of her two-part documentary “Rising Phoenix” debuting on HBO this week and stood defiant against a recent lawsuit Marilyn Manson filed against her. “I can’t obviously speak about any of the specific allegations of the lawsuit, but I’m not scared,” Wood said. “I am sad, because this is how it works. This is what pretty much every survivor that tries to expose someone in a position of power goes though, and this is part of the retaliation that keeps survivors quiet. This is why people don’t want to come forward. This was expected.”
“I am very confident that I have the truth on my side and that the truth will come out,” Wood continued. “This is clearly timed before the documentary…I’m not doing this [film] to clear my name. I’m doing this to protect people. I’m doing this to sound the alarm that there is a dangerous person out there and I don’t want anybody getting near him. So people can think whatever they want about me. I have to let the legal process run its course, and I’m steady as a rock.”
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, filed a lawsuit against Wood earlier this month. The musician citied defamation over Wood’s sexual abuse allegations against him and called them a “malicious falsehood.” In the new documentary “Rising Phoenix,” the first part of which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January, Wood reflects on her sexual abuse allegations against Manson and meets survivors who also spoke out against the musician.
“Rising Phoenix” made headlines out of Sundance for including Wood saying she was “essentially raped on-camera” while filming the 2007 music video for Manson’s “Heart-Shaped Glasses.” The video features Wood having sex with Manson while fake blood rains down on them. Wood was 19 years old when she filmed the music video and alleges that she was fed absinthe on set to the point that she was barely conscious to object when Manson had sex with her on camera.
“Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the ‘Heart-Shaped Glasses’ music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses,” Manson’s attorney Howard King told Variety following the documentary’s Sundance debut.
The second part of “Rising Phoenix” recently garnered attention for a section in which Wood says Manson told her to make him dinner right after she got an abortion. Wood became pregnant with Manson’s child while making the 2011 HBO miniseries “Mildred Pierce.”
“He flew out for the abortion. I was just so scared and sad,” Wood says in the documentary. “I obviously believe in a woman’s right to choose, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t devastating…The second it was over [he] was like, ‘Make me dinner.’ And I remember being like, ‘I’m supposed to be resting — my body has gone through this trauma, there’s aftermath here.’ And he didn’t care.”
Wood also alleges in the second part of the documentary that Manson “refused to wear a condom, ever” during their relationship, adding, “And it was very much sex on demand, and it was going to cause more problems if I said no. You don’t have time to use birth control when somebody’s just penetrating you while you’re asleep or if they’ve given you a pill that made you black out.”
HBO will premiere “Phoenix Rising” on back-to-back nights. Part 1, “Phoenix Rising: Don’t Fall,” debuts Tuesday, March 15. Part 2, “Phoenix Rising: Stand Up,” debuts Wednesday, March 16. Both episodes will be available to stream on HBO Max beginning Tuesday, March 15.",2022-03-14T19:31:20Z,https://variety.com,Variety
"""Phoenix rising"": Skuespilleren som felte rockestjernen","«Phoenix rising»: Skuespilleren som felte rockestjernen
Da Evan Rachel Wood pekte på rockestjernen Marilyn Manson som overgriper, endte ti års kamp med en slags seier.
Skuespilleren Evan Rachel Wood navnga rockestjernen Marilyn Manson som sin overgriper. Dokumentaren «Phoenix rising» er hennes fortelling.
Asbjørn Slettemark Serieanmelder og journalist
Nå nettopp
Da Evan Rachel Wood 1. februar i fjor navnga en kjent rockestjerne som mannen som hadde mishandlet henne, var det ikke mange i film- eller musikkbransjen som ble overrasket. De hadde vært i et langt og offentlig forhold. I tiden etter snakket Wood om det hun hevdet var overgrep fra en ikke navngitt kjæreste.
Likevel slo de to første setningene ned som en liten internettbombe.",2022-03-13T07:00:00Z,https://www.aftenposten.no,Aftenposten
Evan Rachel Wood kommer med nye anklager mot Marilyn Manson,"I HBO-dokumentaren «Phoenix Rising», åpner Mansons ekskjæreste og skuespiller, Evan Rachel Wood opp om mishandlingen hun påstår musikeren utsatte henne for.
– Jeg var bare så redd og trist
I dokumentaren forteller hun at hun var gravid med Mansons barn i 2011, da hun spilte karakteren Veda Pierce i serien «Mildred Pierce». Selv om hun valgte å ta abort, var ikke dette noe skuespilleren tok lett på, ifølge flere utenlandske medier.
Wood forteller at Manson tok et fly for å være med under inngrepet, men skal ha blitt satt ut av måten han behandlet henne etter at aborten var gjennomført.
– Jeg var bare så redd og trist. Jeg tror åpenbart på kvinners rett til å velge, men det betyr ikke at det ikke var forferdelig, forteller hun i dokumentaren, som Insider har fått innsyn i.
«Phoenix Rising» har premiere på HBO 15. mars.

Nektet å bruke kondom
– Det sekundet det var over var han sånn: «Lag middag til meg». Jeg husker jeg tenkte: «Kroppen min har gått gjennom et traume som har ettervirkninger, og han brydde seg ikke», forteller skuespilleren om tiden etter aborten.
Videre i dokumentaren hevder hun at Manson alltid nektet å bruke kondom, og at hun ble presset til å ha sex.
– Han nektet å bruke kondom. Det var veldig mye press rundt sex, og det ville oppstå flere problemer hvis jeg sa nei. Du har ikke tid til å bruke prevensjon når noen bare trenger inn i deg mens du sover, eller hvis de har gitt deg en pille som får deg til å svime av, sier hun videre i dokumentaren.
Mener påstandene er falske
Skuespilleren forteller at hun slet så psykisk etter etter aborten at hun måtte oppsøke et psykisk helsesenter for å få hjelp.
Mansons advokat har tidligere benektet påstandene Wood kommer med mot Manson, som egentlig heter Brian Warner, og mener også at anklagene hun kommer med i denne dokumentaren ikke er sanne.
– Som vi beskrev i søksmålet vårt, kan ingenting som Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore eller deres håndplukkede medsammensvorne har sagt om denne saken stoles på, skrev advokat Howard King i en uttalelse til Insider.
– Dette er bare mer av det samme. Men igjen, hva annet kan man forvente av en gruppe som har spredt usannhet etter usannhet om Brian, og til og med gått så langt som å forfalske et FBI-brev for å fremme sine falske påstander?», står det videre.
Mener karrieren hans er ødelagt

Manson har blitt beskyldt for mishandlig av flere kvinner, blant annet artisten og kunstneren Illma Gore. Tidligere denne måneden saksøkte Manson Gore og Wood, fordi han mener beskyldningene mot han ikke stemmer og at de har ødelagt karrieren hans.
Han hevder også at Gore og Wood forfalsket et dokument, som fikk det til å se ut som at det pågikk en føderal kriminell etterforskning av han.
Wood har tidligere kommet med flere anklager mot Manson, og har blant annet hevdet at han misbrukte henne da hun var tenåring, noe musikeren benekter. I et innlegg på Instagram i 2021, kalte han påstandene for «forferdelige, forvrengninger av virkeligheten».",2022-03-08T20:25:34Z,https://www.tv2.no,TV 2
"Marilyn Manson: Neue, schwere Vorwürfe von Ex-Freundin Evan Rachel Wood","Er betäubte mich und vergewaltigte mich im Schlaf
Die Vorwürfe sind erschütternd und werden immer heftiger ...
Bereits 2021 gab Evan Rachel Wood (34) an, dass sie mehrere Jahre von ihrem Ex-Partner Marilyn Manson (53) missbraucht worden sei. Jetzt enthüllt sie in der HBO-Dokumentation „Phoenix Rising“ weitere schockierende Details, die Einblick in die Beziehung zu dem Sänger geben.
Manson habe sie unter Drogen gesetzt, mit allem von Meth bis zu Schlaftabletten, erzählt Wood und ergänzt: „Zu diesem Zeitpunkt fing er auch an, mich im Schlaf zu vergewaltigen.“
Den Moment, als sie während des Missbrauchs aufgewachte, beschreibt sie mit den Worten: „Ich dachte: ‚Bleib einfach liegen, bleib einfach liegen, beweg dich nicht, beweg dich einfach nicht.‘ Also blieb ich einfach schlaff und still liegen, bis es vorbei war, und dann, ich schwöre bei Gott, riss er einfach mein Bein herum und ging aus dem Raum.“

Außerdem musste Wood laut eigenen Aussagen eine Abtreibung durchführen, nachdem sie schwanger geworden war, weil Manson die Verhütung ablehnte.
„Von Beginn unserer Beziehung an hatte er immer ein Problem mit allen Verhütungsmitteln, die ich benutzte – und ich habe alle Arten von Verhütungsmitteln ausprobiert, um zu sehen, welche er mochte, und er mochte keine von ihnen, also wollte er im Grunde nicht, dass ich verhüte.“

Manson sei zwar für den Eingriff eingeflogen, doch habe er Wood danach alles andere als unterstützend behandelt: „Er ist für die Abtreibung hergeflogen. Kaum war sie vorbei, hieß es: ‘Mach mir was zu essen‘.“

Das Trauma hat Wood nicht richtig verarbeiten können, da sie laut ihrer Aussage nicht in der Lage war, ihrem Körper danach die benötigte Ruhe zu gönnen: „Und ich erinnere mich, dass ich sagte: ‘Ich sollte mich ausruhen – mein Körper hat dieses Trauma durchgemacht. Das gibt Nachwirkungen.‘ Und es war ihm egal.“

Evan Rachel Wood claims Marilyn Manson demanded dinner after abortion,"Actress Evan Rachel Wood has revealed more explosive claims against Marilyn Manson, including how she got pregnant.
Actress Evan Rachel Wood received an Emmy nomination for her role in “Mildred Pierce”, but away from the spotlight, she says, she lived in a constant nightmare.
In the second half of documentary Phoenix Rising, Wood, 34, reveals she realised she was pregnant with the baby of her alleged abuser, Marilyn Manson, while working on that 2011 miniseries, reports NY Post.
The two-part documentary set to air on HBO, beginning March 15, is directed by Oscar and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Berg.
“From the beginning of our relationship, he always had an issue with whatever birth control I was using — and I went through, like, every type to see which one he liked, and he didn’t like any of them, so essentially he didn’t want me using birth control,” Wood says in the film, whose first half premiered during the Sundance Film Festival in January.
She claims Manson refused to wear a condom and using spermicides after intercourse didn’t work.

Wood decided to terminate the pregnancy and was shocked when Manson demanded she cook him a meal directly after the abortion.
“He flew out for the abortion,” Wood says on camera. “The second it was over it was like, ‘Make me dinner.’ And I remember being like, ‘I’m supposed to be resting — my body has gone through this trauma … there’s aftermath here.’ And he didn’t care.”
The incident nearly drove her to end her own life. At a later, unspecified date, she says, she tried to kill herself.
“I went into the bathroom and I took [a] glass and I shattered it on the floor and just started digging at my wrists as hard as I could,” Wood tells her friend, the artist and activist Illma Gore.
While Wood’s suicide attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, it was a turning point, she says in the film.
“When I woke up, I felt different. I feel like whoever I was went to sleep and didn’t wake up that night, and this new version woke up and had to start rebuilding her life. I called my mom and I said, ‘I just tried to kill myself, and I need to go to a hospital, like, immediately.’ ”

Drugged and alone
The Westworld actress first identified 53-year-old Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, as her alleged abuser last February, after previously referring to a traumatic relationship with an anonymous man in the press.
Phoenix Rising tracks Wood’s decision to go public with his name, which ultimately came in the form of a statement posted on Instagram.

In the first part of the documentary, Wood’s explosive claims include Manson forcing her to have sex on camera for his 2007 music video Heart-Shaped Glasses.
Wood claims Manson’s abuse was incessant. She alleges that she was forced into isolation inside his Spanish-style Los Angeles home, where she says she was kept in “freezing cold” temperatures and deprived of sleep.
The True Blood actress also says she believes Manson drugged her, with everything from meth to sleeping pills.
“This is also when he started raping me in my sleep,” Wood says in the film’s second half. “I’d wake up, I just remember doing the mental math quickly and thinking, ‘Just stay, just stay asleep, don’t move, just don’t move.’ So I would just lie limp and still until it was over, and then I swear to God, he would just fling my leg and walk out of the room.”
More women’s stories
The day that Wood came forward with her charges last year, several other women followed suit — two of whom appear in the film’s second instalment.
The documentary shows them meeting together in October 2020, along with two former Manson assistants, including Dan Cleary, who had recently posted a viral Twitter thread about how the shock-rocker “turned [Wood] into a different person. He broke her.”
One of the women in the documentary, model Sarah McNeilly, whose own 2021 statement on Instagram included allegations that she was locked in rooms when she was “bad,” says that Manson “threw me up against a wall and had a baseball bat, and said he was gonna smash my f ***ing face in.”

The other is Ashley Morgan Smithline, who’s Jewish. In a 2021 Instagram post, she described Manson asking her to bring him Nazi memorabilia home from a modelling gig in Thailand, which made her feel “so much guilt and shame.”
“I remember this one time, it actually got physical — and he, like, threw me up against a wall and had a baseball bat, and said he was gonna smash my f***ing face in because I was trying to get him to pick out pants,” McNeilly says in the film.
Smithline, discussing how she wanted to escape Manson, reveals, “I let my appendix burst. It went gangrenous, I went septic. I was, like, ‘Just let me f***ing die, just let me die so I don’t have to feel this s**t.’ ”
After briefly fleeing Manson’s home in 2009, Wood later alleges that Manson lured her back in — and tells the group he did so through torture. Wood, who’s also Jewish, alleges Manson tied her to a prayer kneeler inside his home and struck her repeatedly with a Nazi whip. He then allegedly shocked her welts and her “private parts” with an electrode.
“It hurt so bad that I broke the kneeler in half,” Wood told the others. “I remember in that moment thinking, ‘Just tell him whatever he wants to hear, just tell him whatever he wants to hear’ … and I said, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’ I was begging for forgiveness, and he was cradling me and saying, ‘You understand now.’ And then he cut open his hand … and made me drink his blood. And then he cut me … and drank mine.”
Manson’s lawsuit
The film then shows headlines announcing Wood had gotten back together with Manson. One, from Perez Hilton, who began calling Wood “Evan Rachel Whore” following the Heart-Shaped Glasses video, proclaimed “Evan Rachel Whore and Marilyn Manson: ‘On’ Again!” with the word “HO” scrawled over her head.

“The allegations that Evan Rachel Wood has made against Marilyn Manson are recent,” Hilton told The Post in a statement when asked for comment on his coverage. “I believe her.”
To date, at least 15 women have accused Manson of sexual, emotional and physical abuse; authorities have launched an investigation, but no charges have been brought.
On Wednesday, Manson sued Wood in LA Superior Court, charging that she and Gore have defamed him with rape allegations for their own monetary gain and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him.
The suit alleges that Wood’s 2021 Instagram statement came after “months of conspiring with Gore on how to use Wood’s celebrity status to recruit other women and co-ordinate their ‘stories,’ ” but also that they “derailed [Manson’s] career” and used Phoenix Rising to “recruit, co-ordinate, and pressure women who had been linked to Warner to make false accusations of abuse against him.”
“As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted,” Manson’s lawyer, Howard King, told The Post in a statement regarding the film. “This is just more of the same.”

I was just so scared and sad,” Wood says in the documentary. “I obviously believe in a woman’s right to choose, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t devastating…The second it was over [he] was like, ‘Make me dinner.’ And I remember being like, ‘I’m supposed to be resting — my body has gone through this trauma, there’s aftermath here.’ And he didn’t care.”
Wood alleges in the documentary that Manson “refused to wear a condom, ever” during their relationship, adding, “And it was very much sex on demand, and it was going to cause more problems if I said no. You don’t have time to use birth control when somebody’s just penetrating you while you’re asleep or if they’ve given you a pill that made you black out.”
Wood and Manson made their relationship public in 2007 when she was 19 years old and he was 38. The two had a brief engagement before their relationship ended in 2010. Wood speaks to her activist friend Illma Gore in the documentary and says she tried to commit suicide after her relationship to Manson ended.
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, filed a lawsuit against Wood earlier this month. The musician citied defamation over Wood’s sexual abuse allegations against him and called them a “malicious falsehood.”
In a statement to Insider about the new allegations made in part two of “Phoenix Rising,” Manson’s attorney Howard King said, “As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted. This is just more of the same. But, then again, what else would you expect from a group who have spread falsehood after falsehood about Brian and even went as far as to forge an FBI letter to further their phony claims?”
In the first part of “Rising Phoenix,” which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January, Wood says she was “essentially raped on-camera” while filming the 2007 music video for Manson’s “Heart-Shaped Glasses.” The video features Wood having sex with Manson while fake blood rains down on them. Wood was 19 years old when she filmed the music video and alleges that she was fed absinthe on set to the point that she was barely conscious to object when Manson had sex with her on camera.
In a previous statement to Variety, Manson’s attorney Howard King said: “Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the ‘Heart-Shaped Glasses’ music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses.”
HBO will premiere “Phoenix Rising” on back-to-back nights. Part 1, “Phoenix Rising: Don’t Fall,” debuts Tuesday, March 15. Part 2, “Phoenix Rising: Stand Up,” debuts Wednesday, March 16. Both episodes will be available to stream on HBO Max beginning Tuesday, March 15.",2022-03-07T18:46:45Z,https://variety.com,Variety
More shocking Marilyn Manson abuse allegations,"Actress Evan Rachel Wood received an Emmy nomination for her role in “Mildred Pierce” — but away from the spotlight, she says she lived in a constant nightmare.
In the second half of “Phoenix Rising” — a two-part documentary set to air on HBO, beginning March 15, that’s directed by Oscar- and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Berg — Wood, 34, reveals she realized she was pregnant with the baby of her alleged abuser, Marilyn Manson, while working on that 2011 miniseries.
“From the beginning of our relationship, he always had an issue with whatever birth control I was using — and I went through, like, every type to see which one he liked, and he didn’t like any of them, so essentially he didn’t want me using birth control,” Wood says in the film, whose first half premiered during the Sundance Film Festival in January. She claims that Manson refused to wear a condom, and using spermicides after intercourse didn’t work.
Wood decided to terminate the pregnancy — and was shocked when Manson demanded she cook him a meal directly after the abortion.

“He flew out for the abortion,” Wood says on camera. “The second it was over it was like, ‘Make me dinner.’ And I remember being like, ‘I’m supposed to be resting — my body has gone through this trauma . . . there’s aftermath here.’ And he didn’t care.”
The incident nearly drove her to end her own life. At a later, unspecified, date, she says she tried to kill herself.
“I went into the bathroom and I took [a] glass and I shattered it on the floor and just started digging at my wrists as hard as I could,” Wood tells her friend, the artist and activist Illma Gore.
While Wood’s suicide attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, it was a turning point, she says in the film. “When I woke up, I felt different. I feel like whoever I was went to sleep and didn’t wake up that night, and this new version woke up and had to start rebuilding her life. I called my mom and I said, ‘I just tried to kill myself, and I need to go to a hospital, like, immediately.’ ”

Drugged and alone
The “Westworld” actress first identified 53-year-old Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, as her alleged abuser last February, after previously referring to a traumatic relationship with an anonymous man in the press. “Phoenix Rising” tracks Wood’s decision to go public with his name, which ultimately came in the form of a statement posted on Instagram. In the first part of the documentary, Wood’s explosive claims include Manson forcing her to have sex on camera for his 2007 music video “Heart-Shaped Glasses.”
Wood claims Manson’s abuse was incessant. She alleges that she was forced into isolation inside his Spanish-style Los Angeles home where she says she was kept in “freezing cold” temperatures and deprived of sleep.
At least 15 women have accused Manson, real name Brian Warner, of sexual, emotional and physical abuse, but no charges have been brought. Kurt Krieger – Corbis
The “True Blood” actress also says she believes Manson drugged her, with everything from meth to sleeping pills.
“This is also when he started raping me in my sleep,” Wood says in the film’s second half. “I’d wake up, I just remember doing the mental math quickly and thinking, ‘Just stay, just stay asleep, don’t move, just don’t move.’ So I would just lie limp and still until it was over, and then I swear to God, he would just fling my leg and walk out of the room.”
More women’s stories
The day that Wood came forward with her charges last year, several other women followed suit — two of whom appear in the film’s second installment. The documentary shows them meeting together in October of 2020, along with two former Manson assistants, including Dan Cleary, who had recently posted a viral Twitter thread about how the shock-rocker “turned [Wood] into a different person. He broke her.”
One of the women, identified only as Sarah, is model Sarah McNeilly, whose own 2021 statement on Instagram included allegations that she was locked in rooms when she was “bad” and “sometimes forced to listen to [Manson] entertaining other women.”

The other, identified only as Ashley S., is Ashley Morgan Smithline, who’s Jewish. In a 2021 Instagram post, she described Manson asking her to bring him Nazi memorabilia home from a modeling gig in Thailand, which made her feel “so much guilt and shame.”
“I remember this one time, it actually got physical — and he, like, threw me up against a wall and had a baseball bat, and said he was gonna smash my f – – king face in because I was trying to get him to pick out pants,” McNeilly says in the film. Smithline, discussing how she wanted to escape Manson, reveals, “I let my appendix burst. It went gangrenous, I went septic. I was, like, ‘Just let me f – – king die, just let me die so I don’t have to feel this s – – t.’ ”
Ashley Morgan Smithline also came forward with her own allegations against Manson. ashleylindsaymorgan/Instagram
After briefly fleeing Manson’s home in 2009, Wood later alleges that Manson lured her back in — and tells the group he did so through torture. Wood, who’s also Jewish, alleges Manson tied her to a prayer kneeler inside his home and struck her repeatedly with a Nazi whip. He then allegedly shocked her welts and her “private parts” with an electrode.
“It hurt so bad that I broke the kneeler in half,” Wood told the others. “I remember in that moment thinking, ‘Just tell him whatever he wants to hear, just tell him whatever he wants to hear’ . . . and I said, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.’ I was begging for forgiveness, and he was cradling me and saying, ‘You understand now.’ And then he cut open his hand . . . and made me drink his blood. And then he cut me . . . and drank mine.”
Manson’s lawsuit
The film then shows headlines announcing Wood had gotten back together with Manson. One, from Perez Hilton, who began calling Wood “Evan Rachel Whore” following the “Heart-Shaped Glasses” video, proclaimed “Evan Rachel Whore and Marilyn Manson: ‘On’ Again!” with the word “HO” scrawled over her head.
“The allegations that Evan Rachel Wood has made against Marilyn Manson are recent,” Hilton told The Post in a statement when asked for comment on his coverage. “I believe her.”
To date, at least 15 women have accused Manson of sexual, emotional and physical abuse; authorities have launched an investigation, but no charges have been brought.
Manson sued Wood in LA Superior Court last week. Vera Anderson
On Wednesday, Manson sued Wood in LA Superior Court, charging that she and Gore have defamed him with rape allegations for their own monetary gain and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon him. The suit alleges that Wood’s 2021 Instagram statement came after “months of conspiring with Gore on how to use Wood’s celebrity status to recruit other women and coordinate their ‘stories,’ ” but also that they “derailed [Manson’s] career” and used “Phoenix Rising” to “recruit, coordinate, and pressure women who had been linked to Warner to make false accusations of abuse against him.”
“As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted,” Manson’s attorney, Howard King, told The Post in a statement regarding the film. “This is just more of the same.”",2022-03-07T15:00:00Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post

Wood says in ""Phoenix Rising"" that after the abortion, she became suicidal. ""I was worried that I was going to try to kill myself,"" she added.

""I got off the bus and it just hit me the second I got off the bus, I just said, 'I'm going to die tonight. I can't go any further,'"" she tells Gore in the documentary.
""I went into the bathroom and I took [a] glass and I shattered it on the floor and just started digging at my wrists as hard as I could,"" Wood continues. ""I called my mom and I said, 'I just tried to kill myself, and I need to go to a hospital, like, immediately.'""

In response to Wood's allegations that Manson, whose birth name is Brian Warner, told her to make him dinner following her abortion, Manson's lawyer Howard King gave Insider the following statement:
""As we detailed in our lawsuit, nothing that Evan Rachel Wood, Illma Gore, or their hand-picked co-conspirators have said on this matter can be trusted. This is just more of the same. But, then again, what else would you expect from a group who have spread falsehood after falsehood about Brian and even went as far as to forge an FBI letter to further their phony claims?""
On March 2, Manson filed a defamation lawsuit against Wood over her allegations that he sexually abused her, calling his ex-fianceé's accusations against him ""a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV, and film career.""
The filing also alleges that Wood and Gore ""impersonated an actual agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by forging and distributing a fictitious letter from the agent, to create the false appearance that Warner's alleged 'victims' and their families were in danger, and that there was a federal criminal investigation of Warner ongoing.""
Part one of the documentary, which airs on March 15, chronicles Woods' accusations that Manson ""essentially raped her"" when they filmed the music video for his 2007 song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)"" and that she has an ""M"" scar on her body, near her pelvic area, that Manson gave her during their relationship.
Manson's attorney previously denied to Insider that the two had sex on set. ""Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth,"" he said in a statement earlier this year.
Wood has previously made other allegations of abuse against Manson, including that he groomed her and he ""horrifically"" abused her as a teenager. Manson has denied these allegations, calling them ""horrible distortions of reality"" in a February 2021 statement posted on Instagram.",2022-03-07T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Evan Rachel Wood teve de cozinhar para Manson após abortar filho dele,"As duas partes do documentário ""Phoenix Rising"", da HBO, promete trazer à tona detalhes ainda mais chocantes do abusos que o cantor Marilyn Manson, 53, teria cometido contra a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, 34, enquanto se relacionaram entre 2007 e 2010.
Segundo informações adiantadas hoje pelo jornal ""New York Post"", Wood declara à produção que era proibida pelo então namorado de usar métodos contraceptivos e que o estopim para sua tentativa de suicídio em 2011 foi a forma como ele a tratou após ela abortar um filho do casal, com o aval do músico.
""Desde o início do nosso relacionamento, ele sempre teve problemas com qualquer anticoncepcional que eu estivesse usando. Passei por todos os tipos para ver qual ele gostava, e ele não gostava de nenhum deles. Então, essencialmente, ele não queria que eu usasse anticoncepcionais"", relata a atriz em um trecho inédito do documentário.
""Ele ignorou o aborto. No segundo em que acabou [o procedimento], disse algo como: 'faça-me o jantar.' Lembro-me de pensar: 'eu tenho que, meu corpo passou por esse trauma, há consequências...' E ele não se importou"", detalha Evan, que tentou acabar com a própria vida pouco depois. ""Entrei no banheiro e peguei um copo e o quebrei no chão e comecei a enfiar nos meus pulsos o máximo que pude.""
""Phoenix Rising"" tem estreia confirmada para o próximo dia 15 (terça-feira) no canal HBO norte-americano e também na plataforma de streaming HBO Max.

"Após Depp e Heard, Marilyn Manson e Evan Rachel Wood estrelam disputa judicial","A atriz tinha 22 anos quando decidiu terminar o namoro de quatro anos, entre idas e vindas que incluíram um noivado, com o cantor
Nas considerações finais do advogado de Amber Heard, no julgamento em que saiu perdedora, com uma dívida de US$ 8,35 milhões a ser paga para seu ex-marido, Johnny Depp, que a processou por difamação, Benjamin Rottenborn descreveu para o júri o dilema por que passam muitas vítimas de violência doméstica. “Se você não fez fotos, não aconteceu; se fez, elas são falsas. Se não contou para os amigos, está mentindo; se contou, eles fazem parte do conluio.”
A atriz Evan Rachel Wood, de 34 anos, conhece bem esse dilema. Ela tinha 22 anos quando decidiu terminar um namoro de quatro anos, entre idas e vindas que incluíram um breve noivado, com o cantor Marilyn Manson.
Ele deu uma entrevista para a revista Spin depois do rompimento em que confirmou que a música “I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies”, quero te matar com fazem nos filmes, em tradução livre, era sobre as fantasias que tinha “todos os dias de esmagar a cabeça dela com uma marreta”.
Foi só em 2016, seis anos depois do fim do namoro, após ter virado ativista pelo direito das vítimas de violência doméstica, que Rachel Wood declarou publicamente que havia sido abusada sexualmente. Mas não revelou quem era o abusador, por medo de retaliação. Isso só aconteceu em fevereiro do ano passado, quando afirmou que havia sido manipulada, drogada e torturada repetidas vezes por Marilyn Manson, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Warner.
Entre uma coisa e outra, Rachel Wood se casou brevemente com o ator inglês Jamie Bell –o vilão da série “Iluminadas”, com Elizabeth Moss e Wagner Moura–, teve um filho, se mudou para um chalé nas montanhas e se descobriu bissexual.
Este ano, lançou um documentário em duas partes, “Renascendo das Cinzas”, que a HBO Max botou no ar há mais de um mês sem nenhuma promoção, porque o título não era uma prioridade do canal.
Em “Renascendo das Cinzas”, ela revê toda a história de sua vida, dos anos que viveu com Marilyn Manson, de como o namoro começou com uma amizade entre dois artistas e se transformou em uma relação doentia, até os dias de hoje, em que ainda não tem coragem de revelar onde mora, mas nos quais luta para “consertar essa sociedade, que instintivamente culpa as mulheres”.
CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE
O caso de Rachel Wood e Marilyn Manson é diferente do de Amber Heard e Johnny Depp. Marilyn Manson tem um histórico gigante de abusos. Em uma das cenas do documentário, Rachel Wood reúne outras seis vítimas do cantor, que contam histórias semelhantes à dela, de humilhação, tortura, lavagem cerebral, estupro, alienação dos amigos e da família.
Johnny Depp passou a vida adulta quase inteira namorando mulheres famosas que nunca o acusaram de nenhuma violência. Foi casado durante 14 anos com a atriz e cantora francesa Vanessa Paradis, e todo mundo viu no julgamento o testemunho da top model Kate Moss, que viveu com ele durante quatro anos e negou que ele tenha tido qualquer atitude agressiva com ela.
Mas as partes que coincidem são suficientes para incomodar. Primeiro, os dois homens são amigos há muitos anos. Marilyn Manson é padrinho do filho mais novo de Depp e Paradis, Jack Depp, que já tem 20 anos. Ele estava na primeira lista de possíveis testemunhas chamadas pelos advogados de Amber Heard, que descobriram, no celular de Depp, várias mensagens em que os dois combinavam transações de drogas.
E, em março, assim que o documentário foi lançado nos Estados Unidos, Marilyn Manson entrou com uma ação civil no Tribunal Superior de Los Angeles contra Evan Rachel Wood, alegando que as acusações da ex-namorada são uma grande mentira, e que por causa delas já perdeu contratos com gravadoras e trabalhos na TV e o cinema.

"Marilyn Manson : Accusé de viol par son ex Evan Rachel Wood, il porte plainte","Marilyn Manson est bien décidé à ne pas se laisser faire. Alors que son ex compagne Evan Rachel Wood a déposé plainte contre lui pou viol, le chanteur a décidé de la poursuivre pour diffamation.
Il a décidé de contre-attaquer. Le 1er février dernier, Evan Rachel Wood accusait Marilyn Manson, son ex-compagnon de viol et d'agression sexuelle. Des faits qui se seraient déroulés entre 2006 et 2010. Une plainte qui s'ajoute aux graves accusations portées contre le chanteur. En effet, de nombreuses femmes ont porté plainte contre l'artiste notamment pour viol, abus physique, émotionnel et psychologique. Si Marilyn Manson ne s'était exprimé à ce sujet qu'en niant les faits sur Instagram, voilà que le chanteur a décidé de déposer plainte contre son ex-compagne Evan Rachel Wood.
En effet, Brian Warner, de son vrai nom, a décidé de saisir la justice pour propos diffamatoires, comme il l'a annoncé, ce mercredi 2 mars : ""Arrivera le moment où je pourrai en dire plus sur les événements de l'année dernière. D'ici là, je vais laisser les faits parler d'eux-mêmes"", a-t-il écrit sur Instagram, en relayant un lien qui renvoie vers la plainte qu'il a déposée contre Evan Rachel Wood et sa compagne Ashley Gore. Marilyn Manson les accuse de s'être fait passer pour des membres du FBI et d'être allés distribuer des courriers attestant de la culpabilité du chanteur.
Des contrats annulés
L'artiste les accuse aussi d'avoir rédigé et distribué des témoignages de certaines femmes faisant état des violences qu'elles auraient subi de la part de Marilyn Manson qui est bien décidé à ne pas se laisser faire. En effet, la star est lâché de toutes parts : son rôle dans American Gods et ainsi que dans Creepshow a été annulé. Ses contrats avec le label de musique Loma Vista Recordings et l'agence artistique CAA ont eux aussi été annulés. Marilyn Manson tente donc de redorer son image en poursuivant son ex compagne devant la justice.

Marilyn Manson risponde alle accuse di abusi sessuali di Evan Rachel Wood e le fa causa per diffamazione,"Secondo le accuse mosse dai legali di Manson le due donne avrebbero mentito sul coinvolgimento dell'FBI per simulare una presunta indagine federale sul conto della star. La Wood e Gore avrebbero anche reclutato e coordinato un gruppo di donne, offrendo ""documenti e una lista dei presunti abusi per cui avrebbero dovuto accusarlo"", tra cui ""l’affermazione diffamatoria che Warner abbia ripreso in video abusi sessuali su un minore"". Falsità, come si legge nella denuncia, ""che ne hanno deragliato una carriera di successo nella musica come nel cinema e nella tv"".
Lo stesso Manson ha pubblicato sui suoi profili social tutto il documento legale spiegando: ""Verrà il momento in cui potrò condividere più sugli eventi dell'ultimo anno. Fino ad allora lascerò che parlino i fatti da soli"". Nella causa vengono fatte quattro denunce: diffamazione, hacking della mail di Warner, furto d’identità e frode.
""La denuncia è stata depositata per fermare una campagna di attacchi pericolosi e ingiustificati verso Brian Warner», ha detto l’avvocato Howard King, spiegando: ""Anni dopo la fine della relazione con Evan Rachel Wood, lei e l’amica Illma Gore hanno reclutato molte donne e le hanno convinte a confermare accuse false, accuse che sono state sceneggiate da Wood e Gore in persona. HBO e i produttori del documentario erano consapevoli delle loro azioni, ma hanno deciso di procedere comunque. Le prove però sono inconfutabili e questa causa le richiamerà alle loro responsabilità"".
Sempre secondo il documento la Gore sarebbe entrata nell'account di Manson illegalmente e avrebbe anche creato falsi indirizzi mail per provare che Warner scambiasse materiali pedopornografici. ""Ha usato le informazioni ottenute per orchestrare e diffondere le sue false accuse contro Warner, accuse che hanno attirato l’attenzione su Wood, il film e il Phoenix Act, oltre a convincere altre donne a unirsi a loro"".
""Phoenix Rising"" è stato presentato in anteprima al Sundance Film Festival 2022. Nel documentario Evan Rachel Wood sostiene di essere stata violentata da Manson nel 2007 durante le riprese del video del brano ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"". L'ex fidanzata ha poi accusato la rockstar di aver abusato di lei per anni, seguita a ruota da altre ex fidanzate del cantante che hanno poi racconta la loro esperienza. Manson, finito nella bufera con la sua casa discografica che ha interrotto il contratto, ha poi respinto le accuse sui social bollando le parole della ex come ""orribili distorsioni della realtà"".

Marilyn Manson accusa la ex di cospirazione sul caso di stupro,"LOS ANGELES - Diffamazione, cospirazione e sostituzione di persona. Secondo Marilyn Manson l'ex fidanzata Evan Rachel Wood lo ha denunciato per averla stuprata durante le riprese di un video solo per distruggere la sua carriera.
La denuncia del cantante gotico è stata depositata oggi a Los Angeles e in questa viene affermato che Wood insieme a Illma Gore hanno inventato e montato ad arte un caso di stupro. Inoltre, Manson, oltre a sostenere che il tutto fosse volto a distruggere la sua carriera, accusando quindi le due donne di diffamazione e cospirazione, afferma che Wood e Gore sono colpevoli di sostituzione di persona. In pratica avrebbero tentato d'impersonare un agente dell'Fbi che serviva a fare pressione su «potenziali accusatori affinché emergessero contemporaneamente accuse di stupro e abuso» contro di lui.
Secondo il cantante, le azioni delle due sono state «invasive, moleste, diffamatorie e dannose». Manson ha pubblicato su Twitter gli atti del tribunale, aggiungendo che «verrà un momento in cui potrò raccontare di più su quanto accaduto nell'ultimo anno. Ma fino a quel giorno, lascerò che siano i fatti a parlare».
Questo mese è prevista l'uscita del documentario ""Phoenix Rising"" in cui l'ex fidanzata e diverse altre donne testimoniano le violenze subite da parte di Manson.",2022-03-03T19:00:00Z,https://www.tio.ch,20 minuti Ticino

El músico Marilyn Manson demandó a su expareja y actriz Evan Rachel Wood por presuntamente difamarlo al acusarlo de violación y animar a otras mujeres a presentar denuncias por otros delitos sexuales.
Manson registró esta denuncia en los juzgados de Los Ángeles apenas dos semanas antes de que la plataforma HBO estrene la serie documental ""Phoenix Rising"", en la que la actriz relata su turbulenta relación con el cantante, a quien culpó de violarla durante la grabación del videoclip ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"".
El músico, que negó los hechos, ha respondido a esas denuncias con una demanda en la que acusa a Wood y a una colaboradora suya, Ashley Gore, de ""reclutar, coordinar y presionar"" a otras mujeres para que testifiquen contra él.
TESTIGO CLAVE
Según Manson (cuyo nombre real es Brian Warner), las dos mujeres escribieron una carta en la que se hacían pasar por un agente del FBI que estaba investigando al músico.
Dicha misiva habría presionado a los receptores para que demandaran a Manson y además facilitaba un supuesto ""guion"" con una lista de delitos que debían narrar a las autoridades.
Sin embargo, de acuerdo con la cadena NBC, que ha tenido acceso a ese documento, el escrito al que se refiere el músico no incluye el logotipo del FBI y presenta a Wood como ""testigo clave"" de una investigación criminal hacia una ""figura pública muy conocida"".
EL DOCUMENTAL
HBO estrenará en dos semanas el documental que repasa las acusaciones contra Manson y sigue la campaña que Wood y Gore llevaron a cabo para que California aprobara una ley que ampliaba las protecciones a las víctimas de delitos sexuales, conocida como ""Phoenix Act"".
Dicha producción se presentó a principios de este año en el Festival de Sundance y acaparó titulares ya que en ella Wood acusa a Manson de violarla ante las cámaras de un rodaje.
""Hablamos de una escena de sexo simulada, pero una vez que las cámaras comenzaron a grabar, comenzó a penetrarme de verdad. Nunca había accedido a eso. Fue un completo caos. No me sentí segura. Nadie cuidaba de mí. Fue una experiencia realmente traumatizante"", explica en la cinta.
Inmediatamente después del pase del documental, el abogado del músico, Howard King, negó las acusaciones.
RODAJE PERTURBADOR
Sin embargo, la revista Rolling Stone publicó un reportaje en el que trabajadores del rodaje aseguraban que llegaron a cancelarlo por las incómodas escenas de sexo y las continuas discusiones entre Manson, los productores y miembros del equipo.
Por su parte, el año pasado la Policía de Los Ángeles abrió una investigación contra Manson tras la denuncias de Wood y de otras cuatro mujeres como la estilista Love Bailey, quien dijo en redes sociales: ""Cuando alguien como Marilyn Manson te apunta con una pistola a la cabeza, es hora de hablar"".

LOS ANGELES -- Rocker Marilyn Manson sued his former fiancee, ""Westworld"" actor Evan Rachel Wood, on Wednesday over her allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship.The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges that Wood's allegations were fabricated, and that she and another woman named as a defendant, Illma Gore, used false pretenses including a phony letter from the FBI to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say about Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner.The lawsuit, which claims defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, says Wood publicly cast Manson ""as a rapist and abuser - a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV, and film career.""Wood and Gore have not yet filed a response to the lawsuit. An email to representatives of Wood seeking comment was not immediately returned.Manson and Wood revealed they were a couple in 2007, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.In 2017, when the #MeToo movement gained momentum, Wood said she had been raped and abused, and she gave testimony to a Congressional committee in 2018, both without naming anyone.

And police began an investigation of Manson.An HBO documentary on the allegations premieres March 15.The lawsuit filed Wednesday says that Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship, and she said nothing of his abusing her for 10 years until she met Gore, an artist whom the lawsuit describes as Wood's on-again, off-again romantic partner.It alleged that Wood and Gore engaged in a conspiracy that ""recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner, and brazenly claim that it took ten or more years to 'realize' their consensual relationships with Warner were supposedly abusive.""The lawsuit says the women impersonated and forged a letter from a real FBI agent to create the false impression that women and their families were in danger from Manson, who was under federal investigation.It alleges they provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, describing claims to make and how to make them.Copies of the letter and the lists are included as exhibits in the lawsuit.It also alleges the women hacked Manson's email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was emailing illegal pornography, and ""swatted"" him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home and draw further attention to the allegations.The lawsuit says that some women who were contacted refused to take part because they were being asked to say things that were untrue.""This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,"" Manson's attorney Howard King said in a statement.Wood has not taken legal action against Manson.

March 3 (UPI) -- Marilyn Manson filed a lawsuit Wednesday against his former fiancée, Evan Rachel Wood, accusing the actress of defamation and conspiring to sabotage his career, according to documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Manson, the shock rocker who rose to fame in the 1990s and whose real name is Brian Warner, accuses Evan Rachel Wood, along with actor and artist Illma Gore, of manufacturing sexual abuse claims against him in order to profit.

The complaint also alleges Wood and Gore were responsible for hacking into his computer and social media accounts, and impersonating an FBI agent, the Los Angeles Times reported.
In the complaint, Warner asked for a jury trial as well as for Wood and Gore to stop the actions he is alleging.
The court filing shows Warner accuses both women of intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act and impersonation over the Internet.
""This action arises from the wrongful and illegal acts done in furtherance of a conspiracy by Defendant Evan Rachel Wood and her on-again, off-again romantic partner, Defendant Ashley Gore, a/k/a Illma Gore, to publicly cast Plaintiff Brian Warner, p/k/a Marilyn Manson, as a rapist and abuser-a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV, and film career,"" the complaint reads.

Wood, 34, testified in 2018 in front of a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing about sexual abuse. At the time, she said she had been raped on two separate occasions, but did not mention the names of the men.
Wood dated Warner from the time she was 18 until she was 23. They were engaged for eight months in 2010.
She works with The Phoenix Act, a group of survivors advocating for greater legal protections for survivors of domestic violence.
Warner's lawyers allege the group is a front, created for leveling false accusations against the musician.
The complaint refers to Gore as ""a grifter who understood that an organized attack on Warner -- spearheaded by Wood's own fabricated revelation of rape and abuse -- could benefit them both,"" according to the LA Times.
""With Gore's help, Wood could be rebranded, from someone who 'still might best be known for dating Marilyn Manson a decade ago,' into an outspoken standard bearer for victims of domestic violence or sexual assault -- thereby absolving her reputation for having a 'wild past' and her embarrassment for having been in a long-term relationship with Marilyn Manson,"" lawyer Howard King writes in the complaint and obtained by The Times.

Marilyn Manson has reportedly launched legal action against his ex-girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood.
The Tainted Love singer, 53, alleges in a new lawsuit that his former partner conspired with her on-again, off-again girlfriend, Illma Gore, to commit fraud and develop a conspiracy in order to defame him, according to PageSix.
In the complaint, filed on Wednesday, Manson alleges that the Frozen 2 actress, 34, is guilty of intentionally inflicting emotional distress, defamation, impersonation and violating the Computer Data and Access Fraud Act.
Lawyers for the singer - real name Brian Hugh Warner - allegedly claim that their client's ex-girlfriend never accused the singer of abuse during their time together from 2006 until 2010.
They add that Ms Wood didn't make any allegations against her former partner until 10 years after their split, when she met her ""on-again, off-again romantic partner"", real name Ashley Gore, who they allege is a ""grifter who understood that an organized attack on Warner — spearheaded by Wood’s own fabricated revelation of rape and abuse — could benefit them both.""

Mr Warner's legal team claim that Ms Woods motivation for accusing their client of abusing her was to ""absolve her reputation"" for having a ""wild past"".
They allege that Ms Wood and Ms Gore created a fake email address to make it appear like their client had sent ""illicit pornography"", and also claim the pair provided checklists and scripts listing specific acts of abuse for prospective accusers to claim against Mr Warner.
The lawsuit also claims that the Ms Wood and Ms Gore gained access to the singer's personal computer files, social media accounts and used his Social Security Number without his permission.

On Thursday March 3, Ms Gore took to her verified Twitter account to share several tweets.
In one tweet, she wrote: ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.""
In the legal documents, Mr Warner accuses his former fiancée and Ms Gore of sending fake letters ""attributed to a real-life federal agent and included a forged signature and fake phone number for that agent"" warning his accusers of being in danger.
The complaint alleges that the FBI agent reference on the letter has stated she did not write or approve the note and claims she had no prior knowledge it exisited.

In 2018, Ms Wood appeared in front of Congress in support of the nationwide implementation of the Sexual Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights Acts, recalling her own experience of abuse at the hands of an unnamed abuser.
In her testimony, the mum-of-one claimed the abuse she experienced had been physical, sexual and emotional, and that she had subsequently been diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
After speculation led to many to believe Mr Warner was the abuser, a representative for the singer released a statement in November 2020, saying: ""Unfortunately, we live in a time where people believe what they read on the Internet, and feel free to say what they want with no actual evidence.
(Image: REX)
""The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non fact based information is wholly irresponsible.""
In February 2021, Ms Wood named Mr Warner as her alleged abuser via her Instagram account, where four other women also made allegations against the singer.
Ms Wood is set to star in a new two-part HBO documentary regarding her allegations, due to premiere later this month.
In a preview for the project, titled Phoenix Rising, the actress claims Mr Warner allegedly violated her in 2007 during the filming of his music video Heart-Shaped Glasses, which she starred in.
(Image: @evanrachelwood/Twitter)
""It's nothing like I thought it was going to be,"" she recalls in a clip taken from the documentary.
""We're doing things that were not what was pitched to me ... we had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real.
""I had never agreed to that. I'm a professional actress, I've been doing this my whole life; I've never been on a set that unprofessional in my life up until this day.""
(Image: Getty)
She adds in the preview: ""It was complete chaos. I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me. It was a really traumatizing experience filming the video. I didn't know how to advocate for myself or know how to say no because I had been conditioned and trained to never talk back, to just soldier through.""
Speaking via a statement given to The Guardian, Howard King, Mr Warner’s attorney said: ""Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts.
""But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable – and this legal action will hold them to account.""
Ms Wood claims she was previously ""scared"" to expose her former fiancé's alleged abuse.
Mr Warner has always denied all allegations of abuse and wrongdoing attributed to him.

"Marilyn Manson denuncia Evan Rachel Wood, ""falsità dannose sugli abusi""","Marilyn Manson denuncia per diffamazione l'ex fidanzata Evan Rachel Wood dopo che lei lo ha accusato di violenze
A un anno di distanza dalle accuse di abusi sessuali che l'ex fidanzata Evan Rachel Wood gli ha rivolto, l'artista Marilyn Manson la cita in giudizio per diffamazione, per le ""falsità dannose"" contenute nelle sue accuse, che - stando al cantante - gli sono valse il declino della carriera musicale, cinematografica e televisiva.
L'attrice 34enne che interpreta Madonna in Weird, il film in produzione dedicato alla vita e alla carriera del cantautore e comico Usa Al Yankovich, ha accusato Manson di averla ""adescata"" quando era ancora un'adolescente e ""manipolata fino alla sottomissione"", abusando di lei per anni. La donna ha anche sostenuto di essere stata ""violentata davanti alla telecamera"", durante le riprese del video ""Heart-Shapped-Glass"" del 2007.
Marilyn Mason, la denuncia contro l'attrice e l'amica Illma Gore
La denuncia da Manson è stata presentata mercoledì mattina, alla Corte superiore di Los Angeles. Il musicista ha accusato l'attrice e Illma Gore di essersi finte agenti dell’Fbi per diffondere una lettera contraffatta e ""creare la falsa apparenza"" che le vittime di Manson, e i loro cari, fossero in pericolo, si legge sul Daily Mail.
Secondo l'avvocato di Manson, Howard King, ""lei e l’amica Illma Gore hanno reclutato molte donne e le hanno convinte a confermare accuse false, accuse che sono state sceneggiate da Wood e Gore in persona. HBO e i produttori del documentario erano consapevoli delle loro azioni, ma hanno deciso di procedere comunque. Le prove però sono inconfutabili e questa causa le richiamerà alle loro responsabilità"". Wood e Gore sono, infatti, le protagoniste di Phoenix Rising, il documentario HBO che debutterà il 15 marzo sulla storia dell’attrice con Manson, dal primo incontro.
Il cantante sostiene, inoltre, che le due donne hanno creato un falso indirizzo email allo scopo di simulare un suo invio di materiale pornografico illecito, oltre ad aver messo in scena un finto incidente nella loro casa di Los Angeles. Le accuse sono di diffamazione, hacking della mail, furto d’identità e frode.

The lawsuit claims defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as accusing Wood and Gore of forging a letter from a real FBI agent, and allegedly hacking his phone and several computer accounts to impersonate him online.
Wood began dating Manson in 2007, when she was 18 and he was 36, with the couple getting engaged in 2010.
However, they called off the relationship just seven months later.
The actress has previously spoken out about being in an abusive relationship, but never named the alleged perpetrator publicly before.
Then in February 2021 in an Instagram post, Wood named Manson, saying he ""horrifically abused me for years"".
The rocker was subsequently dropped by his record label, as well as numerous TV projects. Other women came forward with further claims, and police began an investigation.
The legal paper questions why Wood, now 34, waited 10 years to highlight this alleged abuse.
Labelling Gore a ""grifter"", it says she is Wood's on-again, off-again romantic partner.
It also provides checklists and scripts which Manson alleges were used by the women in a conspiracy to ""recruit"" and coach other prospective accusers, sharing them in an appendix at the end of the document.

Marilyn Manson processa Evan Rachel Wood em meio a acusações de estupro,"SÃO PAULO, SP (FOLHAPRESS) – O cantor Marilyn Manson, 53, que recentemente se viu envolvido em uma série de acusações de abuso e estupro, agora resolveu processar a ex-noiva, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, 34. Segundo documento obtido pela People, ele alega que ela e a amiga e artista plástica Illma Gore teriam conspirado para derrubá-lo.
De acordo com uma queixa apresentada na última quarta-feira (3) ao Tribunal Superior de Los Angeles, Manson quer receber um dinheiro ao alegar que teria sido vítima de difamação, sofrimento emocional e falsificação de identidade pela internet.
Segundo a denúncia, o cantor afirma que ambas teriam se passado por agentes do FBI para coagir outras mulheres as fazendo acreditar que suas famílias estavam em risco. E elas teriam pressionado essas pessoas a acusarem Manson de abusos.
A atriz não comenta o caso, e Manson sempre negou qualquer estupro. No processo, o roqueiro se defende e diz que tanto Evan quanto Gore “o lançaram publicamente como um estuprador e abusador. Uma inverdade maliciosa que descarrilou sua carreira de sucesso na música, na TV e no cinema”.
São pelo menos 15 mulheres que o acusaram de agressão sexual. Três delas, incluindo a ex-namorada Ashley Morgan Smithline e a atriz de “Game of Thrones” Esmé Bianco, entraram com ações judiciais.
A atriz acusa Manson de estuprá-la diante das câmeras. O crime teria ocorrido durante as filmagens do videoclipe de “Heart-Shaped Glasses”, de 2007.
Wood, estrela da série de televisão “Westworld”, fez as acusações no documentário “Phoenix Rising”, da HBO. O filme estreou no festival de cinema de Sundance.
“Discutimos uma cena de sexo simulada, mas uma vez que as câmeras começaram a rodar, ele começou a realmente me penetrar”, disse ela. “Eu nunca concordei com isso.”
A ex-atriz mirim começou a namorar Manson, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Warner, em 2006. Na época, ela tinha 18 anos e ele, 37.
“Eu não sabia como me defender e não sabia como dizer não, porque fui condicionada e treinada para nunca responder, apenas para seguir em frente”, disse Wood. “Percebi que a equipe estava muito desconfortável e ninguém sabia o que fazer.”
“Fui forçada a participar de um ato sexual comercial sob falsos pretextos”, continuou. “Fui basicamente estuprada diante das câmeras.”
De acordo com o documentário, Manson mais tarde pressionou Wood a dizer a repórteres que não houve sexo real durante a gravação do vídeo.
Além disso, segundo o jornal britânico Daily Mail, Evan Rachel Wood afirmou em abril de 2021 em papéis judiciais que o músico ameaçou “ferrar” com seu filho, Jack, além de ameaçá-la de morte e afirmar que iria “destruir” as famílias das outras mulheres que o acusam. A atriz afirma ter instalado vidros à prova de balas, uma porta de metal e uma cerca de segurança em sua casa após as ameaças.",2022-03-03T13:20:00Z,https://www.mixvale.com.br,Portal Mix Vale

Nach Missbrauchsvorwürfen: Marilyn Manson verklagt seine Ex,"Jahrelang habe sie Marilyn Manson ""grauenhaft"" missbraucht. Das jedenfalls sagt Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood, die zwischen 2007 und 2010 mit dem Musiker zusammen war. Der Sänger jedoch weist dies zurück - nun auch mit juristischen Mitteln.
Rockmusiker Marilyn Manson hat seine frühere Partnerin, Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood, wegen Verleumdung verklagt. Manson, der mit bürgerlichem Namen Brian Warner heißt, reichte die Klage am Mittwoch in Los Angeles ein.
Auf Instagram verlinkte der 53-Jährige die Dokumente. In einem Statement dazu erklärt er, er könne eines Tages mehr zu den Vorgängen sagen. Vorerst würde er die Fakten sprechen lassen.
In der Klage wirft er Wood und deren Freundin Illma Gore vor, sie hätten ihn öffentlich als Vergewaltiger und Missbrauchstäter dargestellt und auch andere Frauen dazu angestachelt, Vorwürfe gegen ihn zu erheben. Seine Karriere habe dadurch Schaden genommen, macht Manson geltend. Er verlangt Schadenersatz in nicht genannter Höhe.
Polizei ermittelt
Wood hatte ihrem Ex-Freund im Februar 2021 in einem Instagram-Posting jahrelangen ""grauenhaften"" Missbrauch vorgeworfen. Der Sänger hatte dies damals umgehend zurückgewiesen. Seine Kunst und sein Leben seien schon lange ""Magnete für Kontroversen"", aber die Behauptungen über ihn seien ""schreckliche Verfälschungen der Realität"", schrieb er auf Instagram.
Weitere Frauen brachten in den vergangenen Monaten Vorwürfe oder Klagen gegen den 53-jährigen Manson wegen sexueller beziehungsweise physischer Gewalt vor. Die Polizei leitete eine Untersuchung ein. Im vorigen November durchsuchten Beamte das Haus des Musikers in Los Angeles.

La plainte, déposée à Los Angeles, accuse l'actrice et sa «partenaire sentimentale», l'artiste Illma Gore, d'avoir échafaudé des accusations malveillantes contre Marilyn Manson, y compris en se faisant passer pour un agent du FBI pour inciter «des accusatrices potentielles à émerger simultanément avec des allégations de viol et agressions».
Les deux femmes sont accusées d'avoir fourni aux accusatrices «des listes et des scripts» et fait «de fausses déclarations aux accusatrices potentielles» dans le cadre d'un projet qui «pouvait leur bénéficier à toutes deux».
Marilyn Manson demande un procès devant un jury pour mettre fin à ces allégations et évaluer les dommages qui lui sont dus. Ses avocats assurent dans la plainte que Illma Gore a ""piraté"" ses ordinateurs, téléphone, mail et autres comptes sur les réseaux sociaux et qualifient ces action d'""envahissantes, harcelantes, diffamatoires et préjudiciables"".
Marilyn Manson a posté sa plainte sur Twitter en commentant: «le temps viendra où je pourrai partager plus de choses à propos des événements de l'année écoulée. Jusque là, je vais laisser les faits parler pour eux-mêmes».
Evan Rachel Wood avait rendu publiques en janvier ses accusations, démenties par le chanteur, dans le documentaire HBO Phoenix Rising, présenté au festival du film de Sundance et qui doit être diffusé mi-mars.
Elle a accusé le chanteur de l'avoir violée en profitant du tournage en 2007 du clip de Heart-Shaped Glasses, un des succès de Marilyn Manson, alors son compagnon. L'actrice avait commencé à le fréquenter en 2006, elle avait alors 18 ans et lui 37.
Marilyn Manson, aujourd'hui âgé de 53 ans et de son vrai nom Brian Warner, est accusé par plusieurs femmes y compris l'actrice Esmé Bianco (Game of Thrones) de viols et d'autres agressions, ce qu'il nie.
La police de Los Angeles a confirmé l'an dernier avoir ouvert une enquête sur des accusations de violences conjugales contre le chanteur, portant sur des faits commis entre 2009 et 2011.
Marilyn Manson s'est créé un personnage public à l'image inquiétante, d'inspiration gothique, maquillé, portant deux lentilles différentes, avec cheveux de jais.

Manson sostiene anche che Wood e Gore abbiano finto di essere un agente FBI “costruendo e divulgando una lettera fittizia dell’agente allo scopo di creare la falsa apparenza che le presunte vittime di Warner e le loro famiglie fossero in pericolo, e che ci fosse un’indagine in corso su Warner”.",2022-03-03T11:35:54Z,https://tg24.sky.it,Sky Tg24 
Marilyn Manson's Ex-Lover Says Evan Rachel Wood's Accusers Group Tried to Recruit Her,"A former lover of Marilyn Manson has claimed she was approached by his accusers as part of what his lawyer calls an alleged conspiracy to defame the singer, who is battling several sexual assault lawsuits and allegations of abuse.
The musician has launched a robust defense against these allegations of sexual abuse made against him by his ex Evan Rachel Wood and is now suing the Westworld actress for a ""campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks"" she allegedly orchestrated to take him down.

The shock rocker—real name Brian Warner—has, in a new lawsuit, accused Wood, along with her ""on-again, off-again"" partner Ashley ""Illma"" Gore, of defaming him as ""a rapist and abuser—a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV, and film career.""
The singer alleges that Wood and Gore ""provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner.""
Newsweek has reached out to representatives for Wood and contacted Gore for comment.
One woman, who confirmed she had a sexual encounter with the musician in 2011, has said that she was approached by Gore on behalf of Wood to be recruited into this alleged group of accusers.
The woman, who goes by the stage name Greta Aurora, is mentioned in the lawsuit of another of Manson's accusers, Ashley Walters, his former assistant who is suing him for sexual assault, battery and harassment.
Aurora told Newsweek she met Manson in Vienna, Austria, in January 2011, where Manson was attending an art exhibit. Manson was 42-years-old at the time, while Aurora was 19.
""I had a brief sexual relationship with Marilyn Manson in January 2011 while he was visiting Vienna, Austria,"" Aurora said.
""His personal assistant Ashley Walters, who is one of the women suing him, was there with him, and I spent some time talking to her. She asked me to put my number in her phone at one point, so she could text me later that day to let me know when they were going to be back at the hotel where we were staying.
""I believe it was Ashley who passed my details on to Illma Gore. I'm even referred to in Ashley Walters's lawsuit as the sole example of his 'degradation of his female fans.' This is a lie. I wasn't degraded or disrespected in any way.""
Aurora, a model and poet based in England, is cited as an (unnamed) victim of Manson in lines 67 and 68 of Walters' lawsuit against the musician.
Aurora has disputed Walters' account in the lawsuit and believes that Walters is the one who gave Gore her contact info in 2020.
Newsweek has attempted to contact Walters for comment.
Evan Rachel Wood created the nonprofit The Phoenix Act to help survivors of abuse in California and Aurora said she was contacted by Gore on behalf of this initiative on two occasions and believes that she was being recruited into an alleged accusers group formed to defame Manson.
""Illma Gore contacted me on two occasions (first in October 2020 and second in January 2021) in an attempt to get me to attend the Zoom meetings they were organizing at the time to coordinate their allegations against Marilyn Manson,"" Aurora said.
""She used her closeness to Evan Rachel Wood as a bait to get me involved, but I didn't really know who any of these women were at the time, so I ignored the emails. I've attached the screenshots.""
In a screenshot of an email seen by Newsweek, Aurora is contacted by Gore and invited to a ""meet-up"" where a group of people will ""talk about experiences they had similar to yours.""
Manson is not named in either email shared and Gore tells Aurora that she would not be obligated to speak if she were to attend.
In court documents (seen by Newsweek) for the lawsuit against Wood, Manson's legal team wrote that Gore and Wood ""provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner.""
Aurora offered no such ""script"" to Newsweek but Manson's lawyer provided what he says is a script that Gore gave to women who made accusations against Warner.
The image provided by Manson's lawyer to Newsweek is a photo of a sheet of paper with handwritten statements like ""He texted me saying he could rape me"" and ""I woke up tied up being raped"" written on it.
Aurora went on to say that Manson was ""extremely nice"" towards her and that she ""willingly chose to lose [her] virginity to him.""
""He could've done to me anything he wanted to. I'm originally from Hungary, and I didn't speak very good English at the time, let alone German. Naive and young, I would've been the ideal victim for someone with predatory tendencies,"" she said in an email to Newsweek.
She added: ""Yet, he treated me with utmost respect and asked me if I was feeling okay regularly. He always wanted me to confirm I was okay with any intimate acts (which I initiated most of the time). It was all consensual and enjoyable. He also made sure I always had something to eat.""
On Wednesday, March 3, Manson's legal team announced that a lawsuit had been filed against Wood for defamation in the Los Angeles Superior Court.
""This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner. Years after the end of Evan Rachel Wood's long-term relationship with Warner, she and her girlfriend Illma Gore recruited numerous women and convinced them to make false allegations against him—claims that Wood and Gore scripted for them,"" Manson's attorney Howard King told Newsweek.
The lawsuit comes as Wood and Gore are due to appear in a new documentary this month called Phoenix Rising about the actress' life and career that also includes her allegations against Manson.
King added that Wood and Gore ""illegally forged a letter impersonating an actual FBI agent and falsely claiming that she was conducting a criminal investigation of Warner"" and that they allegedly used that ""fabricated FBI letter not only to convince others to join their crusade but also to dupe HBO"" into distributing the documentary.
Manson's legal team has called the documentary ""one-sided"" and ""premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation.""
""Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts,"" said King. ""But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable—and this legal action will hold them to account.""
Newsweek has contacted HBO for comment.",2022-03-03T10:51:23Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
"Marilyn Manson demanda por difamación a su ex, la actriz Evan Rachel Wood, tras decir que la violó","El músico Marilyn Manson demandó este miércoles a su expareja y actriz Evan Rachel Wood por presuntamente difamarle al acusarlo de violación y animar a otras mujeres a presentar denuncias por otros delitos sexuales.
Manson registró esta denuncia en los juzgados de Los Ángeles apenas dos semanas antes de que la plataforma HBO estrene la serie documental Phoenix Rising, en la que la actriz relata su turbulenta relación con el cantante, a quien ha culpado de violarla durante la grabación del videoclip Heart-Shaped Glasses.
El músico, que negó los hechos, ha respondido a esas denuncias con una demanda en la que acusa a Wood y a una colaboradora suya, Ashley Gore, de ""reclutar, coordinar y presionar"" a otras mujeres para que testifiquen contra él.
Según Manson (cuyo nombre real es Brian Warner), las dos mujeres escribieron una carta en la que se hacían pasar por un agente del FBI que estaba investigando al músico.
Dicha misiva habría presionado a los receptores para que demandaran a Manson y además facilitaba un supuesto ""guion"" con una lista de delitos que debían narrar a las autoridades.
Sin embargo, de acuerdo con la cadena NBC, que ha tenido acceso a ese documento, el escrito al que se refiere el músico no incluye el logotipo del FBI y presenta a Wood como ""testigo clave"" de una investigación criminal hacia una ""figura pública muy conocida"".
El documental, que HBO estrenará en dos semanas, repasa las acusaciones contra Manson y sigue la campaña que Wood y Gore llevaron a cabo para que California aprobara una ley que ampliaba las protecciones a las víctimas de delitos sexuales, conocida como 'Phoenix Act'.
Dicha producción se presentó a principios de este año en el Festival de Sundance y acaparó titulares ya que en ella Wood acusa a Manson de violarla ante las cámaras de un rodaje.
""Hablamos de una escena de sexo simulada, pero una vez que las cámaras comenzaron a grabar, comenzó a penetrarme de verdad. Nunca había accedido a eso. Fue un completo caos. No me sentí segura. Nadie cuidaba de mí. Fue una experiencia realmente traumatizante"", explica en la cinta.
Inmediatamente después del pase del documental, el abogado del músico, Howard King, negó las acusaciones.
Pero la revista Rolling Stone publicó un reportaje en el que trabajadores del rodaje aseguraban que llegaron a cancelarlo por las incómodas escenas de sexo y las continuas discusiones entre Manson, los productores y miembros del equipo.
Por su parte, el año pasado la policía de Los Ángeles abrió una investigación contra Manson tras la denuncias de Wood y de otras cuatro mujeres como la estilista Love Bailey, quien dijo en redes sociales: ""Cuando alguien como Marilyn Manson te apunta con una pistola a la cabeza, es hora de hablar"".",2022-03-03T08:16:29Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos

Marilyn Manson processa Evan Rachel Wood em meio a acusações de estupro,"De acordo com uma queixa apresentada na última quarta-feira (3) ao Tribunal Superior de Los Angeles, Manson quer receber um dinheiro ao alegar que teria sido vítima de difamação
O cantor Marilyn Manson, 53, que recentemente se viu envolvido em uma série de acusações de abuso e estupro, agora resolveu processar a ex-noiva, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, 34. Segundo documento obtido pela People, ele alega que ela e a amiga e artista plástica Illma Gore teriam conspirado para derrubá-lo.
De acordo com uma queixa apresentada na última quarta-feira (3) ao Tribunal Superior de Los Angeles, Manson quer receber um dinheiro ao alegar que teria sido vítima de difamação, sofrimento emocional e falsificação de identidade pela internet.
Segundo a denúncia, o cantor afirma que ambas teriam se passado por agentes do FBI para coagir outras mulheres as fazendo acreditar que suas famílias estavam em risco. E elas teriam pressionado essas pessoas a acusarem Manson de abusos.
A atriz não comenta o caso, e Manson sempre negou qualquer estupro. No processo, o roqueiro se defende e diz que tanto Evan quanto Gore “o lançaram publicamente como um estuprador e abusador. Uma inverdade maliciosa que descarrilou sua carreira de sucesso na música, na TV e no cinema”.
São pelo menos 15 mulheres que o acusaram de agressão sexual. Três delas, incluindo a ex-namorada Ashley Morgan Smithline e a atriz de “Game of Thrones” Esmé Bianco, entraram com ações judiciais.
A atriz acusa Manson de estuprá-la diante das câmeras. O crime teria ocorrido durante as filmagens do videoclipe de “Heart-Shaped Glasses”, de 2007.
Wood, estrela da série de televisão “Westworld”, fez as acusações no documentário “Phoenix Rising”, da HBO. O filme estreou no festival de cinema de Sundance.
CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE
“Discutimos uma cena de sexo simulada, mas uma vez que as câmeras começaram a rodar, ele começou a realmente me penetrar”, disse ela. “Eu nunca concordei com isso.”
A ex-atriz mirim começou a namorar Manson, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Warner, em 2006. Na época, ela tinha 18 anos e ele, 37.
“Eu não sabia como me defender e não sabia como dizer não, porque fui condicionada e treinada para nunca responder, apenas para seguir em frente”, disse Wood. “Percebi que a equipe estava muito desconfortável e ninguém sabia o que fazer.”
“Fui forçada a participar de um ato sexual comercial sob falsos pretextos”, continuou. “Fui basicamente estuprada diante das câmeras.”
CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE
De acordo com o documentário, Manson mais tarde pressionou Wood a dizer a repórteres que não houve sexo real durante a gravação do vídeo.
Além disso, segundo o jornal britânico Daily Mail, Evan Rachel Wood afirmou em abril de 2021 em papéis judiciais que o músico ameaçou “ferrar” com seu filho, Jack, além de ameaçá-la de morte e afirmar que iria “destruir” as famílias das outras mulheres que o acusam. A atriz afirma ter instalado vidros à prova de balas, uma porta de metal e uma cerca de segurança em sua casa após as ameaças.",2022-03-03T06:29:00Z,https://jornaldebrasilia.com.br,Jornal de Brasília

Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse allegations,"Rocker Marilyn Manson sued his former fiancee, Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, on Wednesday over her allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship. The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges that Wood’s allegations were fabricated, and that she and another woman named as a defendant, Illma Gore, used false pretenses including a phony letter from the FBI to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say about Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner.

The lawsuit, which claims defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, says Wood publicly cast Manson “as a rapist and abuser — a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career.”
Wood and Gore have not yet filed a response to the lawsuit. An email to representatives of Wood seeking comment was not immediately returned.
Manson and Wood revealed they were a couple in 2007, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.
In 2017, when the #MeToo movement gained momentum, Wood said she had been raped and abused, and she gave testimony to a Congressional committee in 2018, both without naming anyone. Then in an Instagram post in February of 2020, Wood named Manson, saying he “horrifically abused me for years.”
Manson was dropped by his record label. Several other women came forward with similar allegations. At least three of them filed lawsuits. And police began an investigation of Manson.
An HBO documentary on the allegations premieres March 15.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday says that Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship, and she said nothing of his abusing her for 10 years until she met Gore, an artist whom the lawsuit describes as Wood’s on-again, off-again romantic partner.
It alleged that Wood and Gore engaged in a conspiracy that “recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner, and brazenly claim that it took ten or more years to ‘realize’ their consensual relationships with Warner were supposedly abusive.”
The lawsuit says the women impersonated and forged a letter from a real FBI agent to create the false impression that women and their families were in danger from Manson, who was under federal investigation.
It alleges they provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, describing claims to make and how to make them.
Copies of the letter and the lists are included as exhibits in the lawsuit.
It also alleges the women hacked Manson’s email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was emailing illegal pornography, and “swatted” him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home and draw further attention to the allegations.
The lawsuit says that some women who were contacted refused to take part because they were being asked to say things that were untrue.
“This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,” Manson’s attorney Howard King said in a statement.
Wood has not taken legal action against Manson. Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco and Manson’s former assistant Ashley Walters have sued him based on their sexual abuse allegations.

Judge Asks Marilyn Manson Ex-Assistant to Amend Sexual Harassment Suit,"An LA Judge has asked a former Marilyn Manson assistant to submit a new sexual harassment complaint.
Ashley Walters worked as Manson's assistant between 2010-2011 and sued him in May 2021.
On Friday, the judge said that Walters' lawsuit was ""far beyond the two-year limitations' periods.""

A Los Angeles judge asked Ashley Walters, Marilyn Manson's former assistant who sued him over allegations of sexual harassment, to submit an amended complaint on Friday, calling into question the timeline of her allegations.
""Reading the First Amended Complaint as a whole, plaintiff pleads that plaintiff was aware of the actions against her by the time she left her employment,"" Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael L. Stern wrote in his ruling. ""Thus, 9 to 10 years passed until the filing of the action, far beyond the two-year limitations' periods of her claims.""
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael L. Stern asked Walters' team to file an amended complaint by March 11, 2022.
Manson's team had challenged the lawsuit, denying all of the allegations and claiming that they were also past the statute of limitations.
""Moreover, given the salacious nature of the alleged conduct, which plaintiff lays out in great detail to garner as much media attention as possible and to maximize the harm to Warner's reputation, there is simply no way that plaintiff can claim, with any credibility, that she was not aware, until May 2021, that she had grounds to bring claims against Warner,"" Manson's attorneys wrote in their October objection to the suit.
At a January hearing, the judge declined to rule on Manson's challenge, and Walters' team offered supporting arguments for the delayed timeline, alleging that Manson had threatened Walters about speaking out in 2019.
Attorneys representing both parties did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.
Walters, Manson's former assistant, sued the artist over alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, according to court documents.
According to the lawsuit, Walters alleged that Manson forced her to work for two days straight, during which she says she feared Manson's frequent violent and angry outbursts.
Walters accused Manson of pushing her onto his ""influential industry friends and associates,"" including an actor, who forcefully kissed her, in September 2010. She alleged that Manson harassed her by forcefully kissing and groping her and claimed that the musician introduced her to a director that groped her multiple times and put his hand up her skirt while covering her mouth.
""It made me feel like I was his property,"" Walters said. ""It just made me feel like a piece of meat.""
The photographer also claims in the lawsuit that Manson was worried that she would speak publicly about his behavior in 2011, so he spoke poorly of her to his colleagues. In another attempt to dissuade Walters from coming forward, she claimed in the suit that Manson made her pose for pictures wearing Nazi paraphernalia with the intention of using the photos against her if they ever spoke out.
Walters said that after connecting with actress Evan Rachel Wood and other women who alleged that Manson abused them, she felt ready to speak out.",2022-03-03T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER

Evan Rachel Wood,"Marilyn Manson is addressing his defamation lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood hours after filing court documents on Wednesday (March 2). In a brief message posted to his social media account, the shock rocker said that he plans to go into more detail later.
“There will come a time when I can share more about the events of the past year,” he wrote in a text post without a caption. “Until then, I’m going to let the facts speak for themselves.”
He then included a copy of his lawsuit on Twitter, and via a link to it via GoogleDocs on Instagram.
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
The lawsuit alleges that Wood — who named Manson as her abuser in a February 2021 Instagram post — defamed the musician with her accusations of sexual abuse. The lawsuit argues that her “malicious falsehood” was part of an “organized attack” that has damaged his career. Since Wood’s accusation, multiple women have come forward to allege sexual misconduct by Manson, with several filing lawsuits against him. He has denied all accusations.
“This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,” Howard King, Manson’s attorney, told Billboard in a statement after the lawsuit was filed. “The evidence of wrongdoing by Wood … is irrefutable – and this legal action will hold [her] to account.”
Reps for the actress did not respond to Billboard‘s earlier request for comment.
Wednesday’s statement by Manson is his first direct message to fans since Wood accused him of abuse a year ago. His previous statement denied her allegations.
“Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,” he wrote at the time. “My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners.”
Wood is set to be featured in the documentary Phoenix Rising, premiering on HBO in two parts on March 15 and 16. In the film, the Westworld actress offers her account of the abuse she claims she suffered while in a relationship with Manson, to whom she was briefly engaged.

"Após acusações de abuso sexual, Marilyn Manson processa Evan Rachel Wood","Marilyn Manson apresentou uma queixa no Tribunal Superior de Los Angeles nesta quarta-feira (2) contra sua ex-noiva Evan Rachel Wood. O cantor norte-americano acusa a atriz e modelo de difamação, conspiração, falso testemunho e de tentar alavancar a carreira artística com a suposta alegação de que ele teria abusado sexualmente dela.
De acordo com o site Variety, que teve acesso ao processo, o músico diz ainda que a atriz o tachou publicamente como um ""estuprador e abusador"" fazendo com que ele perdesse contratos com gravadoras, além de projetos na televisão e no cinema. ""Uma falsidade maliciosa"", destacou o artista, cujo nome de batismo é Brian Warner.
""Esta ação surge dos atos ilícitos e ilegais feitos em prol de uma conspiração de Evan Rachel Wood e de sua parceira romântica, Ashley Gore, também conhecida como Illma Gore, para lançar publicamente Brian Warner [conhecido como Marilyn Manson], como estuprador e abusador --uma falsidade maliciosa que descarrilou a carreira de sucesso de Warner na música, na TV e no cinema"", diz trecho da queixa apresentada no tribunal, segundo site Deadline.
No processo, o roqueiro faz acusações duras e específicas contra Wood e Gore. Segundo o Deadline, o cantor afirma que a dupla invadiu seus computadores e suas redes sociais, além de ""criar uma conta de email fictícia para fabricar supostas provas"", como pornografia ilícita.
Segundo reportagem da Variety, o artista ainda acusa os dois de se passarem por um ""agente do FBI (a polícia federal americana) no qual teriam forjado e distribuído uma carta fictícia da instituição para criar a falsa aparência de que as supostas vítimas de Manson e suas famílias estavam em perigo e que havia uma investigação criminal contra o cantor em andamento.""
Para Marilyn, Evan e Illma teriam coordenado sistematicamente as alegações dessas mulheres criando até roteiros para que elas seguissem na hora de depor contra ele. Na queixa, o cantor solicitou um julgamento com júri e também alega que houve violação da Lei de Fraude de Acesso e Dados de Computador Abrangentes e falsificação de identidade pela Internet.
Em 23 de janeiro de 2022, Evan Rachel Wood acusou Marilyn Manson de estuprá-la diante de câmeras no estúdio de filmagens do clipe Heart-Shaped Glasses, em 2007. A nova declaração aparece no documentário Phoenix Rising, que aborda a vida e a carreira da atriz e modelo, com estreia prevista para 15 de março no canal HBO e na plataforma HBO Max.
""Tínhamos discutido uma cena de sexo simulada, mas, assim que as câmeras começaram a rodar, ele começou a me penetrar de verdade. Eu nunca tinha concordado com isso"", recorda Evan no documentário, cuja primeira parte foi exibida no Festival de Sundance no mesmo dia.
De acordo com The Guardian, Evan e Manson começaram a namorar em 2006, quando ela tinha 18 anos, e ele, 38. Os dois tiveram um namoro ioiô por quatro anos. A gravação do clipe aconteceu em 2007. Na época, sites americanos levantaram o debate se o cantor estaria apenas encenando ou realmente fazendo sexo com a modelo.
""Sou uma atriz profissional. Tenho feito isso toda a minha vida. Nunca estive em um set tão pouco profissional. Era um caos completo, e eu não me sentia segura. Ninguém estava cuidando de mim. Foi uma experiência realmente traumatizante filmar o vídeo"", prossegue Evan no documentário da diretora Amy Berg.
""Não sabia como me defender ou dizer não porque eu tinha sido condicionada e treinada para nunca responder --para simplesmente seguir em frente. Eu me senti nojenta como se tivesse feito algo vergonhoso, e percebi que a equipe estava muito desconfortável e ninguém sabia o que fazer. Fui coagida a um ato sexual comercial sob falsos pretextos. Foi quando o primeiro crime foi cometido contra mim, e eu fui essencialmente estuprada diante das câmeras. ""
Dias depois, o advogado de Marilyn Manson, Howard King, negou as alegações de que o cantor teria estuprado Evan Rachel Wood diante de câmeras no estúdio de filmagens do clipe Heart-Shaped Glasses. Ele afirmou que a atriz sabe da verdade e que havia várias testemunhas no local para comprovar.
""De todas as falsas alegações que Evan Rachel Wood fez sobre Brian Warner [nome verdadeiro de Marilyn Mason], sua releitura imaginativa da produção do videoclipe de 'Heart-Shaped Glasses', há 15 anos, é a mais descarada e fácil de refutar, porque havia várias testemunhas"", disse King ao jornal The Guardian.
""Evan não estava apenas engajada durante os três dias de filmagem, mas também fortemente envolvida em semanas de planejamento de pré-produção e dias de edição de pós-produção do corte final. A cena de sexo simulada levou várias horas para ser filmada com várias tomadas, usando diferentes ângulos e várias pausas longas entre as configurações da câmera"", complementou o advogado do artista.
Escândalo estourou no ano passado
Em 2010, Manson pediu a mão dela em casamento durante um show em Paris. No mesmo ano, o relacionamento terminou. Em fevereiro de 2021, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood fez as primeiras acusações de abuso e violência doméstica contra o ex-noivo.
""O nome do meu abusador é Brian Warner, também conhecido mundialmente como Marilyn Manson. Ele começou a me assediar quando eu ainda era uma adolescente e abusou terrivelmente de mim por anos"", escreveu a atriz em seu perfil no Instagram à época.
""Passei por uma lavagem cerebral, fui manipulada para ser submissa. Estou cansada de viver com medo de retaliação, difamação ou chantagem. Estou aqui para expor esse homem perigoso e avisar a todas as indústrias que o apoiam, antes que ele destrua mais vidas. Estou ao lado das muitas vítimas que não vão mais ficar em silêncio"", completou.
Uma das primeiras manifestações da atriz foi em 2016 em uma entrevista à revista Rolling Stone e uma carta aberta publicada em seu perfil no Twitter. À época, contudo, ela revelou as situações de abuso, mas sem citar o nome de Manson.
Evan Rachel Wood está entre várias mulheres, incluindo a atriz de Game of Thrones Esmé Bianco, que acusa Manson de agressão sexual, abuso psicológico, violência ou intimidação. Segundo The Guardian, Manson negou as acusações feitas contra ele, chamando-as de ""horríveis distorções da realidade"". Ele disse que seus ""relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram inteiramente consensuais"".",2022-03-03T02:16:00Z,https://noticiasdatv.uol.com.br,Notícias da TV
"Marilyn Manson Sues Evan Rachel Wood for Documentary, but Not Director, HBO","Rock star Marilyn Manson has filed a defamation lawsuit against actress Evan Rachel Wood for accusing him of sexual abuse, although he did not sue the director of an upcoming HBO documentary that details the allegations.
Wood and other women accuse the shock rocker, whose real name is Brian Warner, of multiple instances of sexual assault in the documentary Phoenix Rising, which is set to air on HBO on March 15. According to a complaint obtained by Newsweek and filed in court on Tuesday, attorneys for Manson wrote that his portrayal as a ""rapist and abuser"" was ""a malicious falsehood that has derailed [his] successful music, TV, and film career.""
Neither HBO nor Phoenix Rising director Amy Berg were named in the lawsuit. The suit alleges that Wood and ""her on-again, off-again romantic partner"" Ashley Gore ""secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner."" They were also accused of circulating a letter that impersonated an FBI agent while falsely claiming that a federal investigation was underway.
In addition, Gore is accused of ""swatting"" Manson by calling the FBI and claiming to be a ""friend"" who was concerned that there was an ""emergency"" at his house. The suit claims that Manson and Gore had never met and that the call resulted in a large number of police officers being sent to his home, where there was no emergency.
""This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,"" Manson's attorney Howard King said in a statement obtained by Newsweek. ""As part of their plot, Wood and Gore illegally forged a letter impersonating an actual FBI agent and falsely claiming that she was conducting a criminal investigation of Warner.""
King said that the letter was used to ""convince others to join their crusade"" as well as ""to dupe HBO into distributing a one-sided 'documentary' premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation.""
""Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts,"" he said.
King told Deadline that HBO and Berg were not sued because they were ""also victims of Wood and Gore"" and had been coerced into ""making a documentary based on false claims and fraudulent documents.""
Wood and Manson met in 2006, when she was 18 and he was 38. They ended their relationship not long after getting engaged in 2010. Last February, Wood alleged Manson had ""horrifically abused"" her for years and began ""grooming"" her when she was a teenager. Manson has denied the allegations on multiple occasions.
The HBO documentary focuses on the allegations against Manson as well as the Phoenix Act, a nonprofit organization that Wood founded to help victims of abuse and lobby for laws that would extend the statute of limitations to file charges over abuse accusations.

(AP) – Rocker Marilyn Manson sued his former fiancée, “Westworld” actor Evan Rachel Wood, on Wednesday over her allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship.
The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges that Wood’s allegations were fabricated, and that she and another woman named as a defendant, Illma Gore, used false pretenses including a phony letter from the FBI to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say about Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner.
The lawsuit, which claims defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, says Wood publicly cast Manson “as a rapist and abuser — a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career.”
Wood and Gore have not yet filed a response to the lawsuit. An email to representatives of Wood seeking comment was not immediately returned.
Manson and Wood revealed they were a couple in 2007, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.

It alleged that Wood and Gore engaged in a conspiracy that “recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner, and brazenly claim that it took ten or more years to ‘realize’ their consensual relationships with Warner were supposedly abusive.”
The lawsuit says the women impersonated and forged a letter from a real FBI agent to create the false impression that women and their families were in danger from Manson, who was under federal investigation.
It alleges they provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, describing claims to make and how to make them.
Copies of the letter and the lists are included as exhibits in the lawsuit.
It also alleges the women hacked Manson’s email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was emailing illegal pornography, and “swatted” him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home and draw further attention to the allegations.

Marilyn Manson Sues Evan Rachel Wood for Defamation Over Alleged Abuse,"Watch : Marilyn Manson Speaks Out After Abuse Allegations
Content warning: This story discusses sexual assault and rape.
After being publicly accused of abuse in February 2021, musician Marilyn Manson is taking his ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood to court for defamation, according to court documents obtained by E! News on March 2.
Manson (real name Brian Warner) filed a complaint in the Los Angeles Supreme Court against the Westworld actress and her alleged ""on-again, off-again romantic partner"" Ashley Gore. He is seeking compensation for damages and an injunction preventing ""future wrongful conduct.""
The lawsuit states that Wood and Gore ""publicly cast"" Manson ""as a rapist and abuser,"" calling it ""a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV, and film career.""
E! News has reached out to Gore and to Wood's rep for comment and has not heard back.
In the lawsuit, which asks for a trial by jury, Manson alleges that Wood—whom he dated from 2006 to 2010—committed multiple offences with Gore including impersonating an FBI agent and recruiting and pressuring others to share false accusations about him.
It also states that Gore slandered Warner, created fictitious email accounts under his name, ""swatted"" him in February 2021 and hacked his computer files and social media accounts.",2022-03-03T01:32:02Z,https://www.eonline.com,E! NEWS
Marilyn Manson klaagt ex-vriendin Evan Rachel Wood aan,"Marilyn Manson (53) heeft zijn voormalig geliefde Evan Rachel Wood (34) aangeklaagd, omdat de zanger meent dat Wood hem door de documentaire die ze over hem heeft gemaakt hem in een kwaad daglicht wil stellen. Manson, wiens echte naam Brian Hugh Warner is, is van mening dat Wood haar vriendin Illma Gore, met wie ze een 'aan-uit' relatie had, heeft opgestookt tegen hem om verhalen over verkrachtingen de wereld in te brengen, om daar uiteindelijk zelf financieel beter van te worden. Dit meldt Page Six.
Volgens de advocaten van de excentrieke zanger heeft Wood nooit aangifte gedaan van seksueel misbruik of seksueel ontoelaatbaar gedrag toen ze een relatie met Manson had. De twee waren samen tussen 2006 en 2010, en ook in de jaren nadat ze uit elkaar waren is er nooit iets gemeld door Wood, zeggen Mansons advocaten. En dat noemen zij 'vreemd', omdat Wood zich pas vocaal liet gelden sinds het moment dat Gore in haar leven kwam.
""Illma Gore is simpelweg een profiteur, een parasiet, hoe je het ook wilt noemen. Zij is er altijd op uit geweest om Warner, beter bekend als Marilyn Manson, kapot te maken. Het is triest dat zijn reputatie nu kapot gemaakt wordt door vrouwen die alleen maar van hem hebben geprofiteerd en nu ineens doen alsof ze het slachtoffer zijn. Wood en Gore hebben maandenlang de tijd gehad om hun verhalen op elkaar af te stemmen en dat is iets waar tegen onze cliënt zich niet kan verdedigen. Het is hun verhaal tegen het zijne, maar geloof ons: hij spreekt de waarheid. En dat heeft hij altijd gedaan.""

Marilyn Manson Sues Evan Rachel Wood For Defamation Amid Sexual Assault Allegations: Report,"For years, Marilyn Manson has faced accusations of sexual assault and violence, but his legal troubles have intensified after ex-girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood began working on a documentary about her alleged interactions with the rock star. Manson is also facing lawsuits from Game of Thrones actress Esmé Blanco and a former assistant, but Wood's Phoenix Rising documentary where she chronicles her alleged abusive relationship with Manson amplified the visibility of this case.
Manson has remained relatively silent until this week when he announced his lawsuit against Wood, citing defamation and impersonation of an FBI agent.

“We’re filing this now because we have been able to gather an overwhelming trove of evidence – including both documents and witness statements – which proves that the stories that Evan Rachel Wood and her co-conspirator Illma Gore have been falsifying and spreading are both vindictive and demonstrably untrue,” Manson’s attorney Howard King told Deadline.
“It’s incredibly important to differentiate between the character of ‘Marilyn Manson’ and the man Brian Warner,” he continued. “Wood’s claims may resonate because of the intentionally ‘shocking’ character of ‘Marilyn Manson’ but they simply do not reflect the truth. The manufactured facts these conspirators scripted a decade after the event never happened.”
On his Instagram, Manson left this message: ""There will come a time when I can share more about the events of the past year. Until then, I'm going to let the facts speak for themselves."" He advised viewers to click the link in his Instagram bio which directs them to a PDF of the lawsuit.
Manson is not only suing Wood but a woman named Ashley Gore as well, and he alleges that Gore is Wood's on-again-off-again romantic partner. He claims the women hacked his social media accounts and computers, and “created a fictitious email account to manufacture purported evidence that [Manson] was emailing illicit pornography.”

Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood over abuse allegations,"Rocker Marilyn Manson sued his former fiancee, “Westworld"" actor Evan Rachel Wood, on Wednesday over her allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship.
The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges that Wood's allegations were fabricated, and that she and another woman named as a defendant, Illma Gore, used false pretenses including a phony letter from the FBI to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations and coached them on what to say about Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner.
The lawsuit, which claims defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, says Wood publicly cast Manson “as a rapist and abuser — a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career.”
Wood and Gore have not yet filed a response to the lawsuit. An email to representatives of Wood seeking comment was not immediately returned.
Manson and Wood revealed they were a couple in 2007, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.
In 2017, when the #MeToo movement gained momentum, Wood said she had been raped and abused, and she gave testimony to a Congressional committee in 2018, both without naming anyone. Then in an Instagram post in February of 2020, Wood named Manson, saying he “horrifically abused me for years.”
Manson was dropped by his record label. Several other women came forward with similar allegations. At least three of them filed lawsuits. And police began an investigation of Manson.
An HBO documentary on the allegations premieres March 15.
The lawsuit filed Wednesday says that Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship, and she said nothing of his abusing her for 10 years until she met Gore, an artist whom the lawsuit describes as Wood’s on-again, off-again romantic partner.
It alleged that Wood and Gore engaged in a conspiracy that “recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner, and brazenly claim that it took ten or more years to 'realize' their consensual relationships with Warner were supposedly abusive.”
The lawsuit says the women impersonated and forged a letter from a real FBI agent to create the false impression that women and their families were in danger from Manson, who was under federal investigation.
It alleges they provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, describing claims to make and how to make them.
Copies of the letter and the lists are included as exhibits in the lawsuit.
It also alleges the women hacked Manson's email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was emailing illegal pornography, and “swatted” him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home and draw further attention to the allegations.
The lawsuit says that some women who were contacted refused to take part because they were being asked to say things that were untrue.
“This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,"" Manson's attorney Howard King said in a statement.
Wood has not taken legal action against Manson. “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco and Manson's former assistant Ashley Walters have sued him based on their sexual abuse allegations.

Marilyn Manson files defamation lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood over rape and abuse allegations against him,"Marilyn Manson is suing former girlfriend and actor Evan Rachel Wood in connection to her allegations that he raped and abused her over the course of their relationship less than two weeks before Wood is set to star in an HBO documentary.
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, filed a defamation suit against Wood and another woman in Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday, accusing them of having “secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers.” The lawsuit also names Ashley Gore, who worked with Wood as part of the actor’s push to pass the legislation for abuse victims.
Neither Wood nor Gore immediately responded to a request for comment from NBC News.
His suit, which asks for a jury trial, accuses Wood and Gore of intentional infliction of emotional distress. He accused Gore of defamation, impersonation over the internet and violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data and Access Fraud Act.
Wood testified before a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on sexual abuse in 2018 that she had been raped two times, first by an abusive partner and then by a man in the storage closet of a bar. At the time, she had not named her alleged abusers.
But Wood accused Manson of “grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years” in an Instagram post last year.
Manson addressed Wood’s allegations in an Instagram post that February, stating that his art and his life “have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.”
“My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners,” he said. “Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”
Manson alleges that Wood and Gore conspired for months prior to her post to coordinate allegations as part of a documentary, “Phoenix Rising,” which is set to release on HBO on March 15.
“That same day, several other women, assisted and coordinated by Wood and/or Gore, sought media attention with remarkably similar public abuse allegations against Warner,” the lawsuit said. “Those claims, like Wood’s, were false.”
Manson has not been charged with any crime connected to Wood’s allegations.
Howard King, the lawyer representing Manson, alleged in a statement and in the lawsuit filing that the women forged a letter impersonating an actual FBI agent who claimed to be investigating Manson. He accused Wood and Gore of using the letter to recruit other women into making allegations and to convince HBO into publishing their documentary.
The alleged letter is attached in the lawsuit filing and has been seen by NBC News. It does not have an FBI logo and states that Wood is a key witness in a criminal investigation involving a “well known public figure” but does not name Manson. Though the copy of the letter is redacted, it appears to have been signed by someone in the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.
The FBI and district attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter or an investigation into Manson.
“Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts,” King said. “But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable — and this legal action will hold them to account.”
HBO declined to comment on the filing to NBC News.
The lawsuit also alleges that Gore contacted prospective women by stating that she worked with Wood as part of her domestic abuse advocacy and was organizing a meeting for a group of women who might have had similar experiences. She then sent women a “checklist” of abusive acts to ensure all the allegations were coordinated, the lawsuit said.
Manson also accused Gore of hacking his social media and email accounts to gain access to personal information and private conversations. The lawsuit alleges that she slandered him to the women she spoke with to “orchestrate and amplify false accusations against Warner, thereby bolstering Wood’s claim that Warner had been her (and others’) abuser.”
Manson’s home was searched and police took “media storage devices” in November as part of a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department investigation into allegations of domestic abuse and assault, NBC Los Angeles reported at the time. The sheriff’s department and the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to inquiries about the status of the investigation.
A lawsuit filed against Manson by a woman, who remained anonymous, was dismissed by a judge last year after it was determined the statute of limitations had expired on the allegations. He still faces lawsuits from three other women.
“Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco filed a lawsuit in April against Manson, alleging he committed multiple violent sexual assaults, a rape and other abuse from 2009 to 2013.
In May, his then-assistant Ashley Walters accused the goth singer of sexual exploitation and psychological abuse. A judge ordered Walters to amend her filing last week in response to a request from Manson’s attorneys to dismiss the case based on statute of limitations.
And in June, model Ashley Morgan Smithline sued Manson for sexual assault, sexual battery and human trafficking.

Marilyn Manson files defamation lawsuit against ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood over sex abuse allegations,"Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against his ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood, alleging that she and her partner defamed him in order to destroy his career.
The shock-rock artist (53) claims that actor Wood (34) and artist Illma Gore made sexual abuse allegations against him for profit, in addition to hacking his social media accounts and computers.
Manson, real name Brian Warner, filed his complaint to the Los Angeles Superior Court and is seeking a jury trial, US media reports.
The complaint reads: “This action arises from the wrongful and illegal acts done in furtherance of a conspiracy by Defendant Evan Rachel Wood and her on-again, off-again romantic partner, Defendant Ashley Gore, a/k/a Illma Gore, to publicly cast Plaintiff Brian Warner, p/k/a Marilyn Manson, as a rapist and abuser – a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career.”
The Westworld actor has accused Manson of sexually, physically and emotionally abusing her over the course of their relationship.
In Wood’s forthcoming documentary, Phoenix Rising, she alleges that Manson “essentially raped” her while filming the music video for his 2007 single “Heart-Shaped Glasses”.
Manson’s lawyer, Howard King, said in January: “Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the ‘Heart-Shaped Glasses’ music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses.
“Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.”
Wood met Warner in 2005, when she was 18 and Manson was 38. They became engaged in 2010 but called off their relationship a few months later.
Further in the complaint, King describes Gore as “a grifter who understood that an organised attack on Warner — spearheaded by Wood’s own fabricated revelation of rape and abuse – could benefit them both”.
Video of the Day
“With Gore’s help, Wood could be rebranded, from someone who ‘still might best be known for dating Marilyn Manson a decade ago’, into an outspoken standard bearer for victims of domestic violence or sexual assault — thereby absolving her reputation for having a ‘wild past’ and her embarrassment for having been in a long-term relationship with Marilyn Manson,” he said.
King also alleges that Wood and Gore “secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse” for profit.
Wood’s and Gore’s representatives have been contacted for comment.
Investigations into allegations Manson began last year, after the LA County Sheriff’s Department received reports of domestic violence and sexual assault between 2009 and 2011.
In November 2021, officers searched Manson’s home and seized media storage devices, among other items.",2022-03-03T00:00:00Z,https://www.independent.ie,Independent.ie
Marilyn Manson sues Evan Rachel Wood for defamation over abuse claims,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)
Marilyn Manson is suing ex-girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood.
The singer (real name: Brian Hugh Warner) alleges in a new lawsuit filed on Wednesday that Wood conspired with her on-again, off-again girlfriend, Illma Gore, to defame him with rape allegations for their own monetary gain.
In the complaint obtained by Page Six, Manson, 53, claims Wood, 34, is guilty of intentionally inflicting emotional distress, defamation, impersonation and violating the Computer Data and Access Fraud Act.
Manson’s attorneys claim Wood never accused their client of abuse while they were together from 2006 to 2010 – or in the 10 years since they split – “until she met Gore,” whom they allege is a “grifter who understood that an organized attack on Warner — spearheaded by Wood’s own fabricated revelation of rape and abuse — could benefit them both.”
They claim Wood’s motivation for accusing Manson of abuse was to “absolve her reputation” for having a “wild past.”
In February 2021, Wood dropped a bombshell claim via Instagram and in a statement to Vanity Fair, alleging that Manson “started grooming” her when she was a teenager and “horrifically abused” her for years.

Manson’s attorneys allege in the new complaint that Wood’s social media post came after “months of conspiring with Gore on how to use Wood’s celebrity status to recruit other women and coordinate their ‘stories.'”
They claim that by the time Wood spoke out publicly, HBO had already signed on to work with her and Gore on a documentary in the summer of 2020.
The two-part doc, titled “Phoenix Rising,” is set to premiere on the network in March 2022. According to Deadline, it chronicles how Wood “takes her alleged experience as a survivor of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse by rock icon Marilyn Manson into her own hands to pursue justice, heal generational wounds, and reclaim her story.”
“Wood and Gore have derailed Warner’s career,” Manson’s attorneys allege in the complaint, adding that the two women have allegedly used their film project to “recruit,
coordinate, and pressure women who had been linked to Warner to make false accusations of abuse against him.”
At least 15 women — including actress Esmé Bianco — have accused “The Dope Show” singer of various levels of sexual, psychological and physical abuse.
An attorney for Manson told Page Six in April that Bianco’s allegations “are provably false.” Manson’s legal team has also denied all accusations of sexual assault. The singer has not been charged with any crime connected to the alleged incidents.
A sexual abuse lawsuit filed by Jane Doe was dismissed in September 2021 because it was past the statute of limitations.
Manson’s attorneys claim in the complaint that Gore convinced prospective accusers that their “failures to allege of abuse over the past 10 plus years was not
because no abuse occurred, but instead because abuse caused people to ‘repress’ their memories.”
They also allege that Gore and Wood once impersonated an FBI agent and created a “fictitious letter” stating the “Barefoot” star’s safety was in question. A text of the alleged efforts of Wood and Gore to come up with the script of the letter was submitted as evidence.
A screenshot of the text Woods allegedly sent Gore under the nickname “Alabama,” according to Manson’s lawyers. Marilyn Manson legal complaint
“Wood submitted the forged letter in a California custody proceeding, using it as supposed evidence for why she should be able to move her son to Tennessee,” the complaint states. “Citing and quoting from the letter, Wood lied under penalty of perjury.”
Additionally, Manson’s lawyers claim that Wood and Gore were guilty of “swatting,” a term used when law enforcement is wrongfully dispatched to a person’s home as a result of a hoax or a prank.
Cops swarmed the “Sweet Dreams” singer’s house in February 2021 following claims that someone was screaming that they “wanted to leave.”
The attorneys also accuse Wood and Gore of soliciting and receiving Manson’s logins and passwords for his personal, business, social media and email accounts without his permission.
“This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,” one of Manson’s attorneys, Howard King, told Page Six on Wednesday.
“Years after the end of Evan Rachel Wood’s long-term relationship with Warner, she and her girlfriend Illma Gore recruited numerous women and convinced them to make false allegations against him – claims that Wood and Gore scripted for them.”
Manson has denied all allegations of abuse via his attorneys. Kurt Krieger – Corbis
King also claimed Wood and Gore used the “fabricated FBI letter” to “convince others to join their crusade” and “dupe HBO into distributing a one-sided ‘documentary’ premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation.”
“Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts,” the attorney concluded. “But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable – and this legal action will hold them to account.”

Marilyn Manson files defamation suit against sexual abuse accuser Evan Rachel Wood,"Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against Evan Rachel Wood for defamation over the actor’s sexual abuse allegations against him.
Manson, the American “shock rocker” born Brian Warner, filed the complaint in Los Angeles superior court on Wednesday. The complaint accuses Wood and her “on-again, off-again” partner Ashley “Illma” Gore, of depicting him as “a rapist and abuser – a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career.”
Representatives for Wood and Gore did not respond to request for comment from Deadline, which first reported the lawsuit.
Wood and Gore appear in Phoenix Rising, a new documentary about Wood’s life and career that is scheduled to premiere on HBO this month. It also details Wood’s allegations against Manson.
In the documentary, Wood said that during a previously discussed “simulated sex scene” for the music video of Manson’s 2007 single Heart-Shaped Glasses, Manson “started penetrating me for real” and that she “had never agreed to that”.
Wood said she was given absinthe on set, which affected her ability to refuse Manson’s alleged actions. Warner has denied raping Wood on the set of the music video.
In Wednesday’s filing, Manson accused Wood and Gore of “falsifying and spreading” allegations against him. He claims they pretended to be an FBI agent by “forging and distributing a fictitious letter from the agent, to create the false appearance” that Manson was under a federal criminal investigation.
Manson alleges that Wood and Gore “provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner”.
The suit accuses Gore of trying to obtain Manson’s login information to his computer, phone and email and claims that she created a fake email address to claim that Manson was sending pornography to contacts.
In addition to requesting a jury trial, Manson has accused Wood of inflicting emotional distress, violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data and Access Fraud Act, and impersonation over the internet.
In a statement, Howard King, Manson’s attorney said: “Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts.

The lawsuit says the women impersonated and forged a letter from a real FBI agent to create the false impression that women and their families were in danger from Manson, who was under federal investigation.
It alleges they provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, describing claims to make and how to make them.
Copies of the letter and the lists are included as exhibits in the lawsuit.
It also alleges the women hacked Manson's email, phone and social media accounts, created a phony email to manufacture evidence that he was emailing illegal pornography, and “swatted” him, using a prank call to send authorities to his home and draw further attention to the allegations.
The lawsuit says that some women who were contacted refused to take part because they were being asked to say things that were untrue.
“This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,"" Manson's attorney Howard King said in a statement.
Wood has not taken legal action against Manson. “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco and Manson's former assistant Ashley Walters have sued him based on their sexual abuse allegations.
The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly.

Evan Rachel Wood,"Marilyn Manson is suing Evan Rachel Wood for defamation over her accusations of sexual abuse against him, arguing that her “malicious falsehood” was part of an “organized attack” that has derailed his career.
In a lawsuit filed Wednesday (March 2) in Los Angeles court, Manson claimed that ex-fiancee Wood had conspired with a woman named Ashley Gore — who both appear in the upcoming documentary Phoenix Rising — to falsely cast the rocker as a “rapist and abuser.” Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, said the alleged scheme explains why he has faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct over the past year.

“Gore and Wood have secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner, and brazenly claim that it took 10 or more years to ‘realize’ their consensual relationships with Warner were supposedly abusive,” Manson wrote.
Reps for Wood did not immediately return a request for comment.
Manson has faced multiple accusations of wrongdoing over the past year. Ashley Walters, a former assistant, sued him in May, and model Ashley Morgan Smithline filed her own case in June. Game of Thrones actress Esme Bianco and a Jane Doe accuser have also filed lawsuits. Manson has denied all allegations.
Wood, who began publicly dating Manson in 2007 when she was 19 and he was 39, was one of the first to make such accusations, beginning with a February 2021 Instagram post, claiming that the rocker had “started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years.” She claimed she was “brainwashed and manipulated into submission” and had stayed silent because of fear of retaliation.
In his new lawsuit, Manson claimed that Wood had never accused him of wrongdoing until she met Gore (also known as Illma Gore), whom he called “a grifter” who helped Wood “rebrand” as “an outspoken standard bearer for victims of domestic violence or sexual assault.”
To further their conspiracy, Manson claimed in the filing, the pair impersonated an FBI agent, provided scripts to “prospective accusers,” solicited his private information from former employees, and created a fake email address to manufacture evidence that he had sent illicit pornography.
In a statement to Billboard, Manson’s attorney Howard King said the suit was necessary “to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner.” The lawyer’s statement also alleged the Wood and Gore used the “fabricated FBI letter” to “dupe” HBO into distributing the “one-sided” Phoenix Rising.
Concluded King, “The evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable – and this legal action will hold them to account.”",2022-03-02T20:53:46Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

Marilyn Manson saksøker eks-forloveden
Goth-rockeren mener beskyldningene fra Evan Rachel Wood er ondskapsfulle usannheter og har ødelagt karrieren hans.
Av Stein Østbø
Publisert: For mindre enn 50 minutter siden
Det er Deadline som melder dette. Søksmålet ble innlevert Los Angeles Superior Court onsdag morgen amerikansk tid, ifølge nettstedet.
Marilyn Manson, eller Brian Warner som er hans opprinnelige navn, har i lengre tid måttet tåle harde angrep og beskyldninger om mishandling overfor blant andre sin egen eks-forlovede Evan Rachel Wood og artisten/kunstneren Illma Gore.
Begge to er omfattet av søksmålet, der det heter:

«Denne handlingen har sitt utspring i de ukorrekte og ulovlige handlingene i kjølvannet av konspirasjonen fra Evan Rachel Wood og hennes av og på-romantiske partner, Ashley Gore - aka Illma Gore - som offentlig har stemplet Brian Warner som en voldtektsmann og mishandler - en ondskapsfull uriktighet som har fått Warners suksessrike karriere innen musikk, tv og film til å spore av».

Det var i februar i fjor at Wood navnga Marilyn Manson som personen som hun hevdet hadde mishandlet henne, psykisk og seksuelt, i en årrekke.
«Jeg ble hjernevasket og manipulert til underkastelse», skrev hun i sitt Instagram-innlegg.
Senere fikk hun følge av flere kvinner som hevdet å ha opplevd det samme med rockeren. «Game of Thrones»-stjernen Esmé Bianco gikk i etterkant til søksmål mot Manson.
Beskyldningene fra eks-forloveden og de andre kvinnene gjorde at Mansons karriere fikk en bråstopp. Han ble persona non grata både hos sitt eget plateselskap og hos tv- og filmselskapene han jobbet med.
Marilyn Manson har hele veien nektet for beskyldningene og har kalt dem «en uhyrlig forvrengelse av virkeligheten».

Marilyn Manson Sues Evan Rachel Wood for Defamation,"Marilyn Manson is suing Evan Rachel Wood for defamation, Deadline reports and Pitchfork can confirm. In addition to Wood, the lawsuit names Illma Gore (described as Wood’s “on-again, off-again romantic partner”) as a defendant. Manson is seeking a jury trial, according to the complaint, filed in a California court by Manson’s attorney Howard E. King.
The lawsuit claims that Wood and Gore committed “wrongful and illegal acts done in furtherance of a conspiracy… to publicly cast Plaintiff Brian Warner, p/k/a Marilyn Manson, as a rapist and abuser—a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career.”
In the lawsuit, Manson and King claim that Wood and Gore “secretly recruited, coordinated, and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner.” In addition the lawsuit states, “They provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner.”
In addition, Manson and his lawyer say that Wood and Gore impersonated an FBI agent “to create the false appearance that Warner’s alleged ‘victims’ and their families were in danger, and that there was a federal criminal investigation of Warner ongoing.”
In a statement shared with Pitchfork, King said, “This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner. Years after the end of Evan Rachel Wood’s long-term relationship with Warner, she and her girlfriend Illma Gore recruited numerous women and convinced them to make false allegations against him—claims that Wood and Gore scripted for them.”
Pitchfork has reached out to Evan Rachel Wood and Illma Gore’s respective representatives for comment and additional information.
Evan Rachel Wood publicly named Manson as her alleged abuser for the first time last year. (The actor, who was briefly engaged to Manson in 2010, had previously spoken about surviving domestic abuse but declined to name the alleged perpetrator.) Her disclosure led to several women speaking up about alleged abuse they experienced from Manson. In addition, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department investigated domestic violence claims against the musician. Manson was also dropped from his record label, Loma Vista, and pulled from scenes of the TV shows American Gods and Creepshow.
Wood is the subject of director Amy Berg’s new documentary Phoenix Rising. In the film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, Wood alleges that Manson “essentially raped” her during the filming of the music video for Manson’s 2007 single “Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand).” The documentary airs on HBO later this month.

Marilyn Manson sues ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood over her claims of sexual abuse,"File Footage
Rocker Marilyn Manson sued his former fiancée, Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, on Wednesday over her allegations that he sexually and physically abused her during their relationship, reported The Associated Press.
The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges that Wood’s allegations were fabricated, and that she and another woman named as a defendant, Illma Gore, used false pretences including a phony letter from the FBI to convince other women to come forward with sexual abuse allegations.
It also alleges that Wood coached them on what to say about Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner.
The lawsuit, which claims defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, says Wood publicly cast Manson “as a rapist and abuser — a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career.”
Wood and Gore have not yet filed a response to the lawsuit. An email to representatives of Wood seeking comment was not immediately returned.
Manson and Wood revealed they were a couple in 2007, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.
In 2017, when the #MeToo movement gained momentum, Wood said she had been raped and abused, and she gave testimony to a Congressional committee in 2018, both without naming anyone.
Then in an Instagram post in February of 2020, Wood named Manson, saying he “horrifically abused me for years.”
Manson was dropped by his record label. Several other women came forward with similar allegations. At least three of them filed lawsuits and police began an investigation of Manson.
The lawsuit filed Wednesday says that Wood had only glowing things to say about Manson during their relationship, and she said nothing of his abusing her for 10 years until she met Gore, an artist whom the lawsuit describes as Wood’s on-again, off-again romantic partner.
The lawsuit says the women impersonated and forged a letter from a real FBI agent to create the false impression that women and their families were in danger from Manson, who was under federal investigation.
It alleges they provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, describing claims to make and how to make them.
Copies of the letter and the lists are included as exhibits in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit says that some women who were contacted refused to take part because they were being asked to say things that were untrue.
“This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,” Manson’s attorney Howard King said in a statement.

Marilyn Manson Sues Evan Rachel Wood Over Alleged Abuse Claims,"EXCLUSIVE: Marilyn Manson is now taking ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood to court over her allegations of abuse during the widely accused shock rocker and the Westworld actress’ relationship.
“This action arises from the wrongful and illegal acts done in furtherance of a conspiracy by Defendant Evan Rachel Wood and her on-again, off-again romantic partner, Defendant Ashley Gore, a/k/a Illma Gore, to publicly cast Plaintiff Brian Warner, p/k/a Marilyn Manson, as a rapist and abuser—a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV, and film career,” proclaims the jury trial seeking complaint just filed this morning in Los Angeles Superior Court.
The legal salvo goes on to make some very hard and very specific accusations against Wood and Gore. It alleges that the duo hacked into the singer’s computers and social media, well as “created a fictitious email account to manufacture purported evidence that Warner was emailing illicit pornography.” The vivid complaint also drops even bigger bombshells of jurisdictional and ethical significance:
They impersonated an actual agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by forging and distributing a fictitious letter from the agent, to create the false appearance that Warner’s alleged “victims” and their families were in danger, and that there was a federal criminal investigation of Warner ongoing (Attachment A);
They provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner (Attachments B and C); and
They made knowingly false statements to prospective accusers (which have since been repeated by those accusers in court filings), including the defamatory claim that Warner filmed the sexual assault of a minor.
“We’re filing this now because we have been able to gather an overwhelming trove of evidence – including both documents and witness statements – which proves that the stories that Evan Rachel Wood and her co-conspirator Illma Gore have been falsifying and spreading are both vindictive and demonstrably untrue,” Manson’s main attorney Howard King told Deadline today. “It’s incredibly important to differentiate between the character of ‘Marilyn Manson’ and the man Brian Warner,” the King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano partner added. “Wood’s claims may resonate because of the intentionally ‘shocking’ character of ‘Marilyn Manson’ but they simply do not reflect the truth. The manufactured facts these conspirators scripted a decade after the event never happened.
Representatives for Wood did not respond to request for comment on the lawsuit today. If and when they do, we will update.
Going after unspecified damages and “an order enjoining Wood and Gore from engaging in further wrongful conduct toward Warner,” Wednesday’s timing sensitive compliant comes two weeks before the Amy Berg-directed two-part Phoenix Rising documentary on Wood’s allegations is set to premiere on HBO.
With its first installment having debuted at Sundance in January, the documentary traces Wood’s upbringing and the foundations of her seemingly deadly dalliance with Manson. As well as addressing Wood’s role in the passing of California’s statute of limitations extending Phoenix Act, Phoenix Rising also delves into the actress’ assertion that she was sexually assaulted on camera at the age of 19 in Manson’s explicit 2007 ‘Heart-Shaped Glasses’ video.
With that, acclaimed director Berg and the WarnerMedia-owned premium cabler are not named as defendants in the “defamation per se” action, at least not yet. “Amy Berg and HBO are also victims of Wood and Gore,’ Manson’s lawyer King says. “They were duped into making a documentary based on false claims and fraudulent documents,” he asserts.
The pugilistic multi-claim suit also comes just over a year after Wood took to social media to publicly name Manson as “horrifically” abusing and “grooming” her during their 2007 to 2010 relationship and when the Emmy nominee was still a teenager. Quickly dumped by his record label, TV gigs and CAA, Manson termed Wood’s claims as “horrible distortions of reality.” Subsequently, a number of others like Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco have come forward with allegations and lawsuits of their own detailing physical and psychological abuse by the Antichrist Superstar singer.
In late February 2021, the LA Sheriff’s Department’s Special Victims Bureau opened a probe into multiple abuse allegations that occurred between 2009 and 2011 when Manson lived in West Hollywood. The LASD did not respond to request for comment today by Deadline on the status of that investigation. Law enforcement sources do tell us however that the matter is ongoing.",2022-03-02T18:29:35Z,https://deadline.com,Deadline
Marilyn Manson Sues Evan Rachel Wood for Defamation Over Abuse Claims,"Marilyn Manson has sued Evan Rachel Wood for defamation over her sexual abuse allegations against him, which Manson claims are a “malicious falsehood.”
In the complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday and obtained by Variety, Manson — whose legal name is Brian Warner — alleges that Wood and “her on-again, off-again romantic partner” Ashley Gore have “publicly cast” him as a “rapist and abuser — a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV and film career.”
The filing goes on to claim that Wood and Gore impersonated a FBI agent “by forging and distributing a fictitious letter from the agent, to create the false appearance that Warner’s alleged ‘victims’ and their families were in danger, and that there was a federal criminal investigation of Warner ongoing.” It also alleges that Wood and Gore “provided checklists and scripts” to accusers and “made knowingly false statements,” including that Manson “filmed the sexual assault of a minor.” Manson has requested a jury trial and is also alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of the Comprehensive Computer Data and Access Fraud Act and impersonation over the internet.
Representatives for Wood and Gore did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.
Wood was one of several women that came forward early last year with claims of sexual abuse against Manson. In an Instagram post made at the time, Wood wrote: “The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.”
Wood and Manson’s relationship became public in 2007, when she was 19 and he was 38. They were engaged in 2010 but broke up later that year. After the allegations against Manson came out, he was dropped by his record label, manager and CAA, as well as from a role in the show “American Gods.”
Manson’s lawsuit against Wood comes on the heels of her documentary “Phoenix Rising,” which premiered at Sundance and debuts on HBO on March 15. “Phoenix Rising” further details Woods’ allegations against Manson and dives into the passage of Wood’s Phoenix Act, legislation that extends the statute of limitations for domestic violence cases in California.",2022-03-02T15:59:29Z,https://variety.com,Variety

It also claimed that Wood forged an FBI letter.

Marilyn Manson filed a defamation lawsuit against his ex-fianceé Evan Rachel Wood over her allegations that he sexually abused her.
In his Wednesday complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, which Insider has obtained, Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, calls Wood's accusations against him ""a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner's successful music, TV and film career.""
Wood has previously made allegations of abuse against Manson, including that he groomed her and he ""horrifically"" abused her as a teenager. Manson has denied these allegations, calling them in a February 2021 statement ""horrible distortions of reality.""
The actress was 19 when she began dating Manson, then 38, in 2007. They were engaged in 2010.
""This action arises from the wrongful and illegal acts done in furtherance of a conspiracy by Defendant Evan Rachel Wood and her on-again, off-again romantic partner, Defendant Ashley Gore, a/k/a Illma Gore, to publicly cast Plaintiff Brian Warner, p/k/a Marilyn Manson, as a rapist and abuser,"" the filing states.
The filing also alleges that Wood and Gore ""impersonated an actual agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by forging and distributing a fictitious letter from the agent, to create the false appearance that Warner's alleged 'victims' and their families were in danger, and that there was a federal criminal investigation of Warner ongoing.""
""Wood and Gore used that fabricated FBI letter not only to convince others to join their crusade but also to dupe HBO into distributing a one-sided 'documentary' premised on the existence of an entirely fictitious federal investigation,"" Manson's attorney Howard King told Insider in a statement in part on Wednesday.
""Even though HBO and the producers have been made aware of these serious acts of misconduct, they have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts,"" it continued. ""But the evidence of wrongdoing by Wood and Gore is irrefutable – and this legal action will hold them to account.""
Insider reached out to HBO for comment but didn't get an immediate response. The documentary will air on HBO on March 15 and 16.

Manson also accused the two defendants of creating ""a fictitious email account to manufacture purported evidence that Warner was emailing illicit pornography.""
""This detailed complaint has been filed to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner,"" Manson's attorney continued in his Wednesday statement. ""Years after the end of Evan Rachel Wood's long-term relationship with Warner, she and her girlfriend Illma Gore recruited numerous women and convinced them to make false allegations against him – claims that Wood and Gore scripted for them.""
A representative for Wood didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the filing.
In January, part one of the two-part HBO documentary ""Phoenix Rising"" was screened as a work-in-progress at the Sundance Film Festival in which Wood chronicles the abuse she said she suffered from Manson.
The documentary includes Wood saying that Manson ""essentially raped her"" when they filmed the 2007 ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)"" music video. She also said Manson scarred her with the letter ""M"" on her body.
Manson's attorney has preciously denied to Insider that the two had sex on set.
""Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth,"" he said in a statement following the screening.",2022-03-02T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Marilyn Manson Sues Sexual Abuse Accuser Evan Rachel Wood-Ahead Of HBO Documentary,"Topline
Singer Marilyn Manson sued actress Evan Rachel Wood—who publicly accused Manson of sexual abuse last year—for defamation and emotional distress Wednesday, two weeks before a documentary about Manson’s alleged treatment of Wood is set to premiere on HBO.

Key Facts
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, sued his ex-fiancée, Wood, and her “on-again, off-again romantic partner” Ashley “Illma” Gore for publicly painting him as “as a rapist and abuser—a malicious falsehood that has derailed Warner’s successful music, TV and film career,” according to the suit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by Forbes. In the suit, Manson claimed that Wood and Gore enacted a “conspiracy” to tarnish him by providing “checklists and scripts to prospective accusers, listing the specific alleged acts of abuse that they should claim against Warner,” alleged copies of which were included in the filing. Manson claimed Wood and Gore impersonated an FBI agent through a letter, a purported copy of which was also included in the filing, and said Gore created fake email accounts impersonating Manson and his attorney and hacked his email and social media accounts. Though HBO is not named as a defendant in Manson’s suit, his lawyer Howard King told Forbes in a statement that Wood’s documentary Phoenix Rising—which premieres on HBO on March 15—is “one-sided” and HBO and the project’s producers “have thus far chosen to proceed without regard for the facts.” Manson is seeking an unspecified amount in damages to be determined during trial. Forbes has reached out to Wood and Gore for comment.
Key Background
Wood and Manson dated from 2007 to 2010, when she was 20 and he was 38. Wood, who is known for her roles in the television shows Westworld and True Blood, had said previously that she was abused by an ex, and in February 2021 she publicly named Manson as her abuser in an Instagram post, writing that the singer began “grooming” her when she was a teenager. In the first part of Phoenix Rising, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January, Wood claimed Manson “essentially raped” her while filming a music video for his song “Heart-Shaped Glasses.” “We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that. . . . I did not feel safe,” she said, according to Rolling Stone (Manson denied this through his lawyer). Several other women have accused Manson of multiple forms of abuse, all of which he denied. His former assistant Ashley Waters sued him in May for sexual assault, battery and harassment, and actress Esmé Bianco sued him in April for sexual assault and sex trafficking. In November, Manson’s Los Angeles-area home was raided by the authorities as part of an investigation into the claims of abuse made against him.

Marilyn Manson Accuser Timeline Called Into Question by Judge,"One of Marilyn Manson's accusers has been questioned by a judge about why it took her so long to sue the musician.
Ashley Walters, a former assistant of Manson—whose real name is Brian Warner—sued the musician for sexual assault, battery and harassment in 2021. She is among a number of women, including actresses Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco, who are pursuing legal action against the shock rocker. Manson has denied the allegations.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael L. Stern has now said that Walters must explain why she waited so long to file a case against Manson.
Walters, 37, worked with and for Manson Records from May 2010 to October 2011 and alleges the singer sexually abused and battered her multiple times.
Now, the judge has questioned why she did not file her lawsuit until May 2021.
According to court documents seen by Newsweek, Stern wrote: ""Reading the first amended complaint as a whole, (Walters) pleads that (she) was aware of the actions against her by the time she left her employment. Thus, nine to 10 years passed until the filing of the action, far beyond the two-year limitations periods of her claims.""
According to the judge, Walters' ""sexual assault cause of action as pleaded is not subject to the most recent amendment providing for a ten-year limitations' period as this revision is not retroactive.""
He ordered Walters to file an amended complaint by March 11.
In her lawsuit, per The Cut, Walters' attorneys wrote that Manson ""used his position of power, celebrity and connections to exploit and victimize"" his then staff member and that he ""lured Ms. Walters into employment with promises of artistic collaborations and creative opportunities.""
Walters' lawyers said that Manson ""was looking to create an environment where [Walters] was subjected to personal and professional sexual exploitation, manipulation and psychological abuse.""
The ""Tainted Love"" singer has denied all allegations against him.
He wrote in a statement on Instagram in 2021: ""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how—and why—others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
The 53-year-old is facing up to four lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault, battery and harassment. An investigation into allegations of domestic violence incidents by the Los Angeles County sheriff's department is also underway and his home was raided in November 2021.

Marilyn Manson: Trailer released for Evan Rachel Wood's Phoenix Rising documentary on abuse allegations,"Evan Rachel Wood is due to speak out in a new documentary about the alleged abuse she suffered during her relationship with Marilyn Manson.
""I'm here today to talk about Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,"" the actress and activist says in the trailer for HBO's Phoenix Rising.
Wood, star of TV sci-fi series Westworld and Disney's Frozen II, publicly accused Manson of abuse with a statement released on Instagram in February 2021, and said he began ""grooming"" her when she was a teenager.
The rock musician was subsequently dropped by his record label and cut from two TV shows.

The Los Angeles County sheriff's department said at the time that its detectives were investigating reports of domestic violence between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived.
Manson, real name Brian Warner, has denied allegations of abuse.
""Numerous women heard my story and they knew exactly who it was,"" Wood says in the new trailer, about making her allegations public. ""I realised that I wasn't the only one that this had happened to.""
Wood, now 34, reportedly met Manson in 2005, when she was aged 18 and he was 36.
It is not clear exactly when their relationship started but they got engaged in 2010. However, they called off the relationship just seven months later.
HBO says the two-part documentary, which will air in the US in March, ""follows actress and activist Evan Rachel Wood as she takes her experience as a survivor of domestic violence to pursue justice, heal generational wounds, and reclaim her story"".
Manson found fame in the 1990s with albums including Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals, and was known for his distinctive appearance and often shocking stage shows.
Sky News has contacted representatives for the musician for comment on the Phoenix Rising trailer.
When Wood went public with her allegations in 2021, he responded with a statement on social media, saying: ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""",2022-02-23T12:33:00Z,https://news.sky.com,Sky News
"Kanye West 'Donda 2' Guests: Playboi Carti, Jack Harlow, a Kim Sample","Coincidentally or not, Kanye West’s livestream and theatrical simulcast of his “Donda Experience” event Tuesday night seemed to make some use of a staging conceit that Adele had recently nixed for her scotched Las Vegas residency. The latter singer had reportedly balked at a design that would have had appear to be in or floating atop the middle of a large pool. But for West, walking on (or in) water was just the ticket.
The “Donda 2” event at Miami’s LoanDepot Park — which was ultimately streamed (and remains available) on YouTube, despite West’s earlier assurances that it wouldn’t be — had the performer pacing around a full-sized replication of his Chicago childhood home, a la the last listening party for his previous “Donda” album last year. But this time it was surrounded by a lake of two or three inches of water laid out across the LoanDepot field, which required waders not only of West but guest performers like Jack Harlow, Playboi Carti, Pusha T, Migos, Baby Keem, Fivio Foreign, the Game, the Sunday Service Choir and (notoriously returning from the last “Donda” listening party) Marilyn Manson and DaBaby. Alicia Keys, who played piano as well as sang on one of the concluding numbers, did get to keep her feet dry.
The “Donda 2” album itself did not drop Tuesday night, although perhaps only those who already purchased and received a $200-plus Stem Player from West’s web store would be able to know for sure, since the hip-hop titan has vowed that only those who own one of his new handheld listening/mixing devices will be able to hear the recording. It’s possible that it won’t turn out to be that exclusive after all, since West did broaden the audience for Tuesday’s “Donda Experience” at virtually the last minute. Initially he announced that he’d turned down an Apple Music deal to stream the event, and it appeared that it would only be viewable beyond the Miami stadium on IMAX theaters in 15 cities, at a cost of $20-30. Then, Tuesday afternoon, a message went out that it could be seen live “only on stemplayer.com.” Ultimately it also went out for free via YouTube and Amazon’s Twitch service, despite West having railed against those tech giants in the last week when he sent out the message, “Donda 2 will only be available on my own platform, the Stem Player. Not on Apple Amazon Spotify or YouTube… It’s time to free music from this oppressive system.”
Tuesday night’s show began at 10:45 p.m. ET, an hour and 45 minutes past the advertised showtime, which allowed for lots of extra popcorn sales in the nationwide IMAX theaters where ticket buyers were cooling their heels watching a screen saver and listening to a heartbeat on loop. The 80-minute set that followed was ultimately broken into two parts, divided by a moment in the show when the building at the center of the wading pool split in two, literally becoming a divided home, seen by fans as a likely reference to the impending divorce that has occupied West’s attention lately.
Preceding that literal split was a 16-song set mostly consisting of songs that have been promised for the “Donda 2” album, although not in the order that they have appeared on track lists that West has posted on Instagram. Also sneaking in there among the newbies were a pair of more familiar songs: the Game collaboration “Eazy” and the Pusha T collab “Diet Coke.”
Following the break, so to speak, another 10 tracks were played, half of them from last year’s “Donda” album, along with bonuses like the Sunday Service song “Jesus Is King” and the just-released Fivio/Alicia Keys collaboration “City of Gods.” The show concluded with West being joined again by Fivio as well as Playboi Carti for the “Donda” track “Off the Grid,” before a sudden plume of light torching up toward the rafters signaled the end of the experience.
As with previous “Donda” shows in 2021, this one skirted the line between concert, listening party and interpretive dance event, with West and guests mostly pantomiming to the music — or, in the case of a nearly still-life Manson and DaBaby during “Jail”, just loitering — or having what was taken to be the Sunday Service Choir march or stand in formation in dark, militaristic helmets and uniforms while motorcycles circled the perimeter. Although there was little pretense of even lip-synching for most of the show, at least two performers appeared to be notably live in their vocals — Keys, as she started off “City of Gods” alone at the piano before being joined by her own multi-tracked vocals and collaborators, and Playboi Carti, whose flamboyantly screeched vocals set off peels of admiring laughter among the pleased audience at a screening Variety attended at Hollywood’s Chinese Theatre.
Kanye West with Marilyn Manson and DaBaby at ‘Donda Experience’ livestream
Not all the guests who are set to appear on the “Donda 2” album were there to mime or dance to their parts in person. Most obviously, that would include the late XXXtentacion, heard toward the very beginning of the performance. Also heard on the new album tracks were a few other guests who, for whatever reason, did not make the trip to Miami, including Future, Travis Scott and Soulja Boy, whose apparent reconciliation with West after a public beef would have made for a memorable visual.
But the apparent “guest” on “Donda 2” whose lack of a live appearance was most foreordained was estranged wife Kim Kardashian. A snippet of her monologue from her 2021 “Saturday Night Live” hosting gig, before she filed for divorce, was loudly played at the beginning of the new “Sci-Fi,” as Kardashian was loudly heard to exclaim, “I married the best rapper of all time. Not only that, he is the richest Black man in America. A talented, legit genius who gave me four incredible kids.”
Given the amount of time West has devoted on social media of late to imploring Kardashian to get back together with him, and/or focusing on family disputes and her romance with Pete Davidson, there was less time overtly spent on those matters than might have been expected. But there was still plenty. “Never take the family picture off the fridge / Never stand between a man and his kids / Y’all ain’t got enough security for this,” went the refrain from a new song, “Security.”
Full assessments of “Donda 2” will have to wait for when the album is released — or if is released in anything close to the form heard Tuesday, as West premiered multiple iterations of the previous album in arena events before the final release version. Many viewers complained about the audio, although it would seem that any trouble making out lyrics may have been a deliberate part of the sound design for a new album that is very different from “Donda 1.” The whole sonic approach of the new album seems distinct enough that it isn’t necessarily clear why he’s billing it as a sequel, beyond release proximity. Whereas the last “Donda” was more of a stylistic tour de force, what was revealed of “Donda 2” Tuesday night feels like much more of a mood piece, with extended hypnotic passages replacing the pop hooks or gospel moments found on the last album. When several of the song early in the performance emphasized heavily AutoTuned vocals sung rather than rapped by West — especially “Too Easy” — a listener might even have wondered if the album should be called “808s & Heartbreak 2” instead of “Donda 2.”
Audio aside, few would likely dispute how successfully cinematic the show was, in or out of the theatrical setting, with West — as is his recent wont — no doubt directing director Aus Taylor to favor long, uninterrupted takes that allowed for every ripple in the pool to extend across the screen. The lighting was kept low, which made for a spooky effect when West sat alone on the steps of his quasi-burned-out house, nearly in the dark (with concession signs for the venue still brightly lit up in the distance). Although West does like his constant smoke or fog effects, thankfully, he did not spend very much of the show engulfed in a completely impenetrable fog, as he did in the recent livestream of his co-headlining gig with Drake at the L.A. Coliseum.
Not every beef West invoked Tuesday involved family. The collaboration with Harlow that was debuted, “Louis Bags,” was a sort of anti-commercial that had West expressing an apparent preference for Gucci as he led into the refrain: “I stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed” (a reference to the death of his friend Virgil Abloh, an artistic director for the fashion design house).
The Kardashian speech snippet was the most obviously risible moment of a show that was actually relatively rather light on outright provocation, embedded lyrics about Kim-and-Pete aside. The big, rebellious moment was a rerun, with Manson (or, as Rolling Stone repeatedly refers to him, “accused rapist Marilyn Manson”) and alleged homophobe DaBaby simply repeating their highly controversial walk-ons from last year’s “Donda” event, as if West simply wanted to impart that he’s not the backing-down type. But we knew that.

Phoenix Rising: First trailer for Evan Rachel Wood documentary tackles Marilyn Manson abuse allegations,"Something went wrong, please try again later.
In the first trailer for the new Evan Rachel Wood documentary, a voice tells us that, statistically, many domestic and sexual abuse victims take seven to 10 years to recognise they were even a victim of the abuse.
This is the story of Evan Rachel Wood, the successful Hollywood actor who last year publicly accused Marilyn Manson of abusing her when she was just 19 years of age, an accusation he denies.
Phoenix Rising – What you need to know
Manson and Wood were in a relationship from 2006 to 2010. In the trailer for the HBO documentary, which is in two parts, we see the 34-year-old actress and her family describe him as a ""predator"".
There is also footage of Wood, now a committed activist, testifying before the California Senate to help pass the Phoenix Act, which successfully extended the statute of limitations in domestic violence cases from three to five years.
We also see her talk with other women who have since come forward with allegations of abuse against the rock star, whose real name is Brian Warner.
The documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month, with The Telegraph describing it as ""blazingly courageous"" and ""a necessary watch"".
It's set to debut on HBO Max in the US on Tuesday, March 15, with both episodes available at the same time.
While a global release is yet to be announced, it looks to be a given, so expect news on that front in the coming weeks. Sky Atlantic will be a likely home for the new documentary.",2022-02-23T10:48:17Z,https://www.buzz.ie,Buzz.ie

Albumet lanserades genom ett påkostat och storslaget event, som livesändes från Florida i Kanye Wests sociala medier. Artister som Alicia Keys, Marilyn Manson, DaBaby och Travis Scott ska ha medverkat under kvällen.
Men hur låter albumet? Det är det ännu inte många som vet, eftersom Donda 2 inte har släppts hos de stora strömningstjänsterna. I stället finns musiken att lyssna till på en musikspelare, som Kanye West själv har lanserat.

The preview saw the 34-year-old star reflect on her activism for sexual assault survivors and her belief that her campaigning has finally struck a chord.
She said: “I became an activist, fighting for victims and survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Not only did people hear our stories but they said, ‘Yeah, we hear you, and something does need to change’. We need to make sure this doesn’t happen to anybody else.
“I realized that this is the first time I haven’t been doubted or questioned or shamed, this is the first time that someone was really listening.
“I was like, ‘What is this feeling?’ And it’s this feeling of being believed.”
In 2018, Evan spoke in Congress in support of the nationwide implementation of the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Acts, and though she didn’t name her alleged abuser at the time, she admitted people knew who she was talking about.
She said: “Numerous women heard my story, and knew exactly who it was.”
Evan first accused Manson of “horrifically abusing” her last February and claims that her ex-fiancé “brainwashed” her and “manipulated her into submission”.
Her admission prompted a wave of other allegations against the ‘Rock is Dead’ singer, who has denied the claims against him.

"Kanye West Joined By Alicia Keys, Migos, Jack Harlow, Fivio Foreign, DaBaby, Marilyn Manson & More For ""Donda 2"" Performance","The Donda 2 Experience has wrapped in Miami and the entire world tuned in. Kanye West has stolen attention for months with his Donda and Donda 2 releases, and this latest live show has outdone his last. We've watched as West has nearly broken the internet with each new social media post over the last few weeks as he targeted Pete Davidson and pleaded with estranged wife Kim Kardashian to rebuild their family. Ye has taken a break from those antics to refocus in album mode and tonight, he was joined on stage by his Donda 2 collaborators as well as his choir.
The event streamed for free on West's YouTube channel, although it arrived over two hours after many believed it was supposed to have begun. The set was completed with a house that was surrounded by shallow water, and as each song played, the Rap mogul's peers came forward one by one.
Alicia Keys and Fivio Foreign performed ""City of Gods"" with the singer tickling the ivories, but that wasn't the only surprise. The Game, Migos, Jack Harlow, Marilyn Manson, and DaBaby showed face, and features on Donda 2 also include Soulja Boy,Future, a posthumous look from XXXTentacion, and many others. Unsurprisingly, many of West's lyrics were about his divorce from Kim as well as the world's responses to his comments. There was also a sample of Kim's Saturday Night Live appearance, Vice President Kamala Harris's ""We Did It Joe"" meme, as well as a tribute to the late Virgil Abloh with the bar, ""I stopped buying Louis [Vuitton] after Virgil passed.""
Although the performance didn't seem to have any major setbacks, there was a bit of an audio issue toward the end. As Fivio was performing live with the track, there was a delay for those watching from home. It made for a dislodged sound between the track playing and what the rapper was saying on the mic, so much so that people complained about it on social media. There was also an issue during his performance with Manson and DaBaby, prompting West to throw his microphone and continue on without it, thus prompting a new hashtag about all of the engineers being fired from production.
Meanwhile, Donda 2 is yet another emotional outpouring of West's thoughts and emotions, and much of the album teetered the lines 808s & Heartbreak and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Fans will be able to stream this one on West's Stem Player and it is surely going to be a moneymaker for the Rap mogul.

Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) brought accused rapist Marilyn Manson onstage during a listening event for his new album ""Donda 2.""
Manson — who has been accused of sexual assault and battery by at least 16 women — appeared alongside Ye at the music event, which took place Tuesday at the LoanDepot Park stadium in Miami, Florida.
The pair shared the stage with the rapper DaBaby and performed their song ""Jail Pt.2"" from Ye's 2021 album ""Donda."" Footage from the evening, which has been shared widely on social media, shows the stadium's audio beginning to fail as the trio attempt to perform. At one point, Ye throws his microphone away as the audio collapses.
The moment was shared widely across social media websites.
Earlier this month, Digital Nas, one of Ye's close collaborators, told Rolling Stone that Manson had been working closely with Ye on ""Donda.""
""Every day I go to the studio, Marilyn is in there working on 'Donda 2,'"" Nas told the publication.
Nas continued to say that Ye doesn't want Manson to perform ""rap beats"" on the upcoming album. The rapper has instead asked Manson to bring his own sound to the project.
""He wants Marilyn to play what he makes, and then Ye will take parts of that and sample parts of that and use parts of that like he did [when making] 'Yeezus,'"" Nas said. ""He has some producers from 'Yeezus' working on 'Donda 2' this time around, Marilyn, me, a bunch of producers from 'Donda 1.'""
As mentioned above, this isn't the first time that Ye has collaborated with Manson.
Ye received backlash last year for featuring Manson — whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner — on the song ""Jail Pt.2"" from 2021's ""Donda."" Manson also appeared at one of Ye's stadium listening parties for the album at Soldier Field in Chicago.
Manson has been accused of sexual and physical abuse by multiple women, including his former partner actor Evan Rachel Wood who publicly made allegations against the singer in February 2021.

In an Instagram post, the ""Westworld"" star accused Manson of ""grooming"" her as a teenager and ""horrifically"" abusing her for years.
""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,"" she said in a statement posted on Instagram. ""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.""
In a new two-part documentary titled ""Phoenix Rising,"" Wood said Mason ""essentially raped her"" when they filmed a music video together in 2007.
In the documentary, which will premiere in March on HBO, Wood said that filming the video for the 2007 Manson song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)"" did not happen in the way it was pitched to her.
""We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real,"" Wood said in the documentary, which is directed by Amy Berg (""West of Memphis"").
Manson denied the allegations against him in an Instagram post last year describing them as ""horrible distortions of reality.""",2022-02-23T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
"Evan Rachel Wood Shares ""Phoenix Rising"" Trailer Detailing Alleged Abuse By Marilyn Manson","There have been several discussions about Evan Rachel Wood's controversial documentary, Phoenix Rising. The award-winning actress was once involved with shock-rocker Marilyn Manson and in recent years, she had made headlines following allegations she has made about her ex. Wood has accused Manson of sexual assault and abuse, but she isn't the only person who has come forward; according to reports, a woman who once worked for Manson, as well as Game of Thrones actress Esmé Blanco, have filed lawsuits against the musician.
Meanwhile, Wood has reportedly claimed that Manson threatened to sexually assault her son and allegedly raped her while they filmed a music video together. He has denied the accusations.
Phoenix Rising recently made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival and now, the world has received a first look after a trailer for the film has been shared.
""He studied how to manipulate people. He groomed her,"" said Wood's mother in the clip. ""He's a predator."" In the clip, the actress showed off injuries allegedly sustained at the hands of Manson and is seen pursuing legal action, although she mentioned that the statute of limitations expired.
There seemed to be an emphasis placed on the public viewing Manson not as the international rock icon but as Brian Warner, the man behind the makeup and outlandish performances. With each allegation and news report, Marilyn Manson has come forward on his own or via his legal representation to vehemently deny that he harm or assaulted anyone.

Kanye West Premiered New Album Donda 2 at Miami Event: Here’s What Happened,"Kanye West’s “Donda Experience Performance” event, marking the premiere of his new album and Donda sequel Donda 2, took place on February 22 at LoanDepot Park in Miami. Billed as a “DONDA 2 listening and DONDA 1 performance” by West on Instagram, the event’s livestream happened at Imax theaters, on West’s Stem Player website, and on YouTube.
After over two hours of heartbeat noise, the show began with a house on fire and a new song that appeared to feature posthumous vocals from XXXTentacion. As multiple new songs played in the stadium, West danced near the flaming house while wading through water. He shared “Flowers,” which he teased with his Stem Player exclusivity announcement, and “Eazy.”
West was joined in the water by Migos as a new song featuring Baby Keem and the trio played. The next two songs featured Future, who is said to have executive produced the album. The latter, “Pablo,” also featured Travis Scott. Pusha T appeared in the stadium as his new single “Diet Coke” played.
A subsequent song called “Louis Bag” opened with a sample of Vice President Kamala Harris’ “We did it, Joe” phone call. It featured Jack Harlow (who appeared at the event), and West’s repeated line, “We stopped buying Louis bags after Virgil passed.” It was followed by another song featuring Future. A sample of Kim Kardashian West’s Saturday Night Live monologue about Kanye West opened the next track (though not the punchline: “So, when I divorced him, you have to know it came down to just one thing: his personality!”). The next song began with a TikTok-popular Empire sample.
The event pivoted to a live performance, which featured the Sunday Service choir and multiple songs from Donda. Marilyn Manson, who is facing multiple sexual assault lawsuits and is the subject of a new documentary that outlines allegations of abuse, once again joined West and DaBaby during “Jail.” Fivio Foreign and Alicia Keys delivered a live performance of the new single “City of Gods.” Soulja Boy appeared to be featured on “Fist Time in a Long Time” amid an on-again, off-again feud with West. The event ended with a performance of “Off the Grid” that featured Playboi Carti (in apparent Joker makeup) and Fivio Foreign.
Donda 2 will purportedly be made available exclusively through West’s Donda Stem Player. He claimed that he turned down a $100 million deal from Apple, choosing instead to release the album via his own platform. In late January, West had announced that Donda 2 would arrive on February 22, but it did not appear online or on the stem players at midnight. So far, four songs—“Security,” “Pablo,” “Open Road,” and “We Did It Kid”—are available at Stem Player.",2022-02-23T01:06:26Z,https://pitchfork.com,Pitchfork
Evan Rachel Wood abre o jogo sobre abusos de Marilyn Manson em documentário,"SÃO PAULO, SP (UOL/FOLHAPRESS) – A HBO acaba de divulgar o primeiro trailer completo de “Phoenix Rising” (A Ascensão da Fênix), documentário dividido em duas partes que relata os abusos vivenciados pela atriz Evan Rachel Wood, 34 anos, do músico Marilyn Manson, 53, com quem ela se relacionou entre 2007 e 2010.
“Estou aqui hoje [terça (22)] para falar sobre Brian Warner, mais conhecido por todos como Marilyn Manson”, declara a atriz de filmes como “Tudo Pode Dar Certo” (2009) e “O Seu Jeito de Amar” (2014) logo no início do vídeo, com menos de dois minutos de duração.
O documentário conta também com depoimentos de parentes de Wood a respeito do caso. “Ele tem formas calculadas de manipular as pessoas. Ele fez lavagem cerebral nela. Ele é um predador”, declara a mãe da atriz, Sara Lynn Moore, em outro trecho do trailer.
“Esta é a primeira vez que não sou posta em dúvida, questionada ou envergonhada. É a primeira vez que sou simplesmente ouvida. [A sensação é] de ser acreditada”, afirma ainda Evan, nos segundos finais do vídeo.
“Phoenix Rising” tem lançamento confirmado para o dia 15 de março, tanto no canal HBO como na plataforma HBO Max. O documentário tem direção de Amy Berg, conhecida por seu trabalho no filme de terror “Livrai-nos do Mal” (2014).",2022-02-22T20:27:00Z,https://www.mixvale.com.br,Portal Mix Vale
Evan Rachel Wood Talks Marilyn Manson in ‘Phoenix Rising’ Trailer,"All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors. However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.
Evan Rachel Wood is sharing her journey from abuse victim to activist in the powerful new trailer for the upcoming HBO Max documentary Phoenix Rising.
The two-minute clip finds the actress referring to her alleged abuser and former fiance, Marilyn Manson, by his real name — Brian Warner. “Numerous women heard my story, and knew exactly who it was,” she explains in the trailer, referring to her testimony before Congress in 2018, where Wood detailed her personal experience with sexual assault, without naming names at the time. In 2021, Wood officially named Manson as her alleged abuser via Instagram.

“The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,” she wrote at the time. “He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander or blackmail.”
“I wasn’t the only one that this had happened to,” Wood claims in the trailer, as she’s seen hugging other women who have come forward with allegations against the rock star.
The two-part documentary will delve into Wood’s recounting of the ways in which Manson allegedly abused her sexually and controlled her, and her journey as an advocate for the Phoenix Act, a 2019 law that extended the statute of limitations for sexual abuse survivors in California. The documentary also features interviews with Wood’s mother and brother, who claim in the trailer that Manson “groomed” Wood as a young actress.
“We need to make sure that this doesn’t happen to anybody else,” Wood says. “I realize that this is the first time I haven’t been doubted or questioned or shamed. This is the first time that someone was really listening. And I was like, ‘What is this feeling?’ And it’s this feeling of being believed.”
In the film, which premiered at Sundance in January, the actress alleges that the rocker sexually assaulted her while they were filming his music video for “Heart-Shaped Glasses.” Howard King, Manson’s lawyer, denied that accusation. “Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the ‘Heart-Shaped Glasses’ music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses,” he said in a statement shared with Billboard at the time. “Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.”
Manson has also denied all accusations of assault and abuse against him since the actress first named him as her abuser. Immediately following Wood’s allegations in 2021, he took to Instagram to deny the abuse claims. “Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,” he wrote. “My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”

Phoenix Rising Trailer: Evan Rachel Wood Details Marilyn Manson Abuse,"“I’m here today to talk about Brian Werner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,” Evan Rachel Wood says in the official trailer for Amy Berg’s two-part HBO documentary “Rising Phoenix.” The movie, which world premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month, finds Wood reflecting on her abuse allegations against Marilyn Manson and connecting with other women who came forward with stories against the singer.
HBO’s official synopsis for “Phoenix Rising” reads: “The documentary follows actress and activist Evan Rachel Wood as she takes her experience as a survivor of domestic violence to pursue justice, heal generational wounds and reclaim her story. Almost a decade after escaping a dangerous relationship, Wood co-authors and successfully lobbies for passage of The Phoenix Act, legislation that extends the statute of limitations for domestic violence cases in California. Wood courageously uses her own experience to bring visibility to the issue; ultimately, in solidarity with fellow survivors.”
“Phoenix Rising” made headlines out of Sundance due to Wood’s revelation in the documentary that she was “essentially raped on-camera” while filming the 2007 music video for Marilyn Manson’s “Heart-Shaped Glasses.” The video features Wood having sex with Manson while fake blood rains down on them. Wood was 19 years old when she filmed the music video and alleges that she was fed absinthe on set to the point that she was barely conscious to object when Manson had sex with her on camera. Manson has denied the allegation.
“It’s nothing like I thought it was going to be,” Wood says in the documentary. “We’re doing things that were not what was pitched to me. We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that. … It was complete chaos. I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me.”
HBO will premiere “Phoenix Rising” on back-to-back nights. Part 1, “Phoenix Rising: Don’t Fall,” debuts Tuesday, March 15 at 9 p.m. ET. Part 2, “Phoenix Rising: Stand Up,” debuts Wednesday, March 16 at the same time.

Evan Rachel Wood im Interview über ihre Dokumentation und Marilyn Manson,"1/6 Evan Rachel Wood will nicht länger schweigen. Die Schauspielerin macht in ihrer Dokumentation …
2/6 … «Phoenix Rising» den sexuellen, physischen und psychischen Missbrauch durch ihren Ex-Partner …,
3/6
5/6 Manson bestreitet die Vorwürfe, die damals 18-jährige Wood missbraucht zu haben.
6/6 Einem grossen Publikum wurde Evan Rachel Wood durch ihre Rolle der Dolores in der HBO-Erfolgsserie «Westworld» bekannt.
Interview: Patricia Danaher
Evan Rachel Wood (34) war erst 18 Jahre alt, als sie den 20 Jahre älteren Marilyn Manson (53) kennenlernte. Während der Beziehung ging sie durch die Hölle, erlebte physischen und psychischen Missbrauch durch den Sänger.
In ihrer Dokumentation «Rising Phoenix» macht sie die Grausamkeiten öffentlich: Von gegenseitigem «Brandmarken», über Vergewaltigung vor laufenden Kameras, bis hin zu Mansons Nazi-Parolen, die er dem jüdischen Hollywood-Star an den Kopf warf.
Was hat Sie dazu bewegt, in dieser so persönlichen Dokumentation mitzuwirken?
Evan Rachel Wood: Ich war schon immer ein Mensch, für den Privatsphäre sehr wichtig ist. Und wer mich kennt, der weiss, diese Doku wäre das letzte im Leben gewesen, was ich gewollt hätte. Und dennoch war ich es, die diese Geschichte unbedingt erzählen wollte!
Sie haben viele Jahre über Ihr schlimmes Schicksal geschwiegen. Was hat Sie am Ende dazu bewegt, doch damit an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen?
Es war einfach an der Zeit, die Wahrheit zu sagen. Es war für mich an der Zeit, endlich meine Seite der Story zu erzählen. Und das musste ich selbst machen, das konnte ich niemandem anderes überlassen.
Frauen in ähnlichen Situationen schweigen oft aus Angst, dass man ihnen nicht glauben wird. Hatten Sie diese Sorge anfangs auch?
Die Leute werden glauben, was sie glauben wollen. Es ist nicht meine Aufgabe, jemanden zu überzeugen. Ich lüge nicht. Mein Job ist es, die Wahrheit zu sagen. Und das ist, was ich in dieser Doku getan habe. Und das ist auch alles, was ich tun konnte.
Mit sieben Jahren das erste Mal vor der Kamera Evan Rachel Wood wurde 1987 in Californien als Tochter zweier Schauspieler geboren. Ihre ersten Erfahrungen vor der Kamera sammelte sie bereits im zarten Alter von sieben Jahren. Als Teenager erreichte Wood ihren Durchbruch im Drama «Thirteen». Für ihre Rolle als Jugendliche, die in eine Spirale aus harten Drogen, Sex und Gewalt gerät, wurde sie für einen Golden Globe nominiert. 2016 spielt sie die Rolle der Dolores Abernathy in der Si-Fi-Serie «Westworld», für die sie zahlreiche Preise abräumte. 2021 machte Wood bekannt, dass sie in ihrer Dokumentation «Phoenix Rising» ihre von Gewalt geprägte Beziehung mit dem Sänger Marilyn Manson (53) thematisieren wird. Sie klagt den Musiker an, sie mit 18 Jahren auf verschiedene ArtEN missbraucht zu haben. Manson bestreitet die Vorwürfe.

Was erhoffen Sie sich von dieser Dokumentation?
Sie überhaupt produzieren zu können, hat mein Leben verändert. Nicht nur konnte ich meine eigene Art von Gerechtigkeit erreichen, wir können auch anderen Überlebenden von häuslicher Gewalt eine Stimme geben. Leider ist meine Geschichte nicht ungewöhnlich. Und mir geht es nicht nur darum, die Person, die mir das angetan hat, anzuprangern. Wir wollen auch zeigen, was genau häusliche Gewalt ist und wie man da reingeraten kann.
Sie sagen, dass Sie als Kinderstar eingetrichtert bekamen, zu allem Ja zu sagen. Wie sehr hat das in Ihrer Beziehung mit Marilyn Manson eine Rolle gespielt?
Was auch immer passiert ist, bevor ich Brian Warner* kennengelernt habe, ist irrelevant. Schlussendlich liegt die Schuld am Missbrauch allein bei Brian. Natürlich zeigen wir auch, dass es bei mir gewisse familiäre Muster gab. Aber um es noch einmal ganz klarzumachen: Ich liebe meine Eltern sehr. War es ihre Schuld, dass ich von Brian missbraucht wurde? Auf keinen Fall!
In der Doku wird deutlich, dass Marilyn Manson lange von der Musikindustrie geschützt wurde …
… weshalb ich hoffe, dass diese Doku endgültig ein Wachmacher ist. Wie die Medien mit der Story von Marilyn Manson jahrelang umgegangen sind, war einfach nur beschämend. Deshalb war es höchste Zeit, dass wir als Überlebende des Missbrauchs endlich unsere Geschichte aus unserer eigenen Sicht und ohne Filter erzählen.",2022-02-12T18:59:05Z,https://www.blick.ch,BLICK.CH
Quand Johnny Depp et Marilyn Manson échangeaient des SMS sur les violences conjugales,"Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images
PEOPLE - Deux mois après le verdict du procès opposant Amber Heard à Johnny Depp, 6 000 pages de documents juridiques, jusqu’alors inconnus du grand public, ont été publiés en ligne. Parmi les informations, des conversations téléphoniques datant de 2016 entre Johnny Depp et le chanteur Marilyn Manson, où les deux hommes échangent sur leurs accusations respectives de violences conjugales.
À cette époque, Lindsay Usich, actuelle épouse de Marilyn Manson, avait obtenu une ordonnance de protection, après avoir accusé ce dernier de violences et de possession de drogues. Marilyn Manson avait alors envoyé le SMS suivant à Johnny Depp : « Lindsay m’a fait une Amber… supprime s’il te plaît. »
« Te laisse pas faire. Le plus important est de rester calme et de ne pas lui donner ce qu’elle attend, c’est-à-dire te faire hurler, te rendre dingue, et nourrir son narcissisme. J’ai beaucoup lu sur le sujet et sur les comportements de sociopathe », avait répondu l’acteur, le tout en qualifiant son ex-femme de « salope. »
Je crois que les flics vont passer chez moi. »
Trouvant une oreille attentive à ses problèmes, le chanteur était revenu vers son ami la même année en lui demandant à nouveau de l’aide selon les informations New York Post : « J’ai un gros souci de type Amber avec la famille de L [Lindsay, ndlr]. Je suis en stress putain. Je ne sais pas si tu es de retour, mais je vais avoir besoin d’un refuge car je crois que les flics vont passer chez moi. »
Pour rappel, Marilyn Manson est accusé par plusieurs ex-compagnes de violences sexuelles - dont Lindsay Usich, mais aussi Evan Rachel Wood. Elle dit avoir été violée par le chanteur lors d’un tournage d’un clip en 2007. Il nie en bloc et l’a attaqué pour diffamation.
Ces documents n’ont pas été divulgués lors du procès entre Johnny Depp et Amber Heard, après des « manœuvres » des avocats des deux parties. Selon ceux de l’acteur, il s’agissait d’une tentative d’Amber Heard d’inclure le nom de Marilyn Manson au dossier qui « manque de fondement et est entièrement spéculatif et constitue une preuve de moralité inappropriée. »
Faire passer Amber Heard pour une escort girl
Les échanges douteux entre l’acteur et le chanteur ont continué, mais sur d’autres sujets. Selon les documents du Daily Mail, Marilyn Manson a proposé à son ami de lui présenter une nouvelle fan, indiquant qu’elle a l’âge légal. Ils font aussi une référence au film Salò ou les 120 journées de Sodome, fortement censuré pour montrer crûment des scènes de viol, de torture, de mutilation ou de meurtre. Ils évoquent la possibilité d’avoir leur propre « grotte » en disant : « Ayons notre propre Salò. Mais pas de trucs gays avec nous. »
L’acteur souhaitait, de son côté, apporté d’autres informations compromettantes pour son ex-épouse dont des « photos d’Amber Heard nue », notamment lorsqu’elle « a brièvement été danseuse exotique », selon les documents. Une tentative de la faire passer pour une escort girl selon les avocats de l’actrice. Un avis d’ailleurs partagé par la juge car elle n’a pas retenu cet argument.

This isn't the first time that Ye has collaborated with Manson.
Ye received backlash last year for featuring Manson — whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner — on the song ""Jail Pt.2"" from his 2021 album ""Donda."" Manson also appeared at one of Ye's stadium listening parties for the album at Soldier Field in Chicago.
Manson has been accused of sexual and physical abuse by multiple women, including his former partner actor Evan Rachel Wood who publicly made allegations against the singer in February 2021.
In an Instagram post, the ""Westworld"" star accused Manson of ""grooming"" her as a teenager and ""horrifically"" abusing her for years.
""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,"" she said in a statement posted on Instagram. ""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.""
In a new two-part documentary titled ""Phoenix Rising,"" Wood said Mason ""essentially raped her"" when they filmed a music video together in 2007.
In the documentary, which will premiere in March on HBO, Wood said that filming the video for the 2007 Manson song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)"" did not happen in the way it was pitched to her.
""We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real,"" Wood said in the documentary, which is directed by Amy Berg (""West of Memphis"").
Manson denied the allegations against him in an Instagram post last year describing them as ""horrible distortions of reality.""",2022-02-01T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
"Marilyn Manson Is Working Closely With Kanye West On ""Donda 2""","It came as a shock to find accused rapist Marilyn Manson standing on stage alongside Kanye West at the Donda listening party at the Soldier Field. It was even more shocking that he had songwriting credits on the album's song ""Jail."" His contributions were subtle on Donda but it appears that won't be the case in the sequel.

“I see Marilyn a lot in the studio,” producer Digital Nas told Rolling Stone of Manson's contributions to Ye's new album. “Like, every day I go to the studio, Marilyn is there working on Donda 2.“
Manson's collaborator Tim Skold previously posted a picture on Instagram, hinting at a collaboration with West.Nas explained that West has locked in with Manson and his collaborators on production and songwriting on the album. Nas added that Ye doesn't want Manson to step out of his comfort zone creatively.
""He wants Marilyn to play what he makes, and then Ye will take parts of that and sample parts of that and use parts of that, like he did [generally when making] Yeezus,"" Nas continued. ""He has some producers from Yeezus working on Donda 2 this time around, [as well as] Marilyn, me, a bunch of producers from Donda 1.”

While reps for Manson confirmed that he was ""continuing his creative collaboration with Ye,"" Digital Nas explained that Kanye isn't necessarily looking to be controversial by his association with the rocker and could be the same reason why Ye embraced DaBaby, too. ""I think it’s moreso that Ye is coming from a standpoint of like, ‘We all make mistakes,’ ” he says. “I think that’s maybe why he had DaBaby and Marilyn at that one show. I’m just assuming it is from a standpoint of like, ‘We’re all sinners. We all make mistakes. We shouldn’t point the finger at someone for the mistakes they’ve made or something like that.’ ”
Kanye West's Donda 2 is expected to drop on Feb. 22nd.

"Evan Rachel Wood violée par Marilyn Manson, le chanteur répond à ses accusations","Entre Evan Rachel Wood et Marilyn Manson, c'est la guerre. Après avoir vécu une histoire d'amour chaotique, les deux ex se déchirent. Après de longues années à se taire, l'actrice de Westworld a brisé le silence en février 2021. Sur Instagram, la jolie blonde a mis des mots sur ses maux. ""Il a horriblement abusé de moi"", a-t-elle expliqué, avant d'ajouter : ""Il m’a lavé le cerveau et manipulée jusqu’à la soumission"". À présent, elle réitère ses accusations et accuse le chanteur gothique, connu pour ses nombreux excès, de l'avoir violée sur le tournage d'un clip. L'interprète de Dolores dans la série de science-fiction s'est confiée dans un documentaire de HBO, intitulé Phoenix Rising et diffusé lors du festival de Sundance.
Les faits remonteraient en 2007, au cours du tournage d'un clip pour son single Heart-Shaped Glasses. ""Nous avions discuté d'une scène de sexe simulée. Mais une fois que les caméras ont tourné, il a commencé à me pénétrer pour de vrai"", a expliqué Evan Rachel Wood, avant de préciser : ""Je n'avais jamais accepté cela. Je ne savais pas comment me défendre ou dire non, parce que j'avais été conditionnée et formée pour ne jamais répondre, juste pour me battre."" Par ailleurs, l'actrice de Westworld a conclu : ""J'ai été contrainte à un acte sexuel commercial sous de faux prétextes... J'ai essentiellement été violée devant la caméra.""
Le rockeur dément les accusations d'Evan Rachel Wood
Si jusqu'à présent, Marilyn Manson n'avait pas réagi à la suite de ses accusations, c'est à présent chose faite. Sans grande surprise, le rocker a démenti les propos de l'actrice, dénonçant ""un mensonge éhonté"". Son avocat, Howard King, a déclaré à People : ""Ce n'est qu'un mensonge éhonté facile à discréditer, car il y a de multiples témoins. Mon client n'a pas couché avec Evan sur le tournage, et elle sait qu'il s'agit de la vérité (...) Evan était cohérente et investie pendant les trois jours d'enregistrement mais aussi très impliquée durant les semaines de pré-production et post-production pour faire le montage."" Pour conclure, il a expliqué : ""La scène de sexe simulée a été tournée des heures avec un grand nombre de prises, différents angles et plusieurs longues pauses entre les installations des caméras."" Cette défense est loin de faire l'unanimité, surtout que Marilyn Manson est accusé par plusieurs femmes de ""viols"" et ""agressions sexuelles avec violence"".",2022-01-27T13:49:59Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
Evan Rachel Wood,"“Las siguientes imágenes describe y representa violencia doméstica y abuso sexual. Se aconseja la discreción del espectador”. Así arranca el documental Phoenix Rising, una película dividida en dos capítulos (solo el primero se vio en el Festival de Sundance, los dos juntos se estrenarán en HBO Max este año), en la que la actriz Evan Rachel Wood se ha decidido a contar toda su historia como víctima y superviviente de su relación con el cantante Marilyn Manson entre 2006 y 2011.
La actriz de Westworld se presenta ante la cámara, sin maquillaje, al natural, aún temblando a veces al recordar, se le saltan las lágrimas incontrolables cuando empieza a enseñar fotos de ella misma antes de conocer a Manson. “Es difícil mirar fotos de mí antes de que hubiera pasado nada”, dice. Y el cariño y la pena se mezclan mientras muestra fotos con su primer novio, Jamie Bell.
Rachel Wood hacía años que hablaba de haber sido víctima de abusos, pero fue en febrero de 2021 cuando se decidió a dar el nombre de Manson. La atención mediática, la cantidad de amenazas y mensajes de otras víctimas del cantante que recibió le animó a poner en marcha este documental.
“Fui a Amy (Berg, la directora) desesperada por ser escuchada y para contar esta historia, para que la gente por fin preste atención a lo que contamos y cómo de serio es”, explicó después del pase oficial en el Festival. “Mi historia no es única, solo lo es porque ha estado bajo el foco, y ha recibido mucha atención virtual, pero todo lo demás es muy común”.
Evan Rachel Wood en Sundance. Cinemania
En el primer capítulo, la mayor revelación, en la que se han centrado todos los titulares estos días, es que Evan Rachel Wood cuenta que Manson la violó por primera vez delante de la cámara, cuando rodaban el videoclip Heart-Shaped Glasess. Su testimonio, cruzado con las imágenes del vídeo, es estremecedor. Ellos ya eran pareja, pero aún estaban en una fase reciente.
Todo el entorno de la actriz le dijo que no lo rodara, por lo explícito y violento que era sobre el papel. Pero ella, que solo tenía 19 años, enamorada y enganchada a este icono del rock que la hacía sentir especial, decidió seguir adelante. Habían hablado de una escena de sexo ficticia, cuando empezaron a rodar, Manson la penetró. Ella no pudo hacer nada, no supo qué hacer. Nadie en ese rodaje hizo nada. Como tampoco nadie la ayudó en la gira cuando él se ponía violento.
La denuncia de ese silencio cómplice del maltrato está presente en la película. Así como la responsabilidad que debe asumir la industria que permite y hasta alienta ciertos tipos de comportamientos e imágenes tóxicas. Como la que crearon alrededor de ella, cuando no tenía ni 15 años. A partir del estreno de Thirteen (2002), Hollywood y los medios empezaron a retratar a Evan Rachel Wood como una “adolescente problemática”, confundiendo personaje y realidad. “De ahí enseguida me pasaron a la Lolita”, dice ella.
Cuando aún era una adolescente, que además había estudiado siempre en casa, ""casi reprimida"", dice, había crecido en una familia con “amenaza de violencia constante”, hasta que sus padres se separaron y ella se marchó a Los Ángeles, dejando a su hermano atrás, dieron una imagen con la que ella no se sentía representada.
Ojalá la atención sobre el documental no se centre en esa revelación sobre el videoclip. Hay mucho más en el testimonio de Evan Rachel Wood. Mucho más dolor. Y, sobre todo, mucha más lucha. La actriz ha fundado junto a su amiga (y también víctima de Manson), Ilma Gore, la Phoenix Act Coalition, no solo para dar visibilidad a la violencia doméstica y protección a las víctimas, sino para conseguir cambios en las leyes.
En esa lucha consiguieron ampliar el estatuto de limitaciones en California que hacía que un delito de abuso sexual prescribiera entre uno y tres años de haber sucedido. Aunque ellas reclamaban ampliarlo a 10 años, lo dejaron entre tres y cinco años.
Rachel Wood y Gore están ahora recogiendo información de todas las víctimas de Manson que las han contactado, organizando pruebas propias y de otras para continuar en su lucha. Una lucha en la que espera que esta película le ayuda. “Es el momento de contar la verdad. De contar mi versión. No puedo dejar que la cuenten por mí y la gente creerá lo que quiera creer. No es mi trabajo convencerles. No miento. Mi trabajo es contar la verdad y es lo que he hecho. Es todo lo que puedo hacer”.",2022-01-27T07:00:00Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos
Marilyn Manson nega acusação de estupro feita por Evan Rachel Wood,"Fotos: Reprodução/Instagram
O cantor Marilyn Manson negou a acusação de estupro levantadas pela atriz Evan Rachel Wood, com quem ele teve um relacionamento de idas e vindas entre 2006 e 2010, quando chegou ao fim definitivamente. Em um documentário lançado recentemente, “Phoenis Rising”, Evan disse que o artista teria a estuprado durante as gravações do clipe “Heart-Shaped Glasses”, de 2007.
Segundo ela, Manson a “penetrou” de verdade durante uma cena de sexo que deveria ser simulada, contando que “nunca concordou” com a situação. De acordo com Wood, foi oferecido absinto a ela durante as gravações, e ela “mal estava consciente” na hora da cena em questão.

“Eu nunca concordei com isso! Era um caos completo e eu não me sentia segura, ninguém estava cuidando de mim. Eu me sentia nojenta”, ela falou no documentário.
Com a história contada por Evan, o advogado de Manson, Howard King, por sua vez, enviou ao jornal The Guardian na terça-feira, 25 de janeiro, com a posição do cantor sobre o caso.
De todas as acusações falsas que Evan Rachel Wood fez contra Brian Warner [nome de batismo de Manson], sua versão criativa das gravações do clipe de ‘Heart-Shaped Glass’ 15 anos atrás é a mais descarada e a mais fácil de refutar, já que houveram múltiplas testemunhas. Evan estava não apenas completamente coerente e envolvida durante os três dias de gravação, mas também muito comprometida nas semanas de pré e pós produção com planejamento e edição do corte final. A cena de sexo simulado durou diversas horas, com múltiplos takes em ângulos diferentes e com diversas pausas durante trocas de câmeras. Brian não teve relações sexuais com Evan naquele set e ela sabe que isso é verdade.
Vale lembrar que desde fevereiro de 2021, Evan acusa publicamente Mason, seu ex-namorado, de abuso sexual.

Evan Rachel Wood Doc Director Says She Was Stalked Online,"Marilyn Manson, real name Brian Warner. Photo: Isaac Brekken/WireImage
Amy Berg, director of Evan Rachel Wood’s new HBO documentary Phoenix Rising, said that she needed protection from online stalking during the production of the two-part film. The documentary explores accusations of domestic violence and sexual assault levied at Warner a.k.a. Marilyn Manson. In an interview with Billboard, Berg says that while she was working on Phoenix Rising, she “started receiving horror films in my Amazon account that I wasn’t ordering, and so I had to up the security with that.” Berg includes that she heard that other members of the production received “mysterious packages at their houses that they didn’t order,” but she doesn’t know if they came from Manson or his fans. “There’s a lot of like online stalking in that world, the Brian Warner world, so we had to take a look at that,” she says, adding that she had to “do double security.”
In December 2021, Wood declared in court that she has received threats from both “the alleged offender and his network of fanatics” and that she had to heighten security at home after Manson threatened her and her son. In Phoenix Rising, Wood claims that Manson raped her during the filming of the “Heart-Shaped Glasses” music video. Manson’s attorney called the claims “false” in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. Manson is currently at the center of three separate lawsuits for alleged sexual assault.",2022-01-26T16:45:10Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
"""Un mensonge éhonté facile à discréditer"" : Marilyn Manson répond à Evan Rachel Wood qui l'accuse de viol","Evan Rachel Wood réaffirme que Marilyn Manson l'a violée. L'actrice raconte comment son ex a abusé d'elle sur le tournage de l'un de ses clips, auquel elle participait.

Evan Rachel Wood,"Even before Evan Rachel Wood publicly named shock rocker Marilyn Manson as her alleged abuser for the first time in early 2021, she began working on a documentary that would incorporate her claims of surviving domestic violence at his hands, says director Amy Berg.
Berg (An Open Secret, Deliver Us From Evil), who knew Wood through friends, says the Westworld actor initially approached her in 2019 about potentially helming a film. At first, while Wood intended to name her former fiance Manson (née Brian Warner) in the project, the idea was to primarily spotlight how domestic violence can unfold and the fight to pass The Phoenix Act, a bill that extended the statute of limitations in California for domestic violence felonies and was signed into law in 2019.
Related A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson
But, as time passed and Berg officially joined the project as a director, Wood’s journey came to provide the film its “central narrative,” Berg says: “There was an investigation that was opened into Brian Warner and the story kind of got bigger and bigger, so we just followed that story.” (Manson has called Wood’s claims “horrible distortions of reality.”)
On Sunday, the first part of that documentary, Phoenix Rising, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival (the two-part film will debut in full on HBO later this year). Part one follows Wood’s rise in the industry, beginning as a child actor and gaining acclaim as an adolescent for roles as a precocious and troubled teen (Thirteen, Down in the Valley, Running With Scissors), and indicates how details from her past may have contributed to her eventual years-long relationship with Manson.
The day after the initial Sundance screening of part one, Berg spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how the film came together, the limits she faced as a filmmaker given an investigation into Manson, why she thinks Wood is “like Erin Brockovich” and what viewers can expect from the second half of the documentary.
First, how and why did you first come on board this documentary?
Evan Rachel Wood approached me in the spring of 2019 and she told me about The Phoenix Act and what she was working on in terms of trying to extend the statute of limitations in California [for domestic abuse survivors to press charges] and trying to further the investigation into her abuser and try to help to elevate the voices of other survivors of her perpetrator. And so we just kind of followed her around for the first year, to loosely watch things as they were unfolding. And then I became compelled to direct the film around the summer of 2020 and we’ve been going since then. We’re almost finished, we’re trying to finish up right now.
So you were initially not committed to directing Phoenix Rising — how did you decide to assume that role?
When she first approached me, I had just finished The Case Against Adnan Syed, which was a four-year production that was like, oh my God, talk about the pain of the end of that production, so I was just not in a great space to take something big on at the time. But after just following her progress, I mean, she’s like Erin Brockovich, she was changing laws in California and she was helping to elevate the voices of survivors, it was just very positive and there was a lot of story there and I was compelled to tell it as a director after about a year of that.
Given that this began in 2019, did Evan know that she wanted to name her alleged abuser in the film from the beginning, or was that a conclusion she came to over the course of production?
There was no question that she was going to name her abuser in the film. We spoke openly about him from the very beginning. But how and when she would do it publicly was definitely her choice, as it would be for any survivor to choose when they want to tell their story in that way.
In the beginning, Evan was very committed to making sure that people understood the stages of grooming and what abuse looks like in the domestic violence narrative. So we were very focused on The Phoenix Act and domestic violence as a story and only found this central narrative of just following her and her journey as the plot thickened, I should say. There was an investigation that was opened into Brian Warner and the story got bigger and bigger, so we just followed that story, which is mostly in the second half of this film. It’s much more active than the first half, if you could say it that way — I mean, the first half is mostly backstory and catching the audience up on where she was when we connected.
After Evan did name Manson in 2021, more claims and reports emerged. Did that new information present any particular challenges or opportunities for you in making this film?
Well, we were kind of behind the scenes throughout, so we knew a lot about the information that started to reveal itself to the public after that. Obviously when you are making a film about domestic abuse, any type of abuse, it’s up to the survivor to decide when they want to share their stories, so everything was very confidential with us as we were making the documentary. But Evan’s willingness to speak out elevated the voices of many other survivors that maybe wouldn’t have gotten that type of reception had she not spoke up. So she did it for them as much as for her.
Given that there is a Los Angeles County Sheriff investigation apparently underway of Manson, were sources for Phoenix Rising at all limited in what they could say or what materials they could provide to you?
Yeah, definitely. I mean, the case with the Sheriff’s Department is much more important than the film, obviously, so we told what we were able to tell and we hope that that investigation continues.
At one point in the film, artist and activist Illma Gore mentions safety concerns about keeping hard drives in her house. Did your production take any particular safety measures over the course of filming?
Yeah, I mean, they actually ended up getting a secure facility for their offices. They kept their own materials, we filmed what we needed to film, so we weren’t carrying the evidence or anything at any given point. So we didn’t have to worry about that so much. We had to deal with other types of security measures but not with their evidence: There’s a lot of like online stalking in that world, the Brian Warner world, so we had to take a look at that.
Anything you can mention specifically that you did regarding the online stalking?
I can say that I started receiving horror films in my Amazon account that I wasn’t ordering, and so I had to up the security with that. One of the things that we heard about while we were making this film was that people would just receive mysterious packages at their houses that they didn’t order, so I still don’t know if that was him or anything, but I had to do double security. I definitely was not ordering like 10 horror films between midnight and 6 a.m.
Given that Evan says in the film that during the making of the “Heart-Shaped Glasses” music video, she was “essentially raped” and was under the influence and couldn’t consent. What was behind the decision to show some clips from that video in the film — what were you hoping to convey?
Well, you need to see her face. She is completely out of it, and you need to see the extent of what the industry allowed to be circulating on the internet today. We had Evan’s blessing and permission to use that, but I think that is a moment that is really important to understand. I mean, that film set had a lot of people on it and that behavior is completely inappropriate and abusive and it’s rape, so we wanted to show it for what it was. She was just a child, she just turned 18.
There’s one moment in the documentary where Evan talks about experiencing violence in her family growing up and getting spanked and hit in the face, but it isn’t quite clear whether the violence she’s discussing goes beyond that. Can you clarify what the documentary means to express there?
She talked about violence in the household, [and] I think most of what was going on was the parental fighting. What we discussed was how you learn to love. For me, when she told me the story that included the line, “We fight because we love each other,” I really wanted that to be in the film because I think children are very impressionable and she felt there was a strong connection between how she learned to love and the choices she made with partners and being susceptible. And so it’s not just her parents and the fighting that they experienced, I think it was just the exposure to so much violence as she was growing up [that] maybe formulated an opinion for her, but that’s really more of a question for her. But I did just really connect with that line, it was very important for me to use that in the film.
When it came to distribution, did you shop it to a bunch of places or only a few, and did anyone say no? How did that process go?
Actually, like I said, I was just finishing up the Adnan Syed story, so I was speaking with Lisa [Heller] and Nancy [Abraham] frequently about what we would do together next, and this just seemed like the perfect project for all of us. So I didn’t shop it around or anything, I just brought it right to them.
Why did HBO seem like the right place, and did it have anything to do with its track record with distributing titles like On the Record and Leaving Neverland?
Well, probably all of that, but I wasn’t specifically thinking about that. I had a great experience with them on The Case Against Adnan Syed. And I find Lisa and Nancy and now Tina [Nguyen], who’s joined the team since I finished Adnan Syed, to be just great partners. So it felt like the right place, it was a safe place, as well as Evan has Westworld on HBO, so it seems kind of like an obvious match. But yeah, I love working with them, they’re great.
You spoke a little bit about what’s coming in part two of the documentary. Is there anything else you can share and can we expect any other survivors to appear as well?
Yeah, we interview a number of survivors in the second part. And it is faster-paced; it’s a lot of action. We’re really following the developments of the case and The Phoenix Act, so you should tune in.
Overall, with both parts, what are your hopes for the message viewers will receive?
Well, Evan’s intention was always to educate people and to elevate the voices of survivors. The statute of limitations is so short for any type of domestic violence or sexual abuse, it’s just such a short window, so the more information and education that is put out into the world about this kind of thing can hopefully encourage people to go for help earlier, so that it doesn’t have to take a movement to get something across.
If there are further major developments in this case, is this a story that you would want to revisit?
Not particularly. I feel like this was the film that I wanted to make, it got much bigger than even what I expected in the beginning, so I think that we’ll let the next group follow that story. But I’m very proud of this film and very happy with how it plays out and how it ends.
When did you first show Evan the documentary, and how did she react?
I showed her a couple of cuts throughout the process. She’s been an open book and she’s been very constructive with her notes, and she allowed us to tell the story we want to tell and has been very supportive.

Marilyn Manson Denies Evan Rachel Wood's Music Video Rape Claim,"Once again, Marilyn Manson has issued a statement denying allegations of sexual assault. The shock-rocker is at the forefront of an ongoing scandal where multiple women, including actresses like Evan Rachel Wood and Esmé Bianco, have accused him of rape, assault, and issuing threats. Wood has been vocal about her alleged interactions with her ex and even developed a documentary, Phoenix Rising, where she makes alarming allegations.
In the documentary, previewed at Sundance, Wood accused Manson of ""essentially"" raping her while they were on the set of one of his music videos. The actress dubbed it ""traumatizing"" and added that the production crew was ""uncomfortable."" After that soundbite went viral, Manson issued a statement via his attorney.

In Phoenix Rising, Wood reportedly said:
“We’re doing things that were not what was pitched to me. We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that. I’m a professional actress, I have been doing this my whole life, I’d never been on a set that unprofessional in my life up until this day. It was complete chaos, and I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me.”
“Of all the false claims that Evan Rachel Wood has made about Brian Warner, her imaginative retelling of the making of the 'Heart-Shaped Glasses' music video 15 years ago is the most brazen and easiest to disprove, because there were multiple witnesses,"" reads the statement. “Evan was not only fully coherent and engaged during the three-day shoot but also heavily involved in weeks of pre-production planning and days of post-production editing of the final cut.""
“The simulated sex scene took several hours to shoot with multiple takes using different angles and several long breaks in between camera setups,"" it continued. “Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.”
According to SPIN, Phoenix Rising will be available to the general public sometime this year.

Marilyn Manson nega ter estuprado Evan Rachel Wood em gravação de clipe,"O advogado de Marilyn Manson, Howard King, negou as alegações de que o cantor teria estuprado Evan Rachel Wood diante de câmeras no estúdio de filmagens do clipe Heart-Shaped Glasses, em 2007. Ele afirmou ainda que a atriz sabe da verdade e que havia várias testemunhas no local para comprovar.
""Tínhamos discutido uma cena de sexo simulada, mas, assim que as câmeras começaram a rodar, ele começou a me penetrar de verdade. Eu nunca tinha concordado com isso"", recorda Evan no documentário Phoenix Rising, cuja primeira parte foi exibida no Festival de Sundance no domingo (23).
""De todas as falsas alegações que Evan Rachel Wood fez sobre Brian Warner [nome verdadeiro de Marilyn Mason], sua releitura imaginativa da produção do videoclipe de 'Heart-Shaped Glasses', há 15 anos, é a mais descarada e fácil de refutar, porque havia várias testemunhas"", disse King ao jornal The Guardian nesta terça-feira (25)
""Evan não estava apenas engajada durante os três dias de filmagem, mas também fortemente envolvida em semanas de planejamento de pré-produção e dias de edição de pós-produção do corte final. A cena de sexo simulada levou várias horas para ser filmada com várias tomadas, usando diferentes ângulos e várias pausas longas entre as configurações da câmera"", complementou o advogado do artista.
De acordo com The Guardian, Evan e Manson começaram a namorar em 2006, quando ela tinha 18 anos, e ele, 38. Os dois tiveram um namoro ioiô por quatro anos. A gravação do clipe aconteceu em 2007. Na época, sites americanos levantaram o debate se o cantor estaria apenas encenando ou realmente fazendo sexo com a modelo.
""Sou uma atriz profissional. Tenho feito isso toda a minha vida. Nunca estive em um set tão pouco profissional. Era um caos completo, e eu não me sentia segura. Ninguém estava cuidando de mim. Foi uma experiência realmente traumatizante filmar o vídeo"", prossegue Evan no documentário da diretora Amy Berg, com estreia prevista na HBO para o segundo semestre.
""Não sabia como me defender ou dizer não porque eu tinha sido condicionada e treinada para nunca responder --para simplesmente seguir em frente. Eu me senti nojenta como se tivesse feito algo vergonhoso, e percebi que a equipe estava muito desconfortável e ninguém sabia o que fazer. Fui coagida a um ato sexual comercial sob falsos pretextos. Foi quando o primeiro crime foi cometido contra mim, e eu fui essencialmente estuprada diante das câmeras. ""
Escândalo estourou no ano passado
Em 2010, Manson pediu a mão dela em casamento durante um show em Paris. No mesmo ano, o relacionamento terminou. Em fevereiro de 2021, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood fez as primeiras acusações de abuso e violência doméstica contra o ex-noivo.
""O nome do meu abusador é Brian Warner, também conhecido mundialmente como Marilyn Manson. Ele começou a me assediar quando eu ainda era uma adolescente e abusou terrivelmente de mim por anos"", escreveu a atriz em seu perfil no Instagram à época.
""Passei por uma lavagem cerebral, fui manipulada para ser submissa. Estou cansada de viver com medo de retaliação, difamação ou chantagem. Estou aqui para expor esse homem perigoso e avisar a todas as indústrias que o apoiam, antes que ele destrua mais vidas. Estou ao lado das muitas vítimas que não vão mais ficar em silêncio"", completou.
Uma das primeiras manifestações da atriz foi em 2016 em uma entrevista à revista Rolling Stone e uma carta aberta publicada em seu perfil no Twitter. À época, contudo, ela revelou as situações de abuso, mas sem citar o nome de Manson.
Evan Rachel Wood está entre várias mulheres, incluindo a atriz de Game of Thrones Esmé Bianco, que acusa Manson de agressão sexual, abuso psicológico, violência ou intimidação. Segundo The Guardian, Manson negou as acusações feitas contra ele, chamando-as de ""horríveis distorções da realidade"". Ele disse que seus ""relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram inteiramente consensuais"".",2022-01-26T01:00:00Z,https://noticiasdatv.uol.com.br,Notícias da TV
"Evan Rachel Wood : elle accuse Marilyn Manson de l'avoir ""violée face caméra""","EVAN RACHEL WOOD. Evan Rachel Wood accuse son ex Marilyn Manson de l'avoir violée sur le tournage d'un clip en 2007. Ce ne sont pas les premières accusations d'abus sexuels qu'elle profère contre le chanteur.
[Mis à jour le 25 janvier 2022 à 15h31] Evan Rachel Wood accuse une nouvelle fois Marilyn Manson de viol. L'actrice avait déjà affirmé en 2018 puis en février 2021 que son ex-compagnon avait abusé d'elle sexuellement. Ces nouvelles accusations interviennent dans le cadre du documentaire biographique sur la comédienne, Phoenix Rising : elle assure que le chanteur l'a violée ""face caméra"" lors du tournage d'un clip en 2007, alors qu'ils étaient en couple. Ils ont rompu en 2010.
Evan Rachel Wood assure avoir été violée par le chanteur sur le tournage du clip ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand). Si l'on en croit la comédienne, la scène de sexe visible dans ce clip n'est pas simulée et elle n'en avait pas été prévenue. ""Nous avions parlé d'une scène de sexe simulée, mais lorsque les caméras ont commencé à tourner, il m'a pénétrée pour de vrai, assure-t-elle dans le documentaire, dans des propos rapportés par le magazine spécialisé Rolling Stone. Je n'avais jamais donné mon accord pour ça..."" Evan Rachel Wood assure également que le tournage de ce clip a été ""une expérience vraiment traumatisante [...] Je ressentais du dégoût pour moi-même, j'avais le sentiment d'avoir fait quelque chose de honteux [...] En gros, j'ai été violée face caméra.""
Ce n'est pas la première fois qu'Evan Rachel Wood prend la parole pour dénoncer des agissements de Marilyn Manson. En 2018, l'actrice de Westworld témoigne auprès de la Commission des affaires judiciaires de la Chambre des Représentants avoir été victime durant plusieurs années d'abus sexuels, psychologiques et physiques par un ex-petit ami. Elle explique à cette occasion souffrir d'un grave stress post-traumatique qui a eu un impact direct sur sa carrière. En février 2021, elle dévoile publiquement le nom de son agresseur présumé : il s'agit de Marilyn Manson, alias Brian Warner.
Evan Rachel Wood n'est pas la seule femme qui accuse Marilyn Manson d'abus. Au moins cinq femmes avaient accusé Brian Hugh Warner de viols ou de harcèlement en février 2021. Marilyn Manson a nié les accusations à son encontre, assurant sur son compte Instagram que ses ""relations intimes ont toujours été entièrement consenties, en accord avec mes partenaires. Peu importe la manière et les raisons que certaines d'entre elles choisissent aujourd'hui de représenter le passé, il s'agit de la vérité.""
Evan Rachel Wood est née en 1987 aux États-Unis, dans une famille d'artiste. Son père, Ira David Wood II, est comédien, chanteur, directeur de théâtre et metteur en scène. Sa mère et l'un de ses oncles sont eux aussi acteurs, et sa tante était costumière. Evan Rachel Wood a été élevée et éduquée par ses parents, elle a suivi presque toutes ses études à distance.
Durant son enfance, elle monte régulièrement sur les planches dans les pièces que son père met en scène. Dès sept ans, elle fait de petites apparitions dans des séries télévisées. Lorsqu'elle a neuf ans, ses parents divorcent et Evan Rachel Wood suit sa mère à Los Angeles. L'année suivante, elle joue dans ""Digging to China"", avec Kevin Bacon, puis ""Les Ensorceleuses"", avec Sandra Bullock. En 2001, on lui confie son premier grand rôle, dans ""La Gardienne des secrets"".

Mais c'est le film indépendant ""Thirteen"", l'année suivante, qui lance réellement sa carrière. Elle y joue une adolescente ordinaire, qui sous de mauvaises influences s'adonne à la drogue, au sexe et au vol. Ce rôle lui permet d'obtenir la consécration de la critique et de ses pairs, et lui ouvre en grand les portes du septième art.
Evan Rachel Wood tourne alors dans plusieurs films indépendants, où elle incarne souvent des personnages ambigus et un peu noirs, comme dans ""Pretty Persuasion"", histoire d'une adolescente perverse et manipulatrice. En 2006, on la voit dans ""Courir avec des ciseaux"", où elle donne la réplique à Gwyneth Paltrow et à Annette Bening. Woody Allen la fait jouer dans ""Whatever Works"" en 2007. Le film raconte l'amitié entre un sexagénaire new-yorkais et une adolescente fugueuse. En 2011, elle apparaît dans ""Les Marches du pouvoir"", un thriller réalisé par Georges Clooney, avec Ryan Gosling.
C'est à la télévision qu'Evan Rachel Wood signe son grand retour. Après être apparu dans quelques épisodes de la série ""Doll & Em"", l'actrice incarne Dolorès, l'un des rôles principaux de ""Westworld"". Cette série ambitieuse, à mi-chemin entre le western et la science-fiction, lui permet de renouer avec le public et la critique.
Evan Rachel Wood a été officiellement en couple avec Marilyn Manson de 2007 à 2010, même si leur relation aurait débuté un an auparavant. L'actrice avait 18 ans, le chanteur 37. Fiancés en 2010, ils rompent quelques mois plus tard. Par la suite, Evan Rachel Wood a fréquenté l'actrice Katherine Moenning, avant de se remettre en couple avec son ex, l'acteur de ""Billy Elliot"" Jamie Bell, en 2011. Le couple se dit ""oui"" l'année suivante, le 30 octobre 2012. Ils donnent naissance à un fils en juillet 2013. Ils se séparent l'année suivante. A ce jour, Evan Rachel Wood n'a pas officialisé de nouvelle relation.
En 2011, Evan Rachel Wood a effectué son coming-out, annonçant dans le magazine Esquire être bisexuelle : ""J'ai grandi en étant amoureuse de David Bowie. […] J'ai toujours été attirée par les androgynes. Les hommes, les femmes… J'aime l'androgynie dans son ensemble."" Sur son compte Twitter, l'année suivante, elle dénonce les discriminations dont sont victimes les personnes bisexuelles : "" pense que dans certains cas, les gens ont honte d'être bisexuels. Et cela doit s'arrêter. Je me suis assez battue avec moi-même pendant la majeure partie de ma vie parce que je n'étais pas assez homo ou hétéro.""",2022-01-25T14:31:00Z,https://www.linternaute.com,Linternaute.com
Kommer med nye anklager mot Marilyn Manson i HBO-serie,"GOD KVELD NORGE (TV 2): Evan Rachel Wood hevder en sexscene i musikkvideoen til én av Mansons låter var voldtekt.
I en ny dokumentar snakker skuespiller og sanger Evan Rachel Wood om de seksuelle overgrepene hun anklager ekskjæresten Marilyn Manson for, ifølge Cnn.
Hun er en av flere kvinner som har saksøkt artisten for blant annet seksuelle overgrep, psykisk terror og frihetsberøvelse. Manson, som egentlig heter Brian Warner, har tidligere avvist Woods anklager

Hevder hun ble voldtatt under innspilling
I dokumentaren «Phoenix Rising — Part I: Don't Fall», som vises på HBO senere i år, skal Wood anklage Manson for å ha voldtatt henne på settet til en musikkvideo, ifølge The Guardian.
Hun hevder overgrepet skal ha skjedd da Wood spilte en rolle i musikkvideoen til 2007-singelen hans «Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)».
Ifølge Wood skal artisten ha penetrert henne på ekte, uten samtykke, da de filmet en planlagt sexscene.
«Jeg hadde aldri gått med på det», skal hun ha sagt i dokumentaren.
Følte seg utrygg
Videre hevder hun at hun fikk servert alkohol på settet, som gjorde at hun nærmest var ute av stand til å protestere mot handlingen hun påstår artisten utsatte henne for. Hun hevder også at hun ikke følte seg trygg, og at ingen i prduksjonen passet på henne under innspillingen.
«Jeg ble tvunget til en kommersiell sexhandling under falske påskudd. Det var da den første forbrytelsen ble begått mot meg, og jeg ble i hovedsak voldtatt på kamera», sier hun i dokumentaren, ifølge The Guardian.
Wood hevder også at artisten ga henne klare instruksjoner om hvordan hun skulle omtale musikkvideoen til journalister.
«Jeg skulle fortelle folk at vi hadde denne flotte, romantiske tiden, og ingenting av det var sannheten», skal hun ha sagt.
«Men jeg var redd for å gjøre noe som ville opprøre Brian på noen måte. Videoen var bare begynnelsen på volden som fortsatte å eskalere i løpet av forholdet.»

Avviser anklagene
Ifølge Cnn har Marilyn Manson kommet med følgende uttalelse i forbindelse med dokumentaren «Phoenix Rising — Part I: Don't Fall», gjennom advokaten sin:
«Warner benekter på det sterkeste alle påstander om seksuelle overgrep eller overgrep mot noen. Disse skumle påstandene mot min klient har tre ting til felles - de er alle falske, påstått å ha funnet sted for mer enn et tiår siden, og er en del av et koordinert angrep fra tidligere partnere og medarbeidere av Mr. Warner, som har bevæpnet de ellers verdslige detaljene i hans personlige liv og deres samtykkende forhold til oppdiktede skrekkhistorier.»
Manson står overfor fire søksmål som anklager ham for seksuelle overgrep, vold og trakassering, samt en etterforskning av påstander om vold i hjemmet.
Etter at Vanity Fair publiserte en artikkel som beskriver den første anklagen mot han i februar 2021, ble artisten droppet av sitt eget plateselskap, Loma Vista.
Etter at anklagene mot han ble kjent, har han dukket opp på flere arrangementer i regi av rapperen Kanye West.",2022-01-25T14:06:38Z,https://www.tv2.no,TV 2
Evan Rachel Wood über Marilyn Manson - „Ich wurde quasi vor der Kamera vergewaltigt“,"Sie war damals 18, er 37 Jahre alt …
Die US-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood hat den Rock-Sänger Marilyn Manson der Vergewaltigung während eines Musikvideo-Drehs beschuldigt. Wood erhob die Vorwürfe in einer Dokumentation, die am Sonntag auf dem Sundance Film Festival in den USA Premiere hatte. Demnach sei eine „simulierte Sexszene“ für das Video zur 2007 erschienenen Hitsingle „Heart-Shaped Glasses“ abgesprochen gewesen. „Aber sobald die Kameras liefen, fing er an, mich wirklich zu penetrieren“, sagte Wood.
„Ich hatte dem nie zugestimmt“, betonte sie. Wood war 2006 mit Manson zusammengekommen. Manson sagte, er sei zu „Heart-Shaped Glasses“ inspiriert worden, als er Wood mit der Brille sah, die auf dem berühmten Filmplakat von Stanley Kubricks „Lolita“ abgebildet war.
„Ich wusste nicht, wie ich für mich selbst eintreten oder Nein sagen sollte, weil ich darauf konditioniert und trainiert worden war, nie zu widersprechen und mich einfach durchzukämpfen“, sagte Wood, die Darstellerin in der beliebten US-Fernsehserie „Westworld“ ist. „Ich merkte, dass sich die Crew sehr unwohl fühlte und niemand wusste, was er tun sollte.“
Sie sei „unter Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen zu einem kommerziellen Sexualakt gezwungen“ worden, sagte sie in der Dokumentation. „Ich wurde quasi vor der Kamera vergewaltigt.“ Dem Dokumentarfilm zufolge setzte Manson, mit bürgerlichem Namen Brian Warner, Wood später unter Druck, Journalisten zu sagen, dass es während der Dreharbeiten zu dem Video keinen echten Sex gegeben habe.

"""Il m'a pénétrée pour de vrai"" : Evan Rachel Wood accuse son ex Marilyn Manson de l'avoir violée en plein tournage","Dans le documentaire Phoenix Rising, diffusé sur HBO, Evan Rachel Wood accuse Marilyn Manson de l'avoir violée lors du tournage d'un clip, en 2007.
""J'ai été violée devant une caméra"". C'est un nouveau témoignage poignant que livre Evan Rachel Wood. Quelques mois après avoir accusé Marilyn Manson de l'avoir sexuellement abusée durant leur relation, la comédienne s'est confiée dans le documentaire Phoenix Rising, diffusé sur HBO. Dans celui-ci, celle que l'on a notamment vue dans la série Westworld revient sur le tournage du clip de Heart-Shaped Glasses, en 2007. Invitée par son compagnon d'alors à participer à cette production, Evan Rachel Wood l'accuse de viol. ""Nous avions parlé d'une scène de sexe simulé. Mais quand les caméras tournaient, il a commencé à me pénétrer pour de vrai"", explique l'actrice dans ce documentaire, qui montre la lutte visant à augmenter le délai de prescription en cas de crimes sexuels pour permettre aux victimes d'obtenir justice.
""Je n'avais jamais donné mon accord pour ça"", ajoute Evan Rachel Wood, qui raconte n'avoir ""pas su dire non"" car elle avait ""été conditionnée et formée à ne jamais répondre, à aller au bout coûte que coûte"" depuis son enfance. ""J'ai été contrainte à un acte sexuel commercial sous un prétexte fallacieux. (...) J'ai été violée devant une caméra, accuse-t-elle. C'était un chaos total. Je ne me sentais pas en sécurité. Personne ne me protégeait. Tourner ce clip a été une expérience vraiment traumatisante. Je peux dire que l'équipe était très embarrassée et que personne ne savait quoi faire."" Selon le documentaire de HBO, Marilyn Manson aurait fait pression sur Evan Rachel Wood pour qu'elle assure aux journalistes qu'il n'y avait pas eu de scène de sexe réel durant le tournage de son clip.
Marilyn Manson : le chanteur fait l'objet d'une enquête
""Je devais dire que nous avions eu une super expérience romantique, et rien de tout cela n'était vrai. Mais j'avais peur d'énerver Brian (Hugh Warner, le vrai nom de Marilyn Manson, ndlr). La vidéo n'a été que le début de la violence qui n'a fait qu'augmenter au cours de notre relation"", assure Evan Rachel Wood. Un nouveau témoignage terrifiant qui s'ajoute aux nombreux que l'actrice a faits ces derniers mois. Marilyn Manson, qui nie en bloc les accusations de la comédienne et d'autres femmes, fait l'objet d'une enquête diligentée par la police de Los Angeles. Les accusations ""de violence dans le cadre du couple impliquant M. Brian Warner"" et faisant l'objet d'une enquête ""se sont produits entre 2009 et 2011, quand M. Warner habitait la ville de West Hollywood"", a précisé la police dans un communiqué.

La actriz estadounidense Evan Rachel Wood acusó al rockero Marilyn Manson de violarla ante la cámara durante la filmación del video musical de su exitoso sencillo de 2007 'Heart-Shaped Glasses'. Wood hizo las acusaciones -que Manson niega- en el documental de HBO 'Phoenix Rising', que se estrenó en el festival de cine de Sundance.
« Habíamos discutido una escena de sexo simulada. Pero una vez que las cámaras estaban rodando, comenzó a penetrarme de verdad», dijo la estrella de la serie de televisión 'Westworld'. «Nunca accedí a eso». Wood comenzó a salir con Manson, cuyo nombre real es Brian Warner, en 2006, cuando ella tenía 18 años y él 37.
Manson dijo que la canción 'Heart-Shaped Glasses' estaba inspirada en la imagen de Wood usando las gafas con forma de corazón que se hicieron famosas en el póster de la película 'Lolita', de Stanley Kubrick.
«No sabía cómo defenderme ni sabía cómo decir que no, porque me habían condicionado y entrenado para no responder nunca, solo para seguir adelante», dijo Wood. «Me di cuenta de que el equipo estaba muy incómodo y nadie sabía qué hacer». «Fui forzada a participar en un acto sexual comercial con falsos pretextos... Básicamente me violaron frente a la cámara».
Según el documental, posteriormente Manson presionó a Wood para que les dijera a los periodistas que no había habido sexo real durante la filmación del video.
La madre de Wood recuerda haber escuchado de boca de un integrante del equipo de filmación que Manson le estaba dando licor de absenta a Wood «y cualquier otra cosa», y que ella no estaba en condiciones de dar su consentimiento cuando él se salió del guión. El abogado de Manson, Howard King, negó la acusación en un comunicado enviado a AFP.
«De todas las falsas acusaciones que Evan Rachel Wood ha hecho sobre Brian Warner, su recuento imaginario del rodaje del video de 'Heart-Shaped Glasses' hace 15 años es la más descarada y fácil de refutar porque había varios testigos», escribió.
King dijo que Wood estaba «totalmente coherente» durante el rodaje de tres días y «profundamente involucrada en la planificación de la preproducción y posproducción del clip». «La escena de sexo simulado requirió varias horas de rodaje con varias tomas usando diferentes ángulos y pausas largas entre cámaras». «Brian no tuvo sexo con Evan en aquel set, y ella sabe que esa es la verdad».
Manson ha sido acusado por varias mujeres de agresión sexual, entre ellas la actriz de 'Game of Thrones' Esme Bianco. La policía de Los Ángeles confirmó el año pasado que estaban investigando acusaciones de violencia doméstica contra el cantante.
Manson, quien durante mucho tiempo ha cultivado una imagen polémica con su maquillaje fantasmal y un nombre artístico que evoca al asesino en serie Charles Manson, se separó de su sello discográfico Loma Vista Recordings y de la agencia de Hollywood CAA desde que se hicieron públicas las acusaciones.
Pero continúa grabando música y el año pasado participó en el álbum 'Donda' de Kanye West. El documental 'Phoenix Rising' repasa los esfuerzos de Wood y otras sobrevivientes de abusos sexuales para extender el plazo de prescripción de estos delitos y disponer de más tiempo para buscar justicia después del abuso.

"Evan Rachel Wood violée par Marilyn Manson lors du tournage d’un clip, elle fait de nouvelles confidences chocs","C'est une histoire qui fait froid dans le dos. Marilyn Manson est au coeur d'un nouveau scandale. Connu pour ses frasques et ses excès, le chanteur gothique n'a pas fini de faire parler de lui. Entre l'artiste et son ex, Evan Rachel Wood, c'est la guerre. Si le duo a formé en 2006 un couple tumultueux, à présent, ils n'hésitent plus à se déchirer. Il y a quelques mois, l'actrice de Westworld était sortie de son silence et avait accusé Marilyn Manson, de son vrai nom Brian Hugh Warner, de l'avoir agressée physiquement et sexuellement. Des accusations qu'elle réitère, en allant encore plus loin.
Evan Rachel Wood a accusé le rockeur gothique Marilyn Manson de l'avoir violée devant la caméra lors du tournage d'un clip pour son single Heart-Shaped Glasses en 2007. L'actrice américaine a fait ces allégations glaçantes dans le documentaire de HBO Phoenix Rising, qui a été présenté en première au festival du film de Sundance. ""Nous avions discuté d'une scène de sexe simulée. Mais une fois que les caméras ont tourné, il a commencé à me pénétrer pour de vrai"", a-t-elle déclaré, avant de poursuivre : ""Je n'avais jamais accepté cela. Je ne savais pas comment me défendre ou dire non, parce que j'avais été conditionnée et formée pour ne jamais répondre, juste pour me battre.""
Un témoignage glaçant
L'interprète de Dolores dans la série à succès Westworld a également ajouté : ""Je peux dire que l'équipe de tournage était très mal à l'aise et que personne ne savait quoi faire."" Puis, elle a affirmé : ""J'ai été contrainte à un acte sexuel commercial sous de faux prétextes... J'ai essentiellement été violée devant la caméra."" Selon le documentaire, Marilyn Manson a ensuite fait pression sur Evan Rachel Wood pour qu'elle dise aux journalistes qu'il n'y avait pas eu de relations sexuelles réelles pendant le tournage de la vidéo. Pour le moment, les représentants du musicien n'ont pas réagi, mais ce n'est pas la première fois que le chanteur est accusé de viols et d'agressions sexuelles par des femmes. Il avait même été viré d'American Gods et de Creepshow pour cette raison.",2022-01-25T10:58:33Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
Marilyn Manson accusé de viol : un nouveau témoignage d'Evan Rachel Wood,"MARILYN MANSON. L'actrice Evan Rachel Wood accuse le chanteur Marilyn Manson de l'avoir violée sur le tournage d'un clip en 2007.
Marilyn Manson accablé. Le chanteur controversé est (de nouveau) accusé de viol par l'actrice Evan Rachel Wood. Dans le documentaire HBO Phoenix Rising, présenté à l'occasion du festival américain de Sundance, cette dernière révèle que Marilyn Mason aurait abusé d'elle profitant du tournage du clip Heart-Sheaped Glasses, en 2007. A cette époque, elle était en couple avec l'artiste.
""Nous avions parlé d'une scène de sexe simulé. Mais quand les caméras tournaient, il a commencé à me pénétrer réellement"", explique face caméra Evan Rachel Wood, affirmant ""ne jamais avoir donné [s]on accord pour ça."" L'actrice raconte qu'elle ""n'a pas du dire non"", car elle avait ""été été conditionnée et formée à ne jamais répondre, à aller au bout coûte que coûte.""
""J'ai été contrainte à un acte sexuel commercial sous un prétexte fallacieux (…) J'ai été violée face caméra. Je peux dire que l'équipe était très embarrassée et personne ne savait quoi faire"", ajoute-t-elle. Evan Rachel Wood, connue notamment pour son rôle dans la série Westworld, avait déjà accusé Marilyn Manson en 2021 s'avoir abusé d'elle pendant qu'ils étaient en couple, de 2006 à 2010. L'actrice expliquait alors avoir été soumise à ""d'horribles abus durant des années"".
Marilyn Manson, de son vrai nom Brian Hugh Warner, est né le 5 janvier 1969 à Canton aux Etats-Unis. Scolarisé dans un établissement épiscopalien, Brian Warner se passionne très tôt pour le rock et devient fan d'AC/DC et de Kiss. A dix-huit ans, il déménage en Floride et entreprend des études de journalisme et de théâtre. En 1989, il décide de former un groupe avec le guitariste Scott Putesky et prend son nom de scène, Marilyn Manson, en référence à Marilyn Monroe et au tueur en série Charles Manson. Le groupe, qui se baptise Marilyn Manson & The Spooky Kids, se construit dans le refus de l'Amérique puritaine. Sa musique est classée dans le rock alternatif.
En 1992, le groupe se rebaptise Marilyn Manson. Son premier album, Portrait of an American Family, sort en 1994. Viennent ensuite Smells Like Children en 1995, Antichrist Superstar en 1996, Mechanical Animals en 1998, Holy Wood en 2000, The Golden Age of Grotesque en 2003, Eat Me, Drink Me en 2007, The High End of Low en 2009, Born Villain en 2012, The Pale Emperor en 2015, Heaven Upside Down en 2017 et enfin, WE ARE CHAOS en 2020.
Outre la musique, Marilyn Manson s'est essayé à d'autres domaines. Egérie de la collection de prêt-à-porter printemps-été 2014 de Saint Laurent, Marilyn Manson a tourné dans plusieurs films. En 1997, il décroche le rôle d'une star du porno dans Lost Highway, le film de David Lynch. Interviewé par Michael Moore dans son documentaire Bowling for Columbine en 2002), Marilyn Manson tourne notamment dans le film Le Livre de Jérémie, réalisé par Asia Argento en 2004.
Contre Marilyn Manson, la liste des accusations s'allonge encore. Plusieurs mois après la déferlante d'allégations de violences sexuelles de plusieurs femmes, dont l'actrice Evan Rachel Wood, c'est au tour de la mannequin Ashley Morgan Smithline de livrer un témoignage glaçant, accusant le chanteur controversé de viol, traite d'humain et séquestration.
Dans sa plainte, relayée par le site Rolling Stone et qui fait suite à une interview vidéo accordée au site People, l'Américaine raconte avoir rencontré l'artiste en 2010. Ashley Morgan Smithline relate l'emprise qu'aurait eue Marilyn Manson sur elle dès le début de leur relation, qui était consentie dans un premier temps. Dans son entretien au site People, la mannequin racontait ""qu'elle s'est réveillée un jour d'un état d'inconscience, avec les poignets et les chevilles liés et que Warner (Brian Warner est le vrai nom de Marilyn Manson ndlr.) la pénétrait. Quand elle lui a dit d'arrêter, il lui a dit de ""la fermer."" Elle dit avoir été blessée aux côtes et au vagin. 'Il n'arrêtait pas de me dire : 'On ne peut pas violer une personne dont on est amoureux'."".
Dans sa plainte, Ashley Morgan Smithline affirme avoir été battue plusieurs fois par Marilyn Manson, qui lui aurait, selon son récit, gravé un ""MM"", toujours visible, sur la cuisse. Elle raconte avoir plusieurs fois voulu s'enfuir, mais que l'artiste la menaçait de la tuer si elle le faisait. ""Nous démentons fermement la plainte de madame Smithline"", répond l'artiste dans un communiqué transmis au site Rolling Stone ce 30 juin. Au total, une douzaine de femmes accusent Marilyn Manson de violences sexuelles.
Après le témoignage de l'actrice Evan Rachel Wood sur Instagram, accusant le chanteur de violences sexuelles, plusieurs autres femmes avaient déjà pris la parole en début d'année pour dénoncer des faits similaires. Evan Rachel Wood, connue notamment pour son rôle dans la série Westworld, dénonçait assure avoir été ""manipulée psychologiquement"" par Marilyn Manson quand elle avait 20 ans et soumise à d'horribles abus durant des années"".
Après son témoignage, largement relayé sur les réseaux sociaux, Ashley Walters, Gabriella, Ashley Lindsay Morgan et Sarah McNeilly ont à leur tour détaillé dans des communiqués leurs expériences et affirment avoir subi des ""agressions sexuelles, de maltraitances psychologiques ou de diverses formes de contraintes, de violences et d'intimidation"", peut-on lire dans les colonnes du site américain Vanity Fair. L'artiste controversé avait déjà fait l'objet d'accusations de la sorte dans le passé, accusations qu'il avait toujours nié.
Au lendemain de cette prise de parole, Marilyn Manson s'était finalement exprimé, lui aussi sur son compte Instagram. ""Évidemment, mon art et ma vie attirent depuis longtemps la controverse, mais ces récentes allégations contre moi sont d'horribles déformations de la réalité. Mes relations intimes ont toujours été entièrement consenties, avec des partenaires en accord. Peu importe comment et pourquoi d'autres choisissent aujourd'hui de déformer le passé, c'est la vérité"", écrivait-il dans un court texte.
A noter que son label Loma Vista Recordings, avec qui il avait sorti un dernier album en 2020, annonçait à la suite de ces allégations avoir cessé son travail avec le chanteur. ""À la lumière des allégations troublantes d'aujourd'hui de la part d'Evan Rachel Wood et d'autres femmes nommant Marilyn Manson comme leur agresseur, Loma Vista cessera de promouvoir son album actuel, avec effet immédiat. En raison de ces développements préoccupants, nous avons également décidé de ne pas travailler avec Marilyn Manson sur de futurs projets"", pouvait-on lire dans un communiqué publié début février 2021.
Une fois de plus, le séisme est venu des réseaux sociaux. Dans une publication postée sur Instagram le 1er février 2021, l'actrice Evan Rachel Wood accuse le chanteur Marylin Manson de violences sexuelles. ""Le nom de mon agresseur est Brian Warner, connu par le monde entier sous le nom de Marilyn Manson. Il a commencé par gagner ma confiance quand j'étais adolescente et m'a maltraitée durant des années. Il m'a lavé le cerveau et manipulée pour que je me soumette. Je veux dénoncer cet homme dangereux et les nombreuses industries qui l'ont laissé faire, avant qu'il ne ruine d'autres vies. Je suis aux côtés des nombreuses victimes qui ne seront plus silencieuses"", écrit la comédienne.
La vie privée de Marilyn Manson a souvent fait les choux gras de la presse à scandale outre-Atlantique. De 1997 à 2001, le chanteur fréquente l'actrice Rose McGowan, devenue aujourd'hui l'un des visages du féminisme et de la libération de la parole. En 2001, Marylin Manson s'affiche avec Dita von Teese, qu'il épouse en 2005, puis divorce en 2006.
C'est l'année suivante qu'il fait plusieurs apparitions publiques avec Evan Rachel Wood, alors âgée de 20 ans, qui apparaît d'ailleurs dans son clip Heart-Shaped. Le couple se sépare en 2010 après s'être fiancé. L'actrice dit avoir été soumise à ""d'horribles abus durant des années"". Sans nommer son bourreau, Evan Rachel Wood avait déjà témoigné en 2018 devant la Commission des affaires judiciaires de la Chambre des représentants, évoquant son long calvaire de victime d'abus psychologiques et physiques. Elle avait également affirmé avoir été violée à plusieurs reprises.
Après son histoire avec Evan Rachel Wood, Marilyn Manson fait la connaissance de Lindsay Usich, ancienne mannequin devenue photographe et peintre, de seize ans sa cadette. Ensemble depuis, ils se seraient mariés durant le confinement. Tous deux avaient d'ailleurs fait une apparition publique quelques semaines plus tôt sur le tapis rouge des Oscars en février 2020.",2022-01-25T10:30:00Z,https://www.linternaute.com,Linternaute.com
Evan Rachel Wood nennt Details zum Missbrauch durch Marilyn Manson,"In den Missbrachsvorwürfen gegen Skandal-Rocker Marilyn Manson sind neue Details ans Licht gekommen. Dabei geht es um einen Vorfall, der sich bereits vor 14 Jahren ereignet haben soll.
Nach Aussagen der US-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood hat Marilyn Manson sie vor laufender Kamera während eines Musikvideo-Drehs vergewaltigt. Wood erhob die Vorwürfe in einer Dokumentation, die am Sonntag auf dem Sundance Film Festival in den USA Premiere hatte. Demnach sei eine „simulierte Sexszene“ für das Video zur 2007 erschienenen Hitsingle „Heart-Shaped Glasses“ abgesprochen gewesen. An die abgesprochenen Abläufe habe sich der Sänger aber nicht gehalten.
„Fing an, mich wirklich zu penetrieren“
„Sobald die Kameras liefen, fing er an, mich wirklich zu penetrieren“, sagte Wood. „Ich hatte dem nie zugestimmt“, betonte sie. Wood war 2006 im Alter von 18 Jahren mit Manson, damals 37, zusammengekommen. Die Beziehung hielt bis 2010.
„Ich wusste nicht, wie ich für mich selbst eintreten oder nein sagen sollte, weil ich darauf konditioniert und trainiert worden war, nie zu widersprechen und mich einfach durchzukämpfen“, sagte Wood nun zu dem Vorfall beim Videodreh.
Mehrere Frauen erheben schwere Vorwürfe gegen Manson
Woods erhob bereits Anfang Februar 2021 schwere Anschuldigungen. Mehrere Frauen, darunter auch die „Game of Thrones“-Darstellerin Esme Bianco, berichteten daraufhin über eigene Erfahrungen des sexuellen Missbrauchs durch Manson.
Knapp ein Jahr nach ihrem ersten Statement geht Wood nun ins Detail: „Ich merkte, dass sich die Crew sehr unwohl fühlte und niemand wusste, was er tun sollte.“ Sie sei „unter Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen zu einem kommerziellen Sexualakt gezwungen“ worden, sagte sie in der Dokumentation. „Ich wurde quasi vor der Kamera vergewaltigt.“
Mansons Anwalt Howard King wies die Behauptung in einer Erklärung entschieden zurück. „Von allen falschen Behauptungen, die Evan Rachel Wood über Brian Warner aufgestellt hat, ist ihre phantasievolle Nacherzählung über die Entstehung des Musikvideos 'Heart-Shaped Glasses' vor 15 Jahren die dreisteste und am leichtesten zu widerlegen, da es mehrere Zeugen gab“, schrieb er.
Untersuchungen gegen Marilyn Manson laufen bereits
Die Polizei von Los Angeles hatte vergangenes Jahr bestätigt, dass sie Anschuldigungen wegen häuslicher Gewalt gegen den Sänger untersuchte. Manson hatte sich nach Bekanntwerden der Vorwürfe von seiner Plattenfirma Loma Vista Recordings und seiner Agentur CAA getrennt. Auf Instagram hatte er die Vorwürfe als „schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität“ bezeichnet und war seitdem auf der Social-Media-Plattform nicht mehr aktiv. Er nimmt aber weiterhin Musik auf und wirkte vergangenes Jahr auf Kanye Wests Album „Donda“ mit.

Zu den neuen Details hat er sich persönlich bislang nicht geäußert. Die HBO-Dokumentation „Phoenix Rising“ schildert die Bemühungen von Wood und anderen Überlebenden sexueller Übergriffe, die Verjährungsfrist für Sexualverbrechen zu verlängern, um Frauen mehr Zeit zu geben, nach einem Missbrauch Gerechtigkeit zu suchen. Das Sundance-Filmfestival, das dieses Jahr wegen der Corona-Pandemie erneut online stattfindet, läuft noch bis zum 30. Januar.

Evan Rachel Wood : elle accuse Marilyn Manson de viol sur un tournage,"EVAN RACHEL WOOD. L'ex du chanteur Marilyn Manson, qui l'avait déjà accusé d'abus sexuels par le passé, affirme aujourd'hui avoir été violée sur le tournage d'un de ses clips en 2007.
[Mis à jour le 25 janvier 2022 à 10h02] Evan Rachel Wood a proféré de nouvelles accusations de viol contre son ex-compagnon, Marilyn Manson. Alors qu'elle avait déjà affirmé que le chanteur avait abusé d'elle alors qu'ils étaient en couple, elle a assuré au cours du documentaire biographique Phoenix Rising que son ex l'avait violée lors du tournage d'un clip en 2007. Evan Rachel Wood et Marilyn Manson ont commencé une relation amoureuse alors que la star de Westworld avait 18 ans, et que le chanteur en avait 37, en 2006. Leur relation s'achève quatre ans plus tard.
Evan Rachel Wood assure avoir été violée par le chanteur sur le tournage du clip ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand). Si l'on en croit la comédienne, la scène de sexe visible dans ce clip n'est pas simulée et elle n'en avait pas été prévenue. ""Nous avions parlé d'une scène de sexe simulée, mais lorsque les caméras ont commencé à tourner, il m'a pénétrée pour de vrai, assure-t-elle dans le documentaire, dans des propos rapportés par le magazine spécialisé Rolling Stone. Je n'avais jamais donné mon accord pour ça..."" Evan Rachel Wood assure également que le tournage de ce clip a été ""une expérience vraiment traumatisante [...] Je ressentais du dégoût pour moi-même, j'avais le sentiment d'avoir fait quelque chose de honteux [...] En gros, j'ai été violée face caméra.""
Ce n'est pas la première fois qu'Evan Rachel Wood prend la parole pour dénoncer des agissements de Marilyn Manson. En 2018, l'actrice de Westworld témoigne auprès de la Commission de affaires judiciaires de la Chambre des Représentants avoir été victime d'abus psychologiques et physiques. En février 2021, elle dévoile publiquement le nom de son agresseur présumé : il s'agit de Marilyn Manson, alias Brian Warner. Marilyn Manson a nié les accusations.
Evan Rachel Wood est née en 1987 aux États-Unis, dans une famille d'artiste. Son père, Ira David Wood II, est comédien, chanteur, directeur de théâtre et metteur en scène. Sa mère et l'un de ses oncles sont eux aussi acteurs, et sa tante était costumière. Evan Rachel Wood a été élevée et éduquée par ses parents, elle a suivi presque toutes ses études à distance. Durant son enfance, elle monte régulièrement sur les planches dans les pièces que son père met en scène. Dès sept ans, elle fait de petites apparitions dans des séries télévisées. Lorsqu'elle a neuf ans, ses parents divorcent et Evan Rachel Wood suit sa mère à Los Angeles. L'année suivante, elle joue dans ""Digging to China"", avec Kevin Bacon, puis ""Les Ensorceleuses"", avec Sandra Bullock. En 2001, on lui confie son premier grand rôle, dans ""La Gardienne des secrets"".
Mais c'est le film indépendant ""Thirteen"", l'année suivante, qui lance réellement sa carrière. Elle y joue une adolescente ordinaire, qui sous de mauvaises influences s'adonne à la drogue, au sexe et au vol. Evan Rachel Wood tourne alors dans plusieurs films indépendants, où elle incarne souvent des personnages ambigus et un peu noirs, comme dans ""Pretty Persuasion"", histoire d'une adolescente perverse et manipulatrice.
En 2006, on la voit dans ""Courir avec des ciseaux"", où elle donne la réplique à Gwyneth Paltrow et à Annette Bening. Woody Allen la fait jouer dans ""Whatever Works"" en 2007. Le film raconte l'amitié entre un sexagénaire new-yorkais et une adolescente fugueuse. En 2011, elle apparaît dans ""Les Marches du pouvoir"", un thriller réalisé par Georges Clooney, avec Ryan Gosling.",2022-01-25T09:02:04Z,https://www.linternaute.com,Linternaute.com
Wood bei Dreh vergewaltigt?: Neue Anschuldigung gegen Marilyn Manson,"Beim Sundance Festival feiert eine Doku Premiere, in der Evan Rachel Wood neue Anschuldigungen gegen Marilyn Manson äußert. Der Rockmusiker soll seine Ex während eines Videodrehs vor laufender Kamera vergewaltigt haben, statt den Sex für diese Szene nur zu simulieren.
Vor fast genau einem Jahr hat sich Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood mit schweren Missbrauchsvorwürfen gegen Ex-Freund Marilyn Manson an die Öffentlichkeit gewandt. Mehrere weitere Frauen meldeten sich daraufhin mit ähnlichen Anschuldigungen ebenfalls zu Wort. Eine neue Doku namens ""Phoenix Rising"", die beim renommierten Sundance Filmfestival Premiere feierte, lieferte nun weitere Details über Woods angeblich gewaltsame Beziehung zu dem Schockrocker. Das berichtet unter anderem die Musik-Branchenseite ""Rolling Stone"".
Demnach sei sie im Jahr 2007 während des Drehs des Musikvideos zum Song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"" vor laufender Kamera vergewaltigt worden. In einer ""simulierten Sexszene"" sei Manson ""wirklich in mich eingedrungen"", erinnert sich Wood an das traumatische Erlebnis zurück. ""Ich habe dem nie zugestimmt"", so der ""Westworld""-Star weiter. Kurz zuvor war die Beziehung der beiden öffentlich geworden. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war sie 18 Jahre alt, er 38.
Mit Absinth gefügig gemacht
In ""Phoenix Rising"" erzählt die heute 34-Jährige: ""Ich wurde unter falschen Angaben zu einem kommerziellen Sexakt gezwungen. Damals wurde die erste Straftat gegen mich verübt - ich wurde wortwörtlich vor der Kamera vergewaltigt."" Ferner gibt Wood laut des Berichts in der Doku an, dass ihr während ihrer Zeit am Set Absinth verabreicht worden sei, eine Spirituose mit hohem Alkoholanteil. Sie sei in dieser Zeit ""kaum bei Bewusstsein"" gewesen, heißt es weiter. Die gesamte Filmcrew habe sich ""unwohl gefühlt, und niemand wusste, was zu tun ist.""
Außerdem sei sie von Brian Warner, wie der Musiker mit bürgerlichem Namen heißt, daraufhin unter Druck gesetzt worden, ihre Beziehung gegenüber Journalisten als ""romantisch"" zu bezeichnen. Die Realität sah ihr zufolge anders aus: ""Das Video war erst der Anfang der Gewalt, die im Laufe der Beziehung immer weiter eskalieren sollte."" Bis 2010 waren die beiden dennoch zusammen - weil ihr ""eine Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und sie zu Gehorsam manipuliert wurde.""
Seit die ersten Vorwürfe vor gut einem Jahr laut geworden waren, wies der 53-jährige Marilyn Manson sie kategorisch von sich. Seiner Aussage nach seien die ""intimen Beziehungen stets einvernehmlich gewesen.""",2022-01-25T08:48:32Z,https://www.n-tv.de,n-tv NACHRICHTEN

Evan Rachel Wood: Beschuldigt Ex-Freund Marilyn Manson der Vergewaltigung,"Mehrere Frauen werfen dem US-Rocker Marilyn Manson sexuelle Übergriffe vor. Ex-Freundin Evan Rachel Wood sagt nun, der Sänger habe sie während eines Videodrehs vergewaltigt. Mansons Anwalt weist das zurück.

Die US-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood hat den Rock-Sänger Marilyn Manson der Vergewaltigung bei einem Musikvideo-Dreh beschuldigt. Wood erhob die Vorwürfe in einer Dokumentation, die am Sonntag auf dem Sundance Film Festival in den USA Premiere hatte. Demnach sei eine „simulierte Sexszene“ für das Video zur 2007 erschienenen Hitsingle „Heart-Shaped Glasses“ abgesprochen gewesen. „Aber sobald die Kameras liefen, fing er an, mich wirklich zu penetrieren“, sagte Wood.
„Ich hatte dem nie zugestimmt“, betonte sie. Wood war 2006 mit Manson zusammengekommen. Sie war damals 18 und er 37 Jahre alt. Manson sagte, er sei zu „Heart-Shaped Glasses“ inspiriert worden, als er Wood mit der Brille sah, die auf dem berühmten Filmplakat von Stanley Kubricks „Lolita“ abgebildet war.
„Ich wusste nicht, wie ich für mich selbst eintreten oder nein sagen sollte, weil ich darauf konditioniert und trainiert worden war, nie zu widersprechen und mich einfach durchzukämpfen“, sagte Wood, die Darstellerin in der beliebten US-Fernsehserie „Westworld“ ist. „Ich merkte, dass sich die Crew sehr unwohl fühlte und niemand wusste, was er tun sollte.“

Sie sei „unter Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen zu einem kommerziellen Sexualakt gezwungen“ worden, sagte sie in der Dokumentation. „Ich wurde quasi vor der Kamera vergewaltigt.“ Dem Dokumentarfilm zufolge setzte Manson – der mit echtem Namen Brian Warner heißt – Wood später unter Druck, Journalisten zu sagen, dass es während der Dreharbeiten zu dem Video keinen echten Sex gegeben habe.
Manson dementiert die Behauptungen
Mansons Anwalt Howard King wies die Behauptung in einer Erklärung gegenüber AFP zurück. „Von allen falschen Behauptungen, die Evan Rachel Wood über Brian Warner aufgestellt hat, ist ihre phantasievolle Nacherzählung über die Entstehung des Musikvideos ‚Heart-Shaped Glasses‘ vor 15 Jahren die dreisteste und am leichtesten zu widerlegen, da es mehrere Zeugen gab“, schrieb er.
Woods Mutter berichtete, dass sie von einem Mitglied des Filmteams erfuhr, dass Manson Wood Absinth „und was auch immer“ gegeben hatte. Ihre Tochter war demnach nicht in der Lage, zuzustimmen, als er vom Drehbuch abwich.

King erklärte hingegen, Wood sei während des dreitägigen Drehs „voll bei Sinnen“ gewesen und „stark in die wochenlange Planung der Vorproduktion und die tagelange Nachbearbeitung des endgültigen Schnitts eingebunden“ worden. „Die simulierte Sexszene wurde mehrere Stunden lang gedreht, mit mehreren Einstellungen aus verschiedenen Winkeln und mehreren langen Pausen zwischen den Kameraeinstellungen.“ Sein Mandant „hatte am Set keinen Sex mit Evan, und sie weiß, dass das die Wahrheit ist“.

Manson wurde bereits von mehreren Frauen des sexuellen Missbrauchs beschuldigt, darunter auch der „Game of Thrones“-Darstellerin Esme Bianco. Wood warf ihm im Februar „grauenhaften“ Missbrauch vor.
Die Polizei von Los Angeles hatte vergangenes Jahr bestätigt, dass sie Anschuldigungen wegen häuslicher Gewalt gegen den Sänger untersuchte. Manson hatte sich nach Bekanntwerden der Vorwürfe von seiner Plattenfirma Loma Vista Recordings und seiner Agentur CAA getrennt. Er nimmt aber weiterhin Musik auf und wirkte vergangenes Jahr auf Kanye Wests Album „Donda“ mit.
Die HBO-Dokumentation „Phoenix Rising“ schildert die Bemühungen von Wood und anderen mutmaßlichen Opfern sexueller Übergriffe, die Verjährungsfrist für Sexualverbrechen zu verlängern, um Frauen mehr Zeit zu geben, nach einem Missbrauch Gerechtigkeit zu suchen.

Evan Rachel Wood: Marilyn Manson soll sie beim Videodreh vergewaltigt haben,"Evan Rachel Wood wirft ihrem Ex-Freund Marilyn Manson vor, sie während des Drehs eines Musikvideos vergewaltigt zu haben.
In einer Doku erhebt Evan Rachel Wood neue Vorwürfe gegen Marilyn Manson. Sie soll von ihrem Ex vor laufender Kamera vergewaltigt worden sein.
Vor fast genau einem Jahr hat sich Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (34) mit schweren Missbrauchsvorwürfen gegen Ex-Freund Marilyn Manson (53) an die Öffentlichkeit gewandt. Mehrere Frauen meldeten sich daraufhin mit ähnlichen Anschuldigungen zu Wort. Eine neue Doku namens ""Phoenix Rising"", die beim renommierten Sundance Filmfestival Premiere feierte, lieferte nun weitere Details über Woods angeblich gewaltsame Beziehung zu dem Schockrocker. Das berichtet unter anderem die Musik-Branchenseite ""Rolling Stone"".
Demnach sei sie im Jahr 2007 während des Drehs des Musikvideos zum Song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"" vor laufender Kamera vergewaltigt worden. In einer ""simulierten Sexszene"" sei Manson ""wirklich in mich eingedrungen"", erinnert sich Wood an das traumatische Erlebnis zurück. ""Ich habe dem nie zugestimmt"", so der ""Westworld""-Star weiter. Kurz zuvor war die Beziehung der beiden öffentlich geworden. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war sie 18 Jahre alt, er 38.
Evan Rachel Wood wurde mit Alkohol gefügig gemacht
In ""Phoenix Rising"" erzählt sie: ""Ich wurde unter falschen Angaben zu einem kommerziellen Sexakt gezwungen. Damals wurde die erste Straftat gegen mich verübt – ich wurde wortwörtlich vor der Kamera vergewaltigt."" Ferner gibt Wood laut des Berichts in der Doku an, dass ihr während ihrer Zeit am Set Absinth verabreicht worden sei, eine Spirituose mit hohem Alkoholanteil. Sie sei in dieser Zeit ""kaum bei Bewusstsein"" gewesen, heißt es weiter. Die gesamte Filmcrew habe sich ""unwohl gefühlt und niemand wusste, was zu tun ist.""
Außerdem sei sie von Brian Warner, wie der Musiker mit bürgerlichem Namen heißt, daraufhin unter Druck gesetzt worden, ihre Beziehung gegenüber Journalisten als ""romantisch"" zu bezeichnen. Die Realität sah ihr zufolge anders aus: ""Das Video war erst der Anfang der Gewalt, die im Laufe der Beziehung immer weiter eskalieren sollte."" Bis 2010 waren die beiden dennoch zusammen – weil ihr ""eine Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und sie zu Gehorsam manipuliert wurde.""
Seit die ersten Vorwürfe vor gut einem Jahr laut geworden waren, wies Marilyn Manson sie kategorisch von sich. Seiner Aussage nach seien die ""intimen Beziehungen stets einvernehmlich gewesen.""",2022-01-25T07:28:00Z,https://www.stern.de,STERN.de

《西部世界》女星指控Marilyn Manson 19歲拍MV時遭「邪神」強姦,"現年34歲的《西部世界》（Westworld）美國女星兼歌手Evan Rachel Wood，曾在去年2月表示，多年來曾遭前男友美國歌手「邪神」Marilyn Manson「恐怖地」虐待她。她近日在紀錄片《Phoenix Rising》，詳細講述如何被Marilyn Manson性侵的經過，指出她在2007年拍攝《Heart-Shaped Glasses》MV時，Marilyn Manson「基本上在鏡頭前強姦了她」。
《愛不回家》在2003年上映，是Evan Rachel Wood的成名作，她憑這部作品獲提名角逐金球獎最佳戲劇類電影女主角。（《愛不回家》劇照）
Evan Rachel Wood在即將在HBO上架的全新紀錄片《Phoenix Rising – Part I: Don't Fall》中透露，在拍攝《Heart-Shaped Glasses》MV時，與她的想法完全不同：「我們要拍攝的事情是沒有跟我商量過。我們曾經討論過一個模擬的性愛場景，但當真正拍攝時，他開始真正的插入。」
Evan Rachel Wood拍攝《愛不回家》時大約16歲。（《愛不回家》劇照）
Evan Rachel Wood還在該紀錄片表示，她在《Heart-Shaped Glasses》MV的拍攝現場「感到不安」，而且「沒有人照顧」。她說：「拍攝這MV是一次非常痛苦的經歷，我不知道如何為自己辯護，也不知道如何拒絕，因為我從小被教導不要頂嘴，只需要堅持到底。」
紀錄片《Phoenix Rising》由Amy Berg負責監製，詳細講述Evan Rachel Wood如何被Marilyn Manson性侵的經過。
可是最終因為感到噁心，她不得不把這件事說出來：「我好像做了一些可恥的事，我可以說當時的工作人員都感到不自在，沒有人知道應該怎麼做。因為虛假的藉口，我被強迫從事商業性行為。那是他對我的第一次犯罪行為，我基本上在鏡頭前遭到強姦。」

至於當初的《Heart-Shaped Glasses》MV拍攝概念，Evan Rachel Wood表示：「（他們）告訴我會度過了一段美好又浪漫的時光，但這些都不是事實。然而當時我害怕做任何會讓Brian Warner（Marilyn Manson原名）不高興的事。」而Evan Rachel Wood還在紀錄片提到，Marilyn Manson是納粹的粉絲，其中包括取笑她的猶太血統，而Marilyn Manson房間寫有「殺死所有猶太人」的字句。

目前Marilyn Manson沒有任何回應，但根據紀錄片《Phoenix Rising》的說法，Marilyn Manson的法律團隊不評論這指控。其實在去年傳出Marilyn Manson性侵或虐待多名女性後，Marilyn Manson的律師曾發表一份聲明，當時內容聲稱「Brian Warner強烈否認任何性侵或虐待任何人的指控。」",2022-01-25T06:15:04Z,https://www.hk01.com,香港01

Dans cette production, qui montre la lutte visant à augmenter le délai de prescription en cas de crimes sexuels pour permettre aux victimes d'obtenir justice, l'actrice revient sur le tournage en 2007 du clip de ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"", un des tubes de Marilyn Manson, alors son compagnon.
""Nous avions parlé d'une scène de sexe simulé. Mais quand les caméras tournaient, il a commencé à me pénétrer réellement"", dit la jeune femme. ""Je n'avais jamais donné mon accord pour ça"", insiste-t-elle.
Actrice depuis l'enfance, elle explique qu'elle ""n'avait pas su dire non"" car elle avait ""été conditionnée et formée à ne jamais répondre, à aller au bout coûte que coûte"".

Durant l'agression, ""je peux dire que l'équipe était très embarrassée et que personne ne savait quoi faire"", ajoute l'actrice.
D'après le documentaire, Marilyn Manson a ensuite fait pression sur la jeune femme pour qu'elle assure aux journalistes qu'il n'y avait pas eu de scène de sexe réel durant le tournage.
Plusieurs accusatrices
L'avocat du chanteur, Howard King, a démenti ces accusations.

""La scène de sexe simulée a demandé plusieurs heures de tournage avec de multiples prises sous différents angles, et plusieurs longues pauses entre chaque installation de caméras"", affirme l'avocat.
""Brian n'a pas eu de relation sexuelle avec Evan sur ce plateau, et elle sait que c'est la vérité"", poursuit Howard King.
Plusieurs femmes, comme l'actrice Esmé Bianco (""Game of Thrones""), ont accusé Marilyn Manson de viols et d'autres agressions, ce qu'il nie.
La police de Los Angeles a confirmé l'an dernier avoir ouvert une enquête sur des accusations de violences dans le cadre du couple contre le chanteur, portant sur des faits commis entre 2009 et 2011.
Aujourd'hui âgé de 53 ans, Marilyn Manson s'est créé un personnage public à l'image inquiétante, d'inspiration gothique, maquillé, portant deux lentilles différentes, avec cheveux de jais.

Evan Rachel Wood Accuses Marilyn Manson of On-Camera Rape,"ERW Photo: Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic
In part one of Phoenix Rising, HBO’s upcoming two-part documentary about Marilyn Manson accuser and activist Evan Rachel Wood, which premiered at the virtual 2022 Sundance Film Festival January 23, Wood claims that Manson, whose legal name is Brian Hugh Warner, “essentially raped” her on-camera without her consent. The alleged incident took place on the set of Manson’s 2007 music video for “Heart-Shaped Glasses,” when Wood was 19. Manson denied the allegations to E! News via his lawyer, who said in a statement that Manson “did not have sex with Evan on that set.”
The video features Wood wearing Lolita sunglasses and having sex with Manson. “We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that,” Wood recalls in the documentary. “I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me. It was a really traumatizing experience, filming the video. I didn’t know how to advocate for myself or know how to say no because I had been conditioned and trained to never talk back, to just soldier through. I felt disgusting and like I had done something shameful, and I could tell that the crew was very uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do.”
Wood’s mother recounts how the day after the shoot, her ex-husband heard from a crew member that on set, Wood “was out of it, that he [Manson] was giving her absinthe and whatever else,” and he was allegedly making her do things that weren’t in the script to which “she cannot consent.” Wood puts it in no uncertain terms: “I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses. That’s when the first crime was committed against me, and I was essentially raped on-camera.” Manson’s lawyer stated that Wood was “fully coherent” during the shoot and “heavily involved” in pre-production, planning, and editing for the video. He described Wood’s claims as an “imaginative retelling” that could be disproved by multiple witnesses.
In the documentary, Wood also recounts how Manson used fear to keep her silent about the incident, saying, “Brian was really clear about how I should discuss the video with the press, how I was supposed to tell people that we had this great romantic time, and none of that was the truth. But I was scared to do anything that would upset Brian in any way.” She calls this incident “just the beginning of the violence that would escalate over the course of the relationship.” Directed by Amy Berg, Phoenix Rising follows Evan Rachel Wood “as she takes her experience as a survivor of domestic violence to pursue justice, heal generational wounds, and reclaim her story.” The documentary comes in the wake of her alleged abusive ex, Marilyn Manson, facing multiple sexual-assault lawsuits featuring testimony of Wood and others. Phoenix Rising will air on HBO in March.

"Actriţa americană Evan Rachel Wood îl acuză de viol pe Marilyn Manson, într-un documentar","Actriţa americană Evan Rachel Wood îl acuză de viol pe Marilyn Manson, într-un documentar
Actriţa americană Evan Rachel Wood l-a acuzat pe cântăreţul Marilyn Manson că a violat-o profitând de filmările la unul dintre videoclipurile sale, transmite News.ro.
Evan Rachel Wood, cunoscută pentru rolurile din serialul „Westworld” sau din filmul „Thirteen”, a făcut acuzaţiile în documentarul HBO „Phoenix Rising”, prezentat la Festivalul de Film de la Sundance. În această producţie, care arată lupta pentru creşterea termenului de prescriere în cazul infracţiunilor criminale pentru a permite victimelor să obţină dreptate, actriţa a revenit la filmările din 2007 ale videoclipului de la „Heart-Shaped Glasses”, una dintre melodiile lui Marilyn Manson, pe atunci partenerul ei.
„Am vorbit de o scenă de sex simulat. Dar când camerele s-au întors, el a început să mă penetreze cu adevărat”, a spus femeia. „Nu am fost de acord cu asta”, a insistat ea. Actriţă din copilărie, ea a explicat că „nu a ştiut să spună nu” căci a fost „învăţată să nu răspundă niciodată”.
Evan Rachel Wood a început o relaţie cu Marilyn Manson – pe numele adevărat Brian Warner – în 2006, la vârsta de 18 ani. Cântăreţul avea atunci 37 de ani.
„Am fost obligată la un act sexual comercial sub un pretext fals (…). Am fost violată în faţa unei camere de filmat”, a mărturisit ea. În timpul agresiunii, „pot să spun că echipa era foarte jenată şi că nimeni nu ştia ce să facă”, a adăugat actriţa. Conform documentarului, Marilyn Manson a făcut apoi presiuni ca tânăra să-i asigure pe jurnalişti că nu a existat o scenă de sex real în timpul filmării.
Avocatul cântăreţului, Howard King, a dezminţit aceste acuzaţii. „Dintre toate afirmaţiile false ale lui Evan Rachel Wood despre Brian Warner, povestirea videoclipului muzical Heart-Shaped Glasses, filmat acum 15 ani, este cea mai nesăbuită şi uşor de infirmat, deoarece existau mulţi martori”, a scris el într-un comunicat pentru AFP.
„Scena de sex simulat a cerut mai multe ore de filmare cu multe cadre din diferite unghiuri şi multe pauze lungi între fiecare instalare de cameră”, a afirmat avocatul. „Brian nu a avut o relaţie sexuală cu Evan pe acel platou, şi ea ştie că este adevărul”, a continuat Howard King.
Mai multe femei, precum actriţa Esmé Bianco („Game of Thrones”), l-au acuzat pe Marilyn Manson de violuri şi alte agresiuni, ceea ce el neagă. Poliţia din Los Angeles a confirmat anul trecut că a deschis o anchetă cu privire la acuzaţii de violenţe contra cântăreţului pentru fapte comise între 2009 şi 2011.
În prezent, în vârstă de 53 de ani, Marilyn Manson şi-a creat un personaj public cu imagine tulburătoare, de inspiraţie gotică, machiat, purtând lentile diferite, cu păr negru. Numele său este inspirat de cel al actriţei Marilyn Monroe şi de al lui Charles Manson, cel care i-a provocat moartea actriţei Sharon Tate. Casa lui de discuri Loma Visa Recordings şi agenţia artistică CAA au rupt orice relaţie cu cântăreţul ca urmare a acuzaţiilor care i-au fost aduse. El continuă totuşi să înregistreze melodii şi apare pe albumul „Donda” lansat anul trecut de Kanye West.

Actress Evan Rachel Wood says singer Marilyn Manson raped her during video shoot,"LOS ANGELES (AFP) - American actress Evan Rachel Wood has accused goth rocker Marilyn Manson of raping her on camera during the filming of a music video for his hit single Heart-Shaped Glasses (2007).
Wood, 34, made the allegations - which Manson denies - in Phoenix Rising, an HBO documentary premiering at the Sundance film festival on Sunday (Jan 23).
""We had discussed a simulated sex scene. But once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real,"" said Wood. ""I had never agreed to that.""
Former child actress Wood began dating Manson - whose real name is Brian Warner - in 2006 when she was 18 and he was 37.
Manson, now 53, said Heart-Shaped Glasses was inspired by seeing Wood wearing the glasses made famous on the movie poster for late director Stanley Kubrick's Lolita (1962).
""I didn't know how to advocate for myself or know how to say no, because I had been conditioned and trained to never talk back, to just soldier through,"" said Wood, star of TV series Westworld (2016 to present).
""I could tell that the crew was very uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do. I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretences... I was essentially raped on camera.""
According to the documentary, Manson later pressured Wood to tell journalists there had been no actual sex during the filming of the video.

'Phoenix Rising' Director on Evan Rachel Wood's Journey to Accuse Marilyn Manson,"Director Amy Berg told Insider the documentary wasn't originally about Wood's abusive experience with Manson.
""When we started talking about Wood's abuse it was impossible to not show him,"" she said.
Berg said part two of the documentary will focus on other women who accuse Manson of abuse.

Documentary filmmaker Amy Berg was producing movies about dogs for Netflix when Evan Rachel Wood tracked her down.
Berg, who had built a career making movies about sensitive topics like pedophilia in Hollywood (2014's ""An Open Secret""), commentary on the US justice system (2019's ""The Case Against Adnan Syed""), and rape within the Catholic Church (2006's ""Deliver Us from Evil,"" for which she received an Oscar nomination), had turned to executive producing the series ""Dogs,"" which celebrates the bond people have with their four-legged friends.
But when Wood set out to change the statute of limitations for victims of domestic abuse in California through the Phoenix Act — which extended the period of time in which a domestic violence case can be filed in the state from 1-3 years to 3-5 — the actress reached out to Berg to film her journey. The director knew she had to step back into darker territory.
""I love making films and this was an important story, I needed to tell it,"" Berg told Insider over a Zoom chat on Monday.
Berg began to film Wood and something happened, the ""Westworld"" star didn't just start talking about being a victim of sexual abuse, but began saying who her abuser was: Brian Warner, better known to the world as Marilyn Manson. (Manson has denied Wood's claim of abuse.)
Berg's two-part documentary ""Phoenix Rising,"" which had a special work-in-progress screening of part one at the Sundance Film Festival on Sunday (the entire doc airs on HBO in March), looks not just at Wood's quest to get the Phoenix Act passed but delves into her disturbing relationship with the rocker.
Berg says the end result is ""bigger than what we thought we were doing initially.""
Evan Rachel Wood is the subject of the documentary, ""Phoenix Rising."" Sundance Film Festival
Wood accuses Manson of abuse in the documentary, including him 'essentially raping her' on a music video set
Marilyn Manson began dating Wood in 2007 at the zenith of his popularity as a rocker whose shocking songs and exploits built him a legion of fans. Wood, who was 19 years his junior, was a rising star in Hollywood who gained notice in Hollywood for being a teen not scared of taking on challenging material catered for mature audiences.
Wood says in part one of ""Phoenix Rising,"" seen by Insider, that it wasn't a sexual attraction to Manson that drew her in at first, but a feeling that was ""very alluring and you want more.""
After Manson got divorced from his then-wife Dita Von Teese in 2007, he and Wood made their relationship public in the same year (they were briefly engaged before their relationship ended in 2010).
As the documentary chronicles, Manson's treatment of Wood turned disturbing, and Berg felt the only way to explain how Wood got to the point of lobbying for the Phoenix Act was to show where she'd been.
""I didn't set out to make a film about Brian Warner,"" Berg said. ""But when we started talking about Wood's abuse it was impossible to not show him; how he's acted and how he's been supported by his team for decades. I think it's important to see that's not acceptable behavior.""
In the documentary, Wood claims that Manson ""essentially raped her"" when they filmed the music video for his 2007 song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)."" Wood said in the documentary she and Manson ""had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real.""
Manson's attorney, Howard King, said in a statement to Insider, ""Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.""
The doc also features Wood showing a photo of an ""M"" scar that she says is on her body, near her pelvic area, that Manson gave her.
Berg said going down these dark episodes of Wood's past took a toll on her and her crew.
""Because it wasn't the film we set out to make, it adds quite a lot of work for the production team,"" Berg said, praising her crew who pulled hours of disturbing footage of Manson's antics over the years.
""You start having nightmares,"" Berg said of working on a project like this, ""it's intense.""
But what's even scarier, Berg learned, is that Wood isn't the only one to accuse Manson of abuse.

Part 2 of the documentary will focus on other Manson sexual abuse accusers
As Berg filmed Wood after her successful lobbying in California, the next bombshell dropped. The actress publically named Manson as her abuser in February, stating that she was ""brainwashed and manipulated into submission.""
""There was always a discussion of when, not if,"" Berg said about what led to Wood going public while they were filming. ""It was a matter of timing and it felt right at that moment.""
Berg said the attention drawn to Wood led to the filmmaker and her team hearing from other women who said they had suffered abuse at Manson's hands.
""We met a number of survivors and there was just an echo of voices that were saying the same thing as Wood was,"" Berg said.
That is the focus of part two of ""Phoenix Rising,"" Berg told Insider. It's not just Wood coming to terms with the abuse she went through but other women speaking out for the first time about what they went through when encountering the rock star.

Berg said that they are still filming some key footage and are close to locking picture on part two, but there have been roadblocks along the way that she never expected. One is getting the rights to use some songs that are on the same label Manson is with.
""All I can tell you is there were some songs that we wanted to license for the film that we were not given access to,"" Berg said. ""His label was protecting him. It was really upsetting. I was surprised.""
Insider has reached out to Loma Vista Recordings and Interscope, Manson's previous record labels, for comment.
Despite the adversity, Berg has been impressed by how Wood has taken it all in her stride and hopes for the day when this is all behind her.
""I think she wants the freedom to be away from this story,"" Berg said of Wood. ""What I've seen is she's doing this for the overall good: the other survivors, for justice. That's why she's doing this. Once you start to speak you have to give the access because we wanted to really get to know Evan, and that's what you'll find in the second half of the movie.""
And Berg admits she'll be happy when she can step away from this story as well. She said she's ready to go back to her Netflix series on dogs. Or maybe something even more exotic.
""I need to do something a little lighter,"" Berg said of whatever her next movie is. ""Like go making something in Bali.""",2022-01-25T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Marilyn Manson: Evan Rachel Wood beschuldigt Sänger der Vergewaltigung,"Mehrere Frauen werfen dem US-Rocker Marilyn Manson sexuelle Übergriffe vor. Ex-Freundin Evan Rachel Wood sagt nun, der Sänger habe sie während eines Videodrehs vergewaltigt. Mansons Anwalt weist das zurück.

Die US-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood hat den Rock-Sänger Marilyn Manson der Vergewaltigung bei einem Musikvideo-Dreh beschuldigt. Wood erhob die Vorwürfe in einer Dokumentation, die am Sonntag auf dem Sundance Film Festival in den USA Premiere hatte. Demnach sei eine „simulierte Sexszene“ für das Video zur 2007 erschienenen Hitsingle „Heart-Shaped Glasses“ abgesprochen gewesen. „Aber sobald die Kameras liefen, fing er an, mich wirklich zu penetrieren“, sagte Wood.
„Ich hatte dem nie zugestimmt“, betonte sie. Wood war 2006 mit Manson zusammengekommen. Sie war damals 18 und er 37 Jahre alt. Manson sagte, er sei zu „Heart-Shaped Glasses“ inspiriert worden, als er Wood mit der Brille sah, die auf dem berühmten Filmplakat von Stanley Kubricks „Lolita“ abgebildet war.
„Ich wusste nicht, wie ich für mich selbst eintreten oder nein sagen sollte, weil ich darauf konditioniert und trainiert worden war, nie zu widersprechen und mich einfach durchzukämpfen“, sagte Wood, die Darstellerin in der beliebten US-Fernsehserie „Westworld“ ist. „Ich merkte, dass sich die Crew sehr unwohl fühlte und niemand wusste, was er tun sollte.“

Sie sei „unter Vorspiegelung falscher Tatsachen zu einem kommerziellen Sexualakt gezwungen“ worden, sagte sie in der Dokumentation. „Ich wurde quasi vor der Kamera vergewaltigt.“ Dem Dokumentarfilm zufolge setzte Manson – der mit echtem Namen Brian Warner heißt – Wood später unter Druck, Journalisten zu sagen, dass es während der Dreharbeiten zu dem Video keinen echten Sex gegeben habe.
Manson dementiert die Behauptungen
Mansons Anwalt Howard King wies die Behauptung in einer Erklärung gegenüber AFP zurück. „Von allen falschen Behauptungen, die Evan Rachel Wood über Brian Warner aufgestellt hat, ist ihre phantasievolle Nacherzählung über die Entstehung des Musikvideos ‚Heart-Shaped Glasses‘ vor 15 Jahren die dreisteste und am leichtesten zu widerlegen, da es mehrere Zeugen gab“, schrieb er.
Woods Mutter berichtete, dass sie von einem Mitglied des Filmteams erfuhr, dass Manson Wood Absinth „und was auch immer“ gegeben hatte. Ihre Tochter war demnach nicht in der Lage, zuzustimmen, als er vom Drehbuch abwich.

King erklärte hingegen, Wood sei während des dreitägigen Drehs „voll bei Sinnen“ gewesen und „stark in die wochenlange Planung der Vorproduktion und die tagelange Nachbearbeitung des endgültigen Schnitts eingebunden“ worden. „Die simulierte Sexszene wurde mehrere Stunden lang gedreht, mit mehreren Einstellungen aus verschiedenen Winkeln und mehreren langen Pausen zwischen den Kameraeinstellungen.“ Sein Mandant „hatte am Set keinen Sex mit Evan, und sie weiß, dass das die Wahrheit ist“.

Manson wurde bereits von mehreren Frauen des sexuellen Missbrauchs beschuldigt, darunter auch der „Game of Thrones“-Darstellerin Esme Bianco. Wood warf ihm im Februar „grauenhaften“ Missbrauch vor.
Die Polizei von Los Angeles hatte vergangenes Jahr bestätigt, dass sie Anschuldigungen wegen häuslicher Gewalt gegen den Sänger untersuchte. Manson hatte sich nach Bekanntwerden der Vorwürfe von seiner Plattenfirma Loma Vista Recordings und seiner Agentur CAA getrennt. Er nimmt aber weiterhin Musik auf und wirkte vergangenes Jahr auf Kanye Wests Album „Donda“ mit.
Die HBO-Dokumentation „Phoenix Rising“ schildert die Bemühungen von Wood und anderen mutmaßlichen Opfern sexueller Übergriffe, die Verjährungsfrist für Sexualverbrechen zu verlängern, um Frauen mehr Zeit zu geben, nach einem Missbrauch Gerechtigkeit zu suchen. Das Sundance-Filmfestival, das dieses Jahr wegen der Corona-Pandemie erneut online stattfindet, läuft noch bis zum 30. Januar.",2022-01-25T04:45:34Z,https://www.welt.de,WELT

In un doc presentato al Sundance Evan Rachel Wood racconta lo stupro subito da Marilyn Manson,"LOS ANGELES - Il Sundance Film Festival fa emergere i dettagli dell'accusa di stupro rivolta dall'attrice statunitense Evan Rachel Wood al cantante Marilyn Manson, suo ex compagno. La violenza sarebbe avvenuta durante le riprese di uno videoclip della rockstar, come raccontato dalla Wood, nota per i suoi ruoli nella serie Westworld e nel film Thirteen, nel corso del documentario della HBO Phoenix Rising, presentato appunto al Sundance. In questa produzione, che mostra la battaglia per aumentare la prescrizione dei crimini sessuali per permettere alle vittime di ottenere giustizia, la donna risale alle riprese del 2007 del video di Heart-Shaped Glasses, uno dei successi di Marilyn Manson, allora suo compagno. Evan Rachel Wood aveva iniziato a frequentare Manson - il cui vero nome è Brian Warner - nel 2006, all'età di 18 anni; mentre il cantante all'epoca aveva 37 anni.
""Avevamo parlato di fare una scena di sesso simulata. Ma quando le telecamere stavano girando, ha iniziato a farlo per davvero - ha sostenuto Evan Rachel Wood - non avevo mai acconsentito a questo"". ""Sono stata costretta a un atto sessuale commerciale con l'inganno - ha proseguito - sono stata violentata davanti a una telecamera"". E durante l'episodio, ha raccontato ancora, ""posso dire che la troupe era molto imbarazzata e nessuno sapeva cosa fare"". Secondo il documentario, Marilyn Manson avrebbe poi fatto pressione sulla giovane donna per assicurare ai giornalisti che non c'era stata una vera scena di sesso durante le riprese.
L'avvocato del cantante, Howard King, ha negato le accuse. ""Di tutte le false affermazioni di Evan Rachel Wood su Brian Warner, il suo fantasioso racconto delle riprese del video Heart-Shaped Glasses di 15 anni fa è il più spudorato e il più facile da confutare, dato che c'erano numerosi testimoni"", ha affermato in una dichiarazione.",2022-01-25T04:22:00Z,https://www.repubblica.it,la Repubblica
L'actrice Evan Rachel Wood accuse Marilyn Manson de viol,"Le créateur Thierry Mugler est décédé dimanche à 73 ans de ""mort naturelle"", a annoncé son attaché de presse à l'AFP. Ayant régné sur la mode des années 1980, il continuait de ravir des stars internationales avec ses tenues spectaculaires aux silhouettes marquées.
""Nous avons l'immense tristesse de vous faire part du décès de Monsieur Manfred Thierry Mugler survenu dimanche 23 janvier 2022"", est-il également écrit dans un communiqué publié sur le compte Facebook officiel du créateur français. ""Que son âme repose en paix.""
Selon son attaché de presse Jean-Baptiste Rougeot, la mort du grand couturier, qui se faisait désormais appeler Manfred Thierry Mugler, est survenue de façon inattendue dimanche après-midi. Il avait encore des projets et devait annoncer de nouvelles collaborations en début de semaine, a-t-il indiqué.
Les premiers hommages sont arrivés dans la nuit des Etats-Unis. ""Vous avez changé notre perception de la beauté. (...) Votre héritage est quelque chose que je porte avec moi dans tout ce que je fais"", a écrit sur Instagram le directeur artistique de Mugler, l'Américain Casey Cadwallader.
La chanteuse Diana Ross a partagé sur Twitter une photo avec le créateur français lors d'un de ses défilés à Paris en 1990, avec ces mots: ""Vous allez me manquer, Thierry Mugler, c'était un moment merveilleux dans nos vies"".
""Repose en paix, Thierry Mugler"", a écrit la chanteuse Beyonce sur son site, sur une photo en noir et blanc d'un Thierry Mugler souriant.
Metteur en scène dans l'âme
Né à Strasbourg en décembre 1948, Thierry Mugler était arrivé à Paris à 20 ans puis avait crée sa propre griffe ""Café de Paris"" en 1973, avant un an plus tard de fonder la société ""Thierry Mugler"". Ses silhouettes structurées et sophistiquées s'étaient rapidement imposées. La ""femme Mugler"", aux épaule accentuées, décolletés plongeants et tailles corsetées, a fait le tour du monde, de Jerry Hall à Kim Kardashian.
Metteur en scène dans l'âme, il avait marqué les esprits en devenant pionnier, dès les années 1970, des défilés à grand spectacle. Il s'était plus tard lancé dans la création de parfums. Son premier modèle féminin ""Angel"", lancé en 1992, a connu un très grand succès, jusqu'à disputer la première place des ventes au mythique N°5 de Chanel.
Ses collections mode avait aussi marqué le monde politique, comme lorsque en 1985, le ministre français de la Culture Jack Lang fut sifflé à l'Assemblée nationale à cause de son costume col Mao signé Mugler, porté sans cravate.
""Se détacher de la haute couture""
Thierry Mugler s'était retiré de la mode en 2002. Mais les icônes de la pop culture d'aujourd'hui comme Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Cardi B ou Kim Kardashian arborent encore ses tenues d'archives pour les grandes occasions.
Ainsi, en septembre 2021, pour l'inauguration de l'exposition ""Thierry Mugler, Couturissime"" au Musée des arts décoratifs à Paris, la rappeuse américaine Cardi B avait posé à ses côtés vêtue d'une spectaculaire robe à paillettes rouge, surmonté de plumes.
""Mugler voulait se détacher de la haute couture qui correspondait à une élite, et montrer que les jeunes pouvaient aussi porter de la haute couture et que cela pouvait être autre chose qu'une robe pour aller à une soirée chic"", avait à l'époque déclaré à l'AFP Thierry-Maxime Loriot, commissaire de l'exposition, produite à l'origine par le Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal.
Parmi les dernières photos sur son compte Facebook, on pouvait voir Kim Kardashian, en tenue et chapeau de cow-bow métallisés, conçue pour elle pour Halloween par le créateur.
""Mugler Follies""
En 2013 et 2014, le couturier avait voulu ""bousculer"" l'art de la revue en lançant les ""Mugler Follies"" dans un théâtre parisien, transformé en cabaret.
Danseuses singulières de la filiforme au modèle Botero, ventriloques, cantatrice, chanteuse de fado, acrobates, numéros de force inédits: cela faisait ""longtemps"" qu'il voulait monter une revue, ""un art libre, de joie de vivre et d'échange, sans message, où tout est possible"", avait-il à l'époque confié à l'AFP. ""La mode ne me manque pas vraiment"", expliquait-il alors.
""Je fais beaucoup plus maintenant: de l'architecture, du design, monter une revue, mettre en scène... Quand j'étais couturier, c'était une mise en scène journalière proposée à des clientes. Maintenant, c'est une narration, une histoire, des shows, des films...""

Marilyn Manson nega ter estuprado Evan Rachel Wood em videoclipe,"O advogado de Marilyn Manson respondeu às alegações de Evan Rachel Wood de que a atriz foi estuprada diante das câmeras pelo cantor durante a gravação de um videoclipe em 2007. Em um comunicado enviado à imprensa, ele ainda acusou Wood de inventar ""uma mentira descarada e fácil de refutar"".
Desde fevereiro de 2021, Evan acusa publicamente Mason, seu ex-namorado, de abuso sexual. A revelação de que o artista teria a estuprado em frente às câmeras — no clipe de ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"" (2007) — foi divulgada no documentário ""Phoenix Rising"" (2022).
Segundo a atriz de ""Westworld"", na época das gravações, ela e Mason discutiram uma cena de sexo simulada para o videoclipe. No entanto, assim que as câmeras começaram a rodar, Wood afirma que o ex a penetrou de verdade. ""Eu nunca concordei com isso! Era um caos completo e eu não me sentia segura, ninguém estava cuidando de mim. Eu me sentia nojenta"", disse.
Howard King, advogado de Marilyn Manson, negou as alegações de Evan em uma declaração enviada à People. Ele afirmar que o cantor ""não fez sexo com Evan no set"" e que ""ela sabe que isso é verdade"". Confira o comunicado na íntegra abaixo:
""De todas as falsas alegações que Evan Rachel Wood fez sobre Brian Warner [verdadeiro nome de Marilyn Mason], sua releitura imaginativa da produção do videoclipe de 'Heart-Shaped Glasses', há 15 anos, é a mais descarada e fácil de refutar, porque havia várias testemunhas. Evan não estava apenas engajada durante os três dias de filmagem, mas também fortemente envolvida em semanas de planejamento de pré-produção e dias de edição de pós-produção do corte final. A cena de sexo simulada levou várias horas para ser filmada com várias tomadas, usando ângulos diferentes e várias pausas longas entre as configurações da câmera"".",2022-01-25T03:00:00Z,https://www.uol.com.br,UOL

Mais quand les caméras tournaient, il a commencé à me pénétrer réellement», dit la jeune femme. «Je n’avais jamais donné mon accord pour ça», insiste-t-elle. Actrice depuis l’enfance, elle explique qu’elle «n’avait pas su dire non» car elle avait «été conditionnée et formée à ne jamais répondre, à aller au bout coûte que coûte».
«Violée devant une caméra»
Evan Rachel Wood avait commencé à fréquenter Marilyn Manson – de son vrai nom Brian Warner – en 2006, à l’âge de 18 ans. Le chanteur en avait à l’époque 37. «J’ai été contrainte à un acte sexuel commercial sous un prétexte (…) J’ai été violée devant une caméra», témoigne-t-elle. Durant l’agression, «je peux dire que l’équipe était très embarrassée et que personne ne savait quoi faire», ajoute l’actrice.
D’après le documentaire, Marilyn Manson a ensuite fait pression sur la jeune femme pour qu’elle assure aux journalistes qu’il n’y avait pas eu de scène de sexe réel durant le tournage.
L’avocat du chanteur, Howard King, a démenti ces accusations. «De toutes les fausses affirmations d’Evan Rachel Wood sur Brian Warner, sa relecture fantaisiste du tournage du clip de +Heart-Shaped Glasses+ il y a 15 ans est la plus éhontée et la plus facile à réfuter, car il y avait de nombreux témoins», écrit-il dans un communiqué à l’AFP.
«La scène de sexe simulée a demandé plusieurs heures de tournage avec de multiples prises sous différents angles, et plusieurs longues pauses entre chaque installation de caméras», affirme l’avocat. «Brian n’a pas eu de relation sexuelle avec Evan sur ce plateau, et elle sait que c’est la vérité», poursuit Howard King.
D’autres femmes l’accusent
Plusieurs femmes, comme l’actrice Esmé Bianco («Game of Thrones»), ont accusé Marilyn Manson de viols et d’autres agressions, ce qu’il nie. La police de Los Angeles a confirmé l’an dernier avoir ouvert une enquête sur des accusations de violences dans le cadre du couple contre le chanteur, portant sur des faits commis entre 2009 et 2011.
Aujourd’hui âgé de 53 ans, Marilyn Manson s’est créé un personnage public à l’image inquiétante, d’inspiration gothique, maquillé, portant deux lentilles différentes, avec cheveux de jais. Son nom même est inspiré de l’actrice Marilyn Monroe et du gourou sanguinaire Charles Manson, qui provoqua le meurtre de l’actrice Sharon Tate.
Sa maison de disques Loma Vista Recordings et son agence artistique CAA ont toutes deux rompu leurs relations avec le chanteur à la suite des accusations portées contre lui. Il continue toutefois à enregistrer des titres et figure notamment sur l’album «Donda» sorti l’an dernier par Kanye West.

"Marilyn Manson Denies He ""Essentially Raped” Evan Rachel Wood on Set","Watch : Evan Rachel Wood Accuses Ex Marilyn Manson of Abuse
Content warning: This story discusses sexual assault and rape.
Nearly a year after accusing ex Marilyn Manson of abuse, Evan Rachel Wood has alleged that he ""essentially raped"" her while they filmed a music video together in 2007.
In the two-part documentary Phoenix Rising, the first of which premiered on Jan. 23 at the Sundance Film Festival, Wood shared her alleged experience on the set of ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"" when she was 19 years old and he was about 38.
According to People, the Thirteen actress said she was ""coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses."" In Phoenix Rising, she alleged, ""That's when the first crime was committed against me. I was essentially raped on-camera.""
Manson, now 53, denied her accusations in a statement from his lawyer to E! News on Jan. 24. He said the rocker (real name Brian Warner) ""did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.""",2022-01-25T00:41:31Z,https://www.eonline.com,E! NEWS
Actress Evan Rachel Wood accuses Marilyn Manson of ‘essentially raping’ her on music video set,"Evan Rachel Wood has accused Marilyn Manson of “essentially [raping her] on-camera” during the filming of his 2007 video for Heart-Shaped Glasses.
The Golden Globe-nominated actress details her relationship with Manson, real name Brian Warner, in new documentary Phoenix Rising, which premiered on Sunday at Sundance Film Festival.
Wood has accused Manson of abusing her “for years” after she became involved with him when she was 18 and he was 38, between 2006 to 2011.
In the music video for Heart-Shaped Glasses, from Manson’s sixth studio album Eat Me, Drink Me, the rock musician dressed Wood in sunglasses similar to those seen on the poster of 1962 film Lolita, about a man who becomes sexually obsessed with an underage girl.
The video shows Manson appearing to have sex with Wood while the couple are drenched in fake blood.
“It’s nothing like I thought it was going to be,” Wood says in the documentary.
“We’re doing things that were not what was pitched to me. We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that... It was complete chaos.”
“I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me. It was a really traumatising experience filming the video. I felt disgusting and that I had done something shameful, and I could tell that the crew was uncomfortable, and nobody knew what to do.”
Wood says in the documentary that she was “coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretences”.
“That’s when the first crime was committed against me,” she says. “I was essentially raped on-camera.”
Wood has alluded to being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor in interviews over the years, but did not publicly accuse Manson by name until February last year.
“The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, known to the world as Marilyn Manson,” she wrote in a post to Instagram.
“He started grooming me as a teenager and horrifically abused me for years.”
The same day that Wood shared her allegations, four other women accused Manson of abuse, and sexual and physical violence. He has now been accused of abuse by more than 12 women, including Game of Thrones actor Esme Bianco.
Manson has denied all of the abuse, calling them “horrible distortions of reality”.
In a 2009 interview with Spin, conducted shortly after his breakup with Wood, Manson claimed that he called Wood 158 times while self-mutilating and then blamed her for it.",2022-01-25T00:00:00Z,https://www.independent.ie,Independent.ie
Evan Rachel Wood accuses Marilyn Manson of rape on set,"US actress Evan Rachel Wood has accused goth rocker Marilyn Manson of raping her on camera during the filming of a music video for his 2007 single Heart-Shaped Glasses.
Wood made the allegation - which Manson denies - in Phoenix Rising, a new HBO documentary premiering at the Sundance film festival on Sunday.
Former child actress Wood began dating Manson - whose real name is Brian Warner - in 2006 when she was 18 and he was 37.

Manson said Heart-Shaped Glasses was inspired by seeing Wood wearing the glasses made famous on the movie poster for Stanley Kubrick's Lolita.
""I didn't know how to advocate for myself or know how to say no, because I had been conditioned and trained to never talk back, to just soldier through,"" said Wood, star of TV series Westworld.
""I could tell that the crew was very uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do.
""I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretences... I was essentially raped on camera.""
According to the documentary, Manson later pressured Wood to tell journalists there had been no actual sex during the filming of the video.
Marilyn Manson - real name Brian Warner - has denied Evan Rachel Wood's allegation
Wood's mother recounts hearing through a crew member that Manson was giving Wood absinthe ""and whatever else,"" and that she was unable to consent.
Manson's lawyer Howard King denied the allegation in a statement to AFP, saying that there were ""multiple witnesses"".
King said Wood was ""fully coherent"" during the three-day shoot and ""heavily involved in weeks of pre-production planning and days of post-production editing of the final cut.""
""The simulated sex scene took several hours to shoot with multiple takes using different angles and several long breaks in between camera setups.
""Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth.""
Manson has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault, including Game of Thrones actress Esme Bianco.
Los Angeles police last year confirmed they were investigating domestic violence allegations against the singer.
Manson, who has long cultivated a controversial image with his ghostly make-up and stage name evoking serial killer Charles Manson, has parted ways with his record label Loma Vista Recordings and Hollywood agency CAA since the allegations became public.
But he continues to record music, appearing on Kanye West's album Donda last year.
Phoenix Rising documents efforts by Wood and others to extend the statute of limitations for sex crimes, allowing women more time to seek justice following abuse.
The Sundance film festival - taking place online again this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic - runs until 30 January.

"'Marilyn Manson me estuprou diante das câmeras', diz Evan Rachel Wood","Evan Rachel Wood acusou Marilyn Manson de estuprá-la diante de câmeras no estúdio de filmagens do clipe Heart-Shaped Glasses, em 2007. A nova declaração aparece no documentário Phoenix Rising, que aborda a vida e a carreira da atriz e modelo.
""Tínhamos discutido uma cena de sexo simulada, mas, assim que as câmeras começaram a rodar, ele começou a me penetrar de verdade. Eu nunca tinha concordado com isso"", recorda Evan no documentário, cuja primeira parte foi exibida no Festival de Sundance no domingo (23).
De acordo com The Guardian, Evan e Manson começaram a namorar em 2006, quando ela tinha 18 anos, e ele, 38. Os dois tiveram um namoro ioiô por quatro anos. A gravação do clipe aconteceu em 2007. Na época, sites americanos levantaram o debate se o cantor estaria apenas encenando ou realmente fazendo sexo com a modelo.
""Sou uma atriz profissional. Tenho feito isso toda a minha vida. Nunca estive em um set tão pouco profissional. Era um caos completo, e eu não me sentia segura. Ninguém estava cuidando de mim. Foi uma experiência realmente traumatizante filmar o vídeo"", prossegue Evan do documentário da diretora Amy Berg, com estreia prevista na HBO para o segundo semestre.
""Não sabia como me defender ou dizer não porque eu tinha sido condicionada e treinada para nunca responder --para simplesmente seguir em frente. Eu me senti nojenta como se tivesse feito algo vergonhoso, e percebi que a equipe estava muito desconfortável e ninguém sabia o que fazer. Fui coagida a um ato sexual comercial sob falsos pretextos. Foi quando o primeiro crime foi cometido contra mim, e eu fui essencialmente estuprada diante das câmeras. ""
Escândalo estourou no ano passado
Em 2010, Manson pediu a mão dela em casamento durante um show em Paris. No mesmo ano, o relacionamento terminou. Em fevereiro de 2021, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood fez as primeiras acusações de abuso e violência doméstica contra o ex-noivo.
""O nome do meu abusador é Brian Warner, também conhecido mundialmente como Marilyn Manson. Ele começou a me assediar quando eu ainda era uma adolescente e abusou terrivelmente de mim por anos"", escreveu a atriz em seu perfil no Instagram à época.
""Passei por uma lavagem cerebral, fui manipulada para ser submissa. Estou cansada de viver com medo de retaliação, difamação ou chantagem. Estou aqui para expor esse homem perigoso e avisar a todas as indústrias que o apoiam, antes que ele destrua mais vidas. Estou ao lado das muitas vítimas que não vão mais ficar em silêncio"", completou.
Uma das primeiras manifestações da atriz foi em 2016 em uma entrevista à revista Rolling Stone e uma carta aberta publicada em seu perfil no Twitter. À época, contudo, ela revelou as situações de abuso, mas sem citar o nome de Manson.
Evan Rachel Wood está entre várias mulheres, incluindo a atriz de Game of Thrones Esmé Bianco, que acusa Manson de agressão sexual, abuso psicológico, violência ou intimidação. Segundo The Guardian, Manson negou as acusações feitas contra ele, chamando-as de ""horríveis distorções da realidade"". Ele disse que seus ""relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram inteiramente consensuais"".",2022-01-24T23:19:00Z,https://noticiasdatv.uol.com.br,Notícias da TV

Evan Rachel Wood accuses Marilyn Manson of raping her during filming of music video,"Evan Rachel Wood has accused former partner Marilyn Manson of forcing her to have sex while filming one of his music videos.
In February 2021, nearly 15 years after meeting him at a party in Los Angeles when she was 18 and he was 37, Emmy-nominated Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood publicly accused her former fiance Brian Warner – otherwise known as the controversial goth rocker Marilyn Manson – as her abuser for the first time.
But as the now-34-year-old Wood claims in Phoenix Rising, a feature documentary whose first half premiered Sunday night at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, the signs had been apparent for years – and in at least one instance, viewed by nearly 30 million fans on YouTube.
In the film, set to air in its entirety on HBO in March, Wood recalls her appearance in his 2007 music video for Heart-Shaped Glasses, which shows the couple having sex, or so it appears.
“We had discussed a simulated sex scene,” Wood said. “But once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that … It was complete chaos and I did not feel safe – no one was looking after me … I felt disgusting and like I had done something shameful, and I could tell that the crew was very uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do.
“I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretences. That’s when the first crime was committed against me – and I was essentially raped on camera,” she alleged.
A lawyer for Marilyn Manson has said the musician “denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone”.

Phoenix Rising, directed by the Oscar and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Berg, additionally documents Wood’s activism in creating the 2019 Phoenix Act, a bill that extended the statute of limitations for domestic violence from three years to five in California.
It also discusses Wood’s childhood, growing up in a North Carolina home where her parents often fought.
But the bulk of the first part of the documentary dives into dark details of the relationship between Wood and Manson.
“This isn’t about revenge or, like, he’s a monster and he needs to be punished and destroyed,” she said. “He’s already destroyed.”
In the film, Wood further explains how Manson allegedly forced her to lie to the press about the Heart-Shaped Glasses filming experience (“For me, that was one of the most romantic moments of my entire life,” she told GQ at the time).
She also touches on other disturbing allegations.
For instance, during their relationship – which she said ended in 2011 – she alleges Manson berated her for being Jewish. He allegedly painted watercolours showing Nazi themes, such as figures resembling Adolf Hitler, and got a chest tattoo with a shape resembles a swastika.
“At one point, over the side of the bed where I slept, he wrote ‘Kill all the Jews’ on our bedroom wall,” she alleges in the documentary.
They first met when Manson approached Wood at a Chateau Marmont party, with the singer telling her he was a fan of her performance in the 2003 film Thirteen.
At that time as a teenager, Wood describes in the documentary how she felt insecure, had “no core identity,” was a closeted bisexual and felt lost. Wood had a boyfriend at the time; Manson was married to the burlesque performer Dita Von Teese.
Manson was married to Dita Von Teese when he first approached Wood.
Wood saw Manson as an artist who seemed to take interest in her opinions on music and film.
“That definitely boosted my ego and confidence,” she said.
But she said a sexual encounter allegedly begun by Manson when Wood was 18 and he was still married changed things.
“This guy can have whoever he wants and he’s chosen you,” she said of how she felt in the moment. “You’re special now. And if I said no, then I was really scared we weren’t going to be friends anymore, so I let things go farther than I wish I had.”
Before long, Wood alleged it led to “love bombing,” a dating trend defined as communicating an overabundance of affection and attention as a form of emotional manipulation.
“Scarification and branding was part of it,” said Wood. “He carved an E [into his skin] and I carved an M … as a way to show ownership and loyalty. And I carved it right next to my vagina to show him that I belonged to him.”
A representative for Wood did not return a message from The Post seeking additional comment on this documentary. Manson’s lawyer, Howard King, also didn’t return a request seeking comment in advance of the screening.
However, a previous statement from “his counsel” is included at the end of the film, saying, “Mr Warner vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone. These lurid claims against my client have three things in common – they are all false, alleged to have taken place more than a decade ago and part of a co-ordinated attack by former partners and associates of Mr Warner who have weaponised the otherwise mundane details of his personal life and their consensual relationships into fabricated horror stories.”

Wood’s 2021 announcement naming Manson, posted on her Instagram and shared in a statement with Vanity Fair, came as a bombshell.
Manson, who has since been accused of abuse by some 15 other women, including Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco, is now being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department, though no charges have been filed.
In the documentary, Wood said: “I don’t know who Brian Warner is honestly. I think Brian Warner died a long time ago. I think he has a lot of different personalities, specifically Marilyn and Manson. Two very different people. Brian doesn’t really show up.”

Evan Rachel Wood claims Marilyn Manson 'essentially raped' her during music video shoot,"Follow us on Image Source : IG/EVAN RACHEL WOOD, MARILYN MANSON Evan Rachel Wood claims Marilyn Manson 'essentially raped' her during music video shoot
American actor and musician Evan Rachel Wood has accused Marilyn Manson of raping her on the set of the music video for his 2007 single 'Heart-Shaped Glasses'. According to Fox News, the claim was made in a new documentary titled 'Phoenix Rising' that focuses on her life and career. It premiered during the 2022 Sundance Film Festival. In it, the 34-year-old alleged that during a previously discussed ""simulated sex scene,"" the rocker ""started penetrating me for real,"" once the cameras were rolling. ""I had never agreed to that,"" said Wood.
As per the star, she was fed absinthe on the set of the video where she played a Lolita-styled character. Wood also said she was barely conscious to object to the 53-year-old's alleged actions. ""[I had] never been on a set that unprofessional in my life up until this day. It was complete chaos and I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me,"" said Wood. Wood said she didn't know how to advocate for herself or say no ""because I had been conditioned and trained to never talk back, to just soldier through."" She claimed the crew ""was very uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do.""
Wood said the alleged incident made her feel ""disgusted and like I had done something shameful."" ""I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses. That's when the first crime was committed against me and I was essentially raped on camera,"" she said.
According to the outlet, Wood said her ex-fiance gave her ""really clear"" instructions on how she was supposed to describe the video to journalists. But Manson teased the press with the notion that there was truth to the music video's ""realism.""
""I was supposed to tell people we had this great, romantic time and none of that was the truth. But I was scared to do anything that would upset Brian in any way. The video was just the beginning of the violence that would keep escalating over the course of the relationship,"" said Wood.
Wood and Manson's relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19. They were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up. In 2021, Wood publicly accused Manson of abuse, alleging she was ""manipulated into submission"" during their relationship. She previously spoke out about being abused in a relationship but didn't name the person until she detailed the allegations on Instagram.
""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,"" Wood said. ""I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives,"" the post shared.
She concluded, ""I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent."" Wood is among several women, including 'Game of Thrones' actor Esme Bianco, who has accused Manson of sexual and physical violence involving torture. Manson has denied Wood's allegations as ""horrible distortions of reality."" He responded to Wood's allegations with his own Instagram post the same day as hers.
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how -- and why -- others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth,"" his post said. As per Fox News, Manson's label, Loma Vista Recordings, said in a statement that after the ""disturbing allegations,"" it will ""cease to further promote his current album"" and has ""also decided not to work with Marilyn Manson on any future projects.""

"""Doveva essere una scena di sesso simulato"", ma non lo fu","LOS ANGELES - «Eravamo d'accordo che doveva essere una scena di sesso simulato, ma quando abbiamo cominciato a girare lui è entrato davvero dentro di me»: l'attrice di ""Westworld"" Evan Rachel Wood torna ad accusare di stupro Marilyn Manson in un nuovo documentario, ""Phoenix Rising"", presentato al Sundance e in onda in marzo su Hbo.
Sarebbe successo sul set del video destinato ad accompagnare il singolo del 2007 ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)"". Manson l'aveva fatta bere (sul set c'è una bottiglia di assenzio) e l'allora giovanissima Rachel ha ammesso che non aveva più veramente il controllo di se stessa per obiettare alle azioni del musicista. «Non ero mai stata in una situazione così poco professionale fino a quel giorno. C'era il caos totale, non mi sentivo sicura. Ma non sapevo come dire di no, perché ero stata condizionata a non replicare mai, a stringere i denti e andare avanti». L'attrice ha aggiunto che la troupe era imbarazzata: «Nessuno sapeva cosa fare».
Quell'incidente - ha detto nel documentario - l'ha fatta sentire disgustata di se stessa, come se fosse stata lei a fare qualcosa di vergognoso. «Il video - ha aggiunto - segnò l'inizio della violenza di cui poi ci fu una escalation nel corso della nostra relazione».
La Wood aveva rivelato un anno fa che il controverso cantante di ""Antichrist Superstar"" era il partner a cui aveva fatto riferimento quando nel corso degli anni si era dichiarata vittima di violenze domestiche. L'attrice e Manson (vero nome Brian Warner) hanno avuto una relazione diventata pubblica nel 2007 quando lei aveva 19 anni e lui, 38enne, stava divorziando dall'attrice burlesque Dita von Teese. I due avevano annunciato il matrimonio nel 2010 per separarsi di lì a poco.
In uno show di solidarietà con la Wood almeno altre quattro donne avevano poi postato le loro esperienze raccontando di aver subito da Manson atti di violenza anche sessuale, abusi psicologici e altre forme di coercizione. Nel 2019 Rachel aveva sponsorizzato una legge dello stato di California, il Phoenix Act, che proroga i termini della prescrizione per i reati di violenza domestica e che ha dato il titolo al nuovo documentario firmato dalla regista Amy Berg candidata agli Oscar per ""Deliver Us from Evil"" sulla pedofilia nel clero cattolico.
Quanto a Manson, è stato scaricato dall'etichetta discografica Loma Vista e deve rispondere in tribunale ad almeno quattro azioni legali e a un'inchiesta di violenza domestica dopo che lo scorso novembre la polizia di Los Angeles gli ha fatto irruzione in casa.",2022-01-24T17:00:00Z,https://www.tio.ch,20 minuti Ticino
Evan Rachel Wood acusa Marilyn Manson de a ter violado durante gravação de videoclip,"Estas novas revelações surgem no âmbito da estreia de ""Phoenix Rising"", documentário sobre a vida e carreira de Evan Rachel Wood no festival Sundance 2022, escreve o jornal britânico The Guardian. Esta é mais recente de um rol de acusações feitas ao cantor de 53 anos de violência sexual e abuso.
O episódio em questão terá ocorrido durante a gravação de ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)"", single de Marilyn Manson — nome artístico de Brian Warner — lançado em 2007.
O ato em questão era suposto ser uma cena de sexo simulado — algo que tinha sido previamente acordado entre os dois —, mas Manson terá ido mais longe. ""Ele começou a penetrar-me a sério"", quando as câmaras começaram a gravar, revela Wood. ""Eu nunca tinha concordado em fazer aquilo"", garante.
“Eu fui coagida a uma cena de sexo comercial sob falso pretexto. Esse foi o primeiro crime contra mim e eu fui, essencialmente, violada em vídeo"", afirma no documentário.
A atriz adianta que lhe terá sido dado absinto antes da cena e que, como resultado, estava num estado de consciência incapaz de resistir aos avanços de Manson. ""Nunca na minha vida estive num set tão pouco profissional como esse. Foi um completo caos e não me senti segura. Ninguém cuidou de mim"", revela. Wood tinha, à época, 19 anos.
O episódio não só fê-la sentir ""nojenta e como se tivesse feito algo vergonhoso"", como a atriz sublinha que, na altura, não sabia como defender-se ou dizer não porque ""tinha sido condicionada e treinada para nunca responder, apenas para lidar"".
Além da cena em si, Manson ter-lhe-á dado instruções de como falar sobre o videoclip aos jornalistas, sendo suposto que dissesse que ambos tiveram um momento ""ótimo e romântico"". ""Mas eu estava assustada de fazer algo que irritasse o Brian de qualquer forma. O vídeo foi apenas o início da violência que veio a aumentar ao longo da relação"", garante.
Esta é mais recente revelação da atriz. Em 2018, Evan Rachel Wood tinha referido que foi violada, durante as audiências que decorreram no Congresso dos Estados Unidos da América (EUA), sem, no entanto, revelar a identidade do agressor. No entanto, em janeiro de 2021 anunciou publicamente que se tratava de Manson numa publicação no Instagram: “Brian Warner, também conhecido pelo mundo como Marilyn Manson”.
A atriz revelou que Manson a “manipulou psicologicamente” ainda antes de fazer 20 anos, acrescentando que foi alvo de “abusos horríveis durante anos”. Wood contou que o músico a começou “a aliciar” quando era ainda adolescente e “abusou horrivelmente” dela “durante anos”. “Estou cansada de viver com medo de represálias, de calúnias e de chantagem”, escreveu Evan Rachel Wood.
A relação entre ambos foi tornada pública em 2007, quando Manson tinha 38 anos e Wood 19, e acabou em 2010, já com o noivado anunciado.
Em 2018, a procuradoria do condado de Los Angeles ponderou uma acusação formal a Manson por crimes de agressão e violência sexual, alegadamente cometidos em 2011, mas concluiu não haver elementos de prova suficientes para avançar. A alegada vítima foi então identificada apenas como uma relação do artista.
Depois das revelações de Wood, mais mulheres vieram a público para acusar Manson de abusos sexuais, manipulação, assédio sexual, maus-tratos e ameaças. Algumas das mulheres que dizem que foram violadas pelo artista revelaram que eram antigas 'groupies', e retrataram uma personagem sedutora, manipuladora, que as amarrava, ameaçava e obrigava ao consumo de drogas.
A estas acusações, Manson reagiu com uma publicação no Instagram. “Obviamente, a minha arte e a minha vida têm sido ímanes para a controvérsia, mas estas alegações recentes sobre mim são distorções horríveis da realidade”, escreveu.
O cantor garante que os seus “relacionamentos íntimos foram sempre inteiramente consensuais com parceiros com pensamento semelhante”, e que “outros estão agora a escolher deturpar o passado”.
Marilyn Manson, artista rock, ficou conhecido pela criação de uma personagem de inspiração gótica e o seu nome é uma junção do nome próprio da icónica atriz norte-americana Marilyn Monroe com o apelido do homicida Charles Manson, responsável pela morte da atriz Sharon Tate.
Em 2009, em entrevista à revista Spin, Manson disse que tinha “todos os dias a fantasia de pulverizar” o crânio da ex-noiva “com um martelo”.
O cantor norte-americano já atuou várias vezes em Portugal, a última das quais em junho de 2018, no Campo Pequeno, em Lisboa, onde apresentou ao vivo o décimo disco, “Heaven Upside Down”.
Brian Warner estreou-se em disco em 1994, com “Portrait of an American Family”, ao qual se seguiu “Antichrist Superstar”, álbum que vendeu milhões de cópias.",2022-01-24T16:39:24Z,https://24.sapo.pt,SAPO 24

Evan Rachel Wood: Von Marilyn Manson während Dreh vergewaltigt?,"In einer Doku erhebt Evan Rachel Wood neue Vorwürfe gegen Marilyn Manson. Wurde sie von ihrem Ex vor laufender Kamera vergewaltigt?
Vor fast genau einem Jahr hat sich Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (34) mit schweren Missbrauchsvorwürfen gegen Ex-Freund Marilyn Manson (53) an die Öffentlichkeit gewandt. Mehrere weitere Frauen meldeten sich daraufhin mit ähnlichen Anschuldigungen ebenfalls zu Wort. Eine neue Doku namens ""Phoenix Rising"", die beim renommierten Sundance Filmfestival Premiere feierte, lieferte nun weitere Details über Woods angeblich gewaltsame Beziehung zu dem Schockrocker. Das berichtet unter anderem die Musik-Branchenseite ""Rolling Stone"".
Demnach sei sie im Jahr 2007 während des Drehs des Musikvideos zum Song ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"" vor laufender Kamera vergewaltigt worden. In einer ""simulierten Sexszene"" sei Manson ""wirklich in mich eingedrungen"", erinnert sich Wood an das traumatische Erlebnis zurück. ""Ich habe dem nie zugestimmt"", so der ""Westworld""-Star weiter. Kurz zuvor war die Beziehung der beiden öffentlich geworden. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt war sie 18 Jahre alt, er 38.
Mit Alkohol gefügig gemacht
In ""Phoenix Rising"" erzählt sie: ""Ich wurde unter falschen Angaben zu einem kommerziellen Sexakt gezwungen. Damals wurde die erste Straftat gegen mich verübt - ich wurde wortwörtlich vor der Kamera vergewaltigt."" Ferner gibt Wood laut des Berichts in der Doku an, dass ihr während ihrer Zeit am Set Absinth verabreicht worden sei, eine Spirituose mit hohem Alkoholanteil. Sie sei in dieser Zeit ""kaum bei Bewusstsein"" gewesen, heißt es weiter. Die gesamte Filmcrew habe sich ""unwohl gefühlt und niemand wusste, was zu tun ist.""
Außerdem sei sie von Brian Warner, wie der Musiker mit bürgerlichem Namen heißt, daraufhin unter Druck gesetzt worden, ihre Beziehung gegenüber Journalisten als ""romantisch"" zu bezeichnen. Die Realität sah ihr zufolge anders aus: ""Das Video war erst der Anfang der Gewalt, die im Laufe der Beziehung immer weiter eskalieren sollte."" Bis 2010 waren die beiden dennoch zusammen - weil ihr ""eine Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und sie zu Gehorsam manipuliert wurde.""
Seit die ersten Vorwürfe vor gut einem Jahr laut geworden waren, wies Marilyn Manson sie kategorisch von sich. Seiner Aussage nach seien die ""intimen Beziehungen stets einvernehmlich gewesen.""",2022-01-24T15:51:00Z,https://www.stern.de,STERN.de
Marilyn Manson made me have sex on camera,"In February 2021, nearly 15 years after meeting him at a party in Los Angeles when she was 18 and he was 37, Emmy-nominated “Westworld” actress Evan Rachel Wood publicly accused her former fiancé Brian Warner — otherwise known as the controversial goth rocker Marilyn Manson — as her abuser for the first time.
But as the now 34-year-old Wood claims in “Phoenix Rising,” a feature documentary whose first half premiered Sunday night at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival, the signs had been apparent for years — and in at least one instance, viewed by nearly 30 million fans on YouTube.

In the film, set to air in its entirety on HBO in March, Wood recalls her appearance in his 2007 music video for “Heart-Shaped Glasses,” which shows the couple having sex, or so it appears. While the song plays over these specific clips in the video, the documentary airs the sound of Wood, then 19, shouting in distress.
“We had discussed a simulated sex scene,” Wood said. “But once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that … It was complete chaos and I did not feel safe — no one was looking after me … I felt disgusting and like I had done something shameful, and I could tell that the crew was very uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do. I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses. That’s when the first crime was committed against me — and I was essentially raped on camera.”
“Phoenix Rising,” directed by the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Berg, additionally documents Wood’s activism in creating the 2019 Phoenix Act, a bill that extended the statute of limitations for domestic violence from three years to five in California — as well as Wood growing up in a North Carolina home where her parents often fought. But the bulk of Sunday’s 77-minute Part One dives into other dark details of the relationship, and shows Wood, in 2020, moving closer to attaching the name of Manson, now 53, to them publicly.
“This isn’t about revenge or, like, he’s a monster and he needs to be punished and destroyed,” she said. “He’s already destroyed.”

Not only does Wood further explain how Manson allegedly forced her to lie to the press about the “Heart-Shaped Glasses” filming experience (“For me, that was one of the most romantic moments of my entire life,” she told GQ at the time), but she touches on other disturbing allegations. For instance, during their relationship — which she said she escaped in 2011 — Manson berated her for being Jewish. He painted watercolors showing Nazi themes, such as figures resembling Adolf Hitler, and he got a chest tattoo whose shape resembles a swastika.
“At one point, over the side of the bed where I slept, he wrote ‘kill all the Jews’ on our bedroom wall,” she alleges in the doc.
It all started by Manson approaching Wood at a Chateau Marmont party, with Manson telling Wood he was a fan of her performance in the 2003 film “Thirteen.” At that time as a teenager, Wood describes in the documentary how she felt insecure, had “no core identity,” was a closeted bisexual and felt lost. Wood had a boyfriend at the time; Manson was married to the burlesque performer Dita Von Teese. Wood saw Manson as an artist who seemed to take interest in her opinions on music and film “that definitely boosted my ego and confidence,” she said.
But a sexual encounter allegedly begun by Manson when Wood was 18 and he was still married led Wood into a manipulative trap.
Wood met Manson when she was 18 and he was 37, and “escaped” their nearly five-year-long relationship in 2011. “I don’t know what happened, but something really snapped and, from what I can tell, he really hates women,” Wood declares in her new documentary. WireImage
“This guy can have whoever he wants and he’s chosen you,” she said of how she felt in the moment. “You’re special now. And if I said no, then I was really scared we weren’t going to be friends anymore, so I let things go farther than I wish I had.”
Before long, it led to “love bombing,” a dating trend defined as communicating an overabundance of affection and attention as a form of emotional manipulation.
“Scarification and branding was part of it,” said Wood. “He carved an E [into his skin] and I carved an M … as a way to show ownership and loyalty. And I carved it right next to my vagina to show him that I belonged to him.”
A representative for Wood did not return a message from The Post seeking additional comment on this documentary. Manson’s attorney, Howard King, also didn’t return a request seeking comment in advance of the screening.
However, a previous statement from “his counsel” is included at the end of the film, saying “Mr. Warner vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone. These lurid claims against my client have three things in common — they are all false, alleged to have taken place more than a decade ago and part of a coordinated attack by former partners and associates of Mr. Warner who have weaponized the otherwise mundane details of his personal life and their consensual relationships into fabricated horror stories.”
Wood’s 2021 announcement naming Manson, posted on her Instagram and shared in a statement with Vanity Fair, came as a bombshell — and led to a swift downfall for Manson, who has since been accused of abuse by some 15 other women, including “Game of Thrones” actress Esmé Bianco, and is now being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department, though no charges have been filed.
Wood outed Manson as her alleged abuser in February 2021 — and multiple other women have since come forward with abuse allegations. E. Charbonneau
At the time, sources told The Post that Manson’s disturbing stage persona — which included slicing his chest open with a broken beer bottle while performing in 1995 — was just as troubling behind the scenes.
In Manson’s 1999 autobiography “The Long Hard Road Out of Hell,” which he co-wrote with Neil Strauss — and as mentioned in the documentary — he fesses up to throwing a bottle of perfume at his mother’s face, which permanently scarred her, when he suspected her of cheating on his father.
“In altercations that followed, I hit her, spit on her and tried to choke her,” he wrote. “She never retaliated. She just cried and I never felt sorry for her.”
Meanwhile, Wood has declared in her new doc: “I don’t know what happened, but something really snapped and, from what I can tell, he really hates women.” She later added, “I don’t know who Brian Warner is honestly. I think Brian Warner died a long time ago. I think he has a lot of different personalities, specifically Marilyn and Manson. Two very different people. Brian doesn’t really show up.”",2022-01-24T15:13:07Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post

Evan Rachel Wood: Ο Marilyn Manson με βίασε κατά τη διάρκεια γυρισμάτων βίντεο κλιπ του,"Η ηθοποιός Evan Rachel Wood κατηγορεί τον Μarylin Manson ότι τη βίασε στα γυρίσματα του μουσικού βίντεο για το single του από το 2007, «Heart-Shaped Glasses» (When the Heart Guides the Hand).
Στο Phoenix Rising, ένα νέο ντοκιμαντέρ για τη ζωή και την καριέρα της που έκανε πρεμιέρα στο φεστιβάλ Σάντανς 2022, η Wood είπε ότι κατά τη διάρκεια μιας «σκηνής προσομοίωσης σεξ» για την οποία είχαν συζητήσει προηγουμένως, ο Manson «άρχισε πραγματικά να διεισδύει» μόλις ξεκίνησαν να τραβάνε οι κάμερες.
«Δεν είχα συμφωνήσει ποτέ γι' αυτό», είπε.
Ισχυρίστηκε ότι στα γυρίσματα του βίντεο κλιπ, όπου υποδύεται μία λολίτα, της έδωσαν να πιει αψέντι και μετά βίας είχε τις αισθήσεις της για να αντισταθεί στις ενέργειες του Manson.
Η ηθοποιός πρόσθεσε ότι δεν είχε πάει ποτέ «σε ένα τόσο αντιεπαγγελματικό σετ στη ζωή μου μέχρι σήμερα. Ήταν το απόλυτο χάος και δεν ένιωθα ασφαλής. Κανείς δεν με πρόσεχε».
Είπε ότι δεν ήξερε πώς να υπερασπιστεί τον εαυτό της ή να πει όχι «επειδή είχα προετοιμαστεί και εκπαιδευτεί να μην αντιμιλάω ποτέ - απλώς να τελειώνω τη δουλειά μου σαν στρατιώτης» και ισχυρίστηκε ότι το συνεργείο αισθανόταν «πολύ άβολα και κανείς δεν ήξερε τι να κάνει».
Το περιστατικό που σύμφωνα με την ίδια συνέβη, την έκανε να νιώθει «αηδιαστική και σαν να είχα κάνει κάτι ντροπιαστικό. Με εξανάγκασαν σε μια εμπορική σεξουαλική πράξη με ψευδή προσχήματα. Τότε ήταν που διαπράχθηκε το πρώτο έγκλημα εναντίον μου και ουσιαστικά με βίασε μπροστά στην κάμερα».
Είπε ότι ο Manson της έδωσε «πραγματικά σαφείς» οδηγίες για το πώς θα έπρεπε να περιγράψει το βίντεο στους δημοσιογράφους. «Έπρεπε να πω ότι περάσαμε υπέροχα, ρομαντικά αλλά τίποτα από αυτά δεν ήταν η αλήθεια», λέει.
«Φοβόμουν όμως να κάνω οτιδήποτε θα αναστατώσει τον Brian (Marylin Manson) με οποιονδήποτε τρόπο. Το βίντεο ήταν μόνο η αρχή της βίας που θα συνέχιζε να κλιμακώνεται κατά τη διάρκεια της σχέσης».
Ο Manson, ωστόσο, έπαιξε με τα μέσα ενημέρωσης αφήνοντας υπονοούμενα ότι υπήρχε αλήθεια στον προφανή «ρεαλισμό» του βίντεο.
Η Wood έχει κατηγορήσει στο παρελθόν τον Manson, με τον οποίο είχε σχέση από το 2007 έως το 2010, ότι την παρενόχλησε όταν ήταν έφηβη, λέγοντας ότι «με κακοποιούσε φρικτά για χρόνια. Είχα υποστεί πλύση εγκεφάλου και χειραγωγήθηκα για να υποταχθώ».
Η Wood γνώρισε τον Manson το 2006. Εκείνη ήταν 18 και εκείνος 38 ετών.
Η ηθοποιός είναι ανάμεσα σε πολλές γυναίκες, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της ηθοποιού του Game of Thrones, Esmé Bianco, που έχουν κατηγορήσει τον Manson για σεξουαλική και σωματική βία που περιλαμβάνει βασανιστήρια.
Ο ίδιος έχει αρνηθεί τις κατηγορίες εναντίον του, κάνοντας λόγο για «φρικτές διαστρεβλώσεις της πραγματικότητας… οι στενές μου σχέσεις ήταν πάντα απολύτως συναινετικές».
Ωστόσο, είναι αντιμέτωπος με τουλάχιστον τέσσερις μηνύσεις, που τον κατηγορούν για σεξουαλική επίθεση, επίθεση και παρενόχληση, ενώ εκκρεμεί και έρευνα μετά από καταγγελίες για περιστατικά ενδοοικογενειακής βίας, στο τμήμα του σερίφη της κομητείας του Λος Άντζελες, που έκανε έφοδο στο σπίτι του τον Νοέμβριο του 2021.
Από τη στιγμή που το Vanity Fair δημοσίευσε ένα άρθρο που περιγράφει λεπτομερώς την πρώτη από αυτές τις καταγγελίες τον Φεβρουάριο του 2021, η δισκογραφική του εταιρεία, Loma Vista διέκοψε τη συνεργασία μαζί του.
Ο Manson έχει λάβει τη στήριξη του Kanye West, ο οποίος τον παρουσίασε σε εκδήλωση για το άλμπουμ του Donda, στο οποίο συμμετέχει ο μουσικός.
Ο Manson είναι μεταξύ των υποψηφίων για Grammy για τη συμμετοχή του αυτή στο «Donda». Το άλμπουμ είναι υποψήφιο για άλμπουμ της χρονιάς ενώ και το «Jail», το κομμάτι που συμμετέχει ο Manson είναι υποψήφιο για καλύτερο ραπ τραγούδι.
Μετά τη διαμάχη και τις κατηγορίες ο πρόεδρος και διευθύνων σύμβουλος της Ακαδημίας των Grammy, Harvey Mason Jr, είπε ότι δεν θα επηρεάσουν την επιλογή των καλλιτεχνών προσωπικά και νομικά ζητήματα.

Evan Rachel Wood,"Wood excoriates Warner directly here, recounting how physically, sexually and psychologically abusive he had been, cruelty which included drugging her and then raping her while they filmed the music video for his song “Heart-Shaped Glasses.” Only the first portion of this two-part HBO series was made available and shown via the Sundance Film Festival as this review went to press, but it’s pretty hard to see how Manson’s already shredded reputation will recover from it, no matter how much he denies, as reported here, that any of the allegations are true. Woods alludes to the fact that several other women, such as the actor Esme Bianco, have alleged that they suffered similar abuse from him and perhaps some of them will speak about it on camera in part two of Rising Phoenix.
Wood and Berg’s ultimate goal, however, seems to have less to do with exposing Warner for exposure’s sake than helping others recognize warning signs in their own troubled relationships — and influencing lawmakers. Berg has previous form here, having made scandal-exposing features such as An Open Secret, about the abuse of teens within the film industry, and Prophet’s Prey, which examined abuse within a fundamentalist sect of the Mormon church.
Wood, meanwhile, is seen here as an active and effective campaigner on behalf of the Phoenix Act (hence the film’s title), which extends the time domestic abuse survivors have to press charges against an abuser, a law that passed in the California state senate in 2020 after impassioned testimony from Wood and others.
Berg seamlessly weaves in footage of Wood speaking to the state senators and celebrating the passing of the legislation with fellow activists. These tearful, moving moments often involve artist Illma Gore, who is seen throughout the film helping Wood collate evidence of other survivors of Warner and supporting her as she looks back at her own diaries written when she first met Warner.
At least it’s a little reassuring to note that Wood has a support network of friends and family now. In fact, her mother Sara, father Ira and brother, also named Ira, are all interviewed here, even though she is not always flattering about her parents. Evan obliquely suggests that her parents’ own combative relationship when she was a child before they got divorced may have been related to the reasons why she fell into an abusive relationship years later. Elsewhere she mentions that she wasn’t happy with how her mother was managing the income Evan earned as a child actor. But that honesty about familial disharmony actually helps to make Evan a stronger witness for the prosecution here.
THE BOTTOM LINE: A survivor speaks eloquently.

Evan Rachel Wood Says Marilyn Manson Raped Her in Music Video,"Evan Rachel Wood says in the new documentary “Phoenix Rising” that she was “essentially raped on-camera” while filming the 2007 music video for Marilyn Manson’s “Heart-Shaped Glasses.” The video features Wood wearing “Lolita”-inspired heart-shaped glasses and having sex with Manson while flake blood rains down on them. Wood was 19 years old when she filmed the music video and alleges in the documentary that she was fed absinthe on set to the point that she was barely conscious to object when Manson had sex with her on camera.
“It’s nothing like I thought it was going to be,” Wood says in the documentary (via Rolling Stone). “We’re doing things that were not what was pitched to me. We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that…It was complete chaos. I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me.”
Wood continues, “It was a really traumatizing experience filming the video. I didn’t know how to advocate for myself or know how to say no because I had been conditioned and trained to never talk back — to just soldier through. I felt disgusting and that I had done something shameful, and I could tell that the crew was uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do.”
“I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses,” Wood adds. “That’s when the first crime was committed against me. I was essentially raped on-camera.”
Wood has spoken out several times in the past about how Manson “horrifically abused” her from 2006 to 2011. Regarding “Heart-Shaped Glasses,” Wood says in the documentary that Manson was “really clear” with her about how she should promote the music video in interviews.
“I was supposed to tell people we had this great, romantic time and none of that was the truth,” Wood says. “But I was scared to do anything that would upset [Manson] in any way. The video was just the beginning of the violence that would keep escalating over the course of the relationship.”

'Phoenix Rising': Evan Rachel Wood says Marilyn Manson experience 'not unique',"1/6

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 24 (UPI) -- Evan Rachel Wood said the documentary Phoenix Rising, which premiered virtually at the Sundance Film Festival Sunday, is bigger than her experiences with Brian Warner, aka Marilyn Manson. The documentary follows Wood coming forward with allegations of abuse by Warner, and her involvement in the Phoenix Act to change laws about domestic violence. ""Unfortunately, my story is not unique,"" Wood said at a virtual Q&A following the screening of Part 1 of Phoenix Rising. ""[The purpose is to] not just expose this person but to explain domestic violence and how it works."" Advertisement
Wood, 34, met Warner when she was 18 and they dated from 2006 to 2011. Wood testified before the California Senate on behalf of the Domestic Violence Bill of Rights in 2019, but did not name the abuser she described.
In an Instagram post Feb. 1, 2020, Wood said Warner abused her. Because the three year statute of limitations had passed, Wood and Ilma Gore formed the Phoenix Act to advocate for laws to extend the statute of limitations.

""I was not only pursuing my own kind of justice, but I was paired up with some of the most incredible people that I've ever met,"" Wood said. ""It ignited a desire and need in me to continue the conversation and do everything I could to raise awareness.""
One of the advocates with whom Wood works is Shay Franco-Clausen, who attended the screening and Q&A of Phoenix Rising. Franco-Clausen said Wood is raising the profile of domestic violence issues for women who are often overlooked.
""A lot of people don't look at DV or human trafficking when it comes to Black women,"" Franco-Clausen said. ""Inside jails, most women are survivors of domestic violence, which is a gateway from human trafficking or into human trafficking.""
Another advocate involved in the Phoenix Act is Ashley Walters, who also testified as a former employee of Warner's. Walters said she experienced a catharsis similar to Wood's simply by being able to name Warner.
""Nothing prepares you for what happens within when you actually say your abuser's name and tell the world what happened,"" Walters said.
Wood was friends with documentary filmmaker Amy Berg prior to Phoenix Rising. Wood asked Berg if she'd make a film about the Phoenix Act.

Phoenix Rising is a two part series that will air on HBO. Berg said Wood's tenacity in the face of the statute of limitations inspired her to make the series.
""When she was told that the statute of limitations had expired, that didn't stop her,"" Berg said. ""She went on to change the laws in California. As a storyteller, everything is there to tell a really important and interesting story.""
Berg said that the first part of Phoenix Rising is simply the backstory for the second half. Berg said the second part will also feature more stories from other survivors of domestic violence.
""I hope their stories will elevate courage in people who are living in domestic violence relationships in silence and looking for resources,"" Berg said. ""Overall, this was always about identifying patterns and trying to educate people.""
In the film, Wood describes techniques like grooming and love bombing, which are common among abusers, and Wood alleges Warner practiced them on her. Wood said the media also bears responsibility for shielding Warner for years.
""The way the press handled the story for many, many years is shameful,"" Wood said. ""It's time we finally tell the whole story and for the narrative to change and for the survivors to take back ownership of their stories.""

Berg said she still experienced industry figures protecting Warner. Phoenix Rising includes Manson's music and videos, particularly one for ""Heart-Shaped Glasses,"" which Wood alleges captured her sexual abuse on camera. Berg said the film faced resistance when clearing Manson songs.
""People are still protecting Brian Warner and they don't want to participate in anything that might upset him,"" Berg said. ""As an industry we need to take account at this point, not just for Brian Warner, for all the people who are being abusive towards women and men and children.""
HBO has not announced the premiere date for Phoenix Rising yet. As the first audience viewed Part 1, Wood reminded them that this is not a celebration of victory. It is a cry for more help and support for the Phoenix Act and other protections for survivors.
""It's not a ticker tape parade,"" Wood said. ""It's an SOS.""
Phoenix Rising filmmakers state at the end of Part 1 that they reached out to Warner and his legal representatives. They did not elect to comment on the specific allegations made against Warner in the film, but reissued a previous statement denying sexual assault or abuse.",2022-01-24T12:31:36Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
Evan Rachel Wood accuses Marilyn Manson of raping her on music video set,"The actor Evan Rachel Wood has accused the rock musician Marilyn Manson of raping her on the set of the music video for his 2007 single Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand).
In Phoenix Rising, a new documentary about her life and career which premiered at the 2022 Sundance film festival, Wood said that during a previously discussed “simulated sex scene”, Manson “started penetrating me for real” once the cameras were rolling.
“I had never agreed to that,” she said.
She said she was fed absinthe on the set of the video, in which she plays a character styled as Lolita, and was barely conscious to object to Manson’s alleged actions.
The Guardian has contacted representatives for Manson, born Brian Warner, for comment.
Wood said that she had “never been on a set that unprofessional in my life up until this day. It was complete chaos and I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me.”
She said she didn’t know how to advocate for herself or say no “because I had been conditioned and trained to never talk back – to just soldier through” and claimed that the crew “was very uncomfortable and nobody knew what to do”.
She said the alleged incident made her feel “disgusting and like I had done something shameful”.
“I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretences. That’s when the first crime was committed against me and I was essentially raped on camera.”
She said that Manson gave her “really clear” instructions on how she should describe the video to journalists. “I was supposed to tell people we had this great, romantic time and none of that was the truth,” she says.
“But I was scared to do anything that would upset Brian in any way. The video was just the beginning of the violence that would keep escalating over the course of the relationship.”
Manson, however, teased the media with the notion that there was truth to the video’s apparent “realism”.
Wood previously accused Manson, with whom she was in a relationship from 2007 to 2010, of grooming her when she was a teenager and said he “horrifically abused me for years.I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.”
Wood met Manson in 2006. She was 18, he was 38.
She is among a number of women, including Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco, who have accused Manson of sexual and physical violence involving torture.
Manson has denied the charges made against him, calling them “horrible distortions of reality … my intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual”.
He is facing up to four lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault, battery and harassment as well as an investigation into allegations of domestic violence incidents by the Los Angeles County sheriff’s department, which raided his home in November 2021.
After Vanity Fair published an article detailing the first of these allegations in February 2021, Manson was dropped by his record label, Loma Vista.
Manson has received support from the rapper Kanye West, who brought him out at a livestream event for his album Donda, on which Manson appears, and at one of his Sunday Service events.
Manson shares in the Grammy nominations for Donda, which is up for album of the year and best rap song for Jail, on which Manson appears. Following controversy over his recognition, Recording Academy president and CEO Harvey Mason Jr said that personal and legal matters would not affect artists’ eligibility.
Phoenix Rising, a film by Oscar-nominated director Amy Berg, will air on HBO in the US in March. It also follows the creation of the Phoenix Act, legislation led by Wood that extends the statute of limitations for survivors of domestic violence to pursue charges against their abusers, which was signed into law in October 2019.",2022-01-24T10:39:57Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
Everything Evan Rachel Wood Has Said About Marilyn Manson,"More than a decade has passed since actress Evan Rachel Wood and rock star Marilyn Manson ended their engagement in 2010.
Like many celebrity couples post-split, the pair vanished from the headlines to lead separate lives, with Rachel Wood marrying actor Jamie Bell and Manson—real name Brian Warner—tying the knot with photographer Lindsay Usich.
In 2021, the actress made allegations concerning abuse by Marilyn Manson, which have been discussed in the new movie Phoenix Rising, set to air in February on HBO.
The documentary, directed by Amy Berg, outlines the allegations Rachel Wood first made against Manson in 2021 and also includes shocking new claims, as transcribed by Pitchfork.
What Evan Rachel Wood Has Said About Marilyn Manson
In the film, Rachel Wood discussed the music video for Manson's 2007 single ""Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)"", starring the couple, where she alleged he ""essentially raped"" her on set.
Of the video accompanying the song reportedly inspired by Wood, she said of being on the video's set: ""It's nothing like I thought it was going to be. We're doing things that were not what was pitched to me.""
She added: ""We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real.
""I had never agreed to that. I'm a professional actress, I have been doing this my whole life, I'd never been on a set that unprofessional in my life up until this day.
""It was complete chaos, and I did not feel safe. No one was looking after me. It was a really traumatizing experience filming the video. I didn't know how to advocate for myself or know how to say no because I had been conditioned and trained to never talk back—to just soldier through.
""I felt disgusting and like I had done something shameful, and I could tell that the crew was very uncomfortable, and nobody knew what to do.
""I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses. That's when the first crime was committed against me and I was essentially raped on camera.""
In February 2021, Wood had alleged Manson was her abuser for the first time via a statement posted on her Instagram account.
""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.""
""I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""
In a mid-January 2022 Instagram post, Rachel Wood, wrote: ""Friendly reminder to the press. It [was] not only 'women' or 'former girlfriends' of Brian that have come forward.
""Multiple men and former employees have also come forward with stories of witnessing or experiencing their own abuse. Please don't [sic] edit them out of their own story.""
She added in a comment to the post: ""We are so used to these stories being centered around women and former partners, we sometimes only hear what we want. There is so much more out there a large majority of the press is already forgetting about.
""Some of this is intentional, as it's much easier to discredit a group of women because we are often scapegoated as 'crazy' or 'vengeful.'""
In October 2021, she posted: ""If you are outraged about the lack of movement from law enforcement, please call the District Attorney, the Attorney General LAPD, your local representatives and ask: 'What is being done about Brian Warner?'
""We need to keep the pressure on. We need your help.""
The U.S. actress revealed in a 2016 open letter on Twitter she had been raped twice.
She wrote: ""I don't believe we live in a time where people can stay silent any longer. I certainly can't. Not given the state our world is in with its blatant bigotry and sexism.
""It should be talked about because it's swept under the rug as nothing and I will not accept this as 'normal.'
It's a serious problem. I am still standing. I am alive. I am happy. I am strong. But I am still not ok.
""Yes, I have been raped. By a significant other while we were together. And on a separate occasion, by the owner of a bar.""
Manson has denied the allegations, saying they were ""horrible distortions of reality"" in February 2021, the most recent post to his Instagram page.
He wrote: ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how—and why—others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
In the wake of Wood's allegations, Loma Vista Recordings, which released Manson's most recent albums, announced the label would no longer be working with the artist and would cease promoting his latest album ""effective immediately.""

Evan Rachel Wood diz que Marilyn Manson a estuprou durante filmagens de videoclipe,"A atriz americana Evan Rachel Wood acusou o roqueiro gótico Marilyn Manson de estuprá-la diante das câmeras durante as filmagens do videoclipe de “Heart-Shaped Glasses”, seu hit de 2007.
Wood, estrela da série de televisão “Westworld”, fez as acusações no documentário “Phoenix Rising”, da HBO, que estreou no festival de cinema de Sundance.
“Discutimos uma cena de sexo simulada. Mas uma vez que as câmeras começaram a rodar, ele começou a realmente me penetrar”, disse ela. “Eu nunca concordei com isso”.
A ex-atriz mirim começou a namorar Manson, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Warner, em 2006, quando ela tinha 18 anos e ele, 37.
“Eu não sabia como me defender e não sabia como dizer não, porque fui condicionada e treinada para nunca responder, apenas para seguir em frente”, disse Wood. “Percebi que a equipe estava muito desconfortável e ninguém sabia o que fazer”.
“Fui forçada a participar de um ato sexual comercial sob falsos pretextos. Fui basicamente estuprada diante das câmeras”.
De acordo com o documentário, Manson mais tarde pressionou Wood a dizer aos repórteres que não houve sexo real durante a gravação do vídeo.
A mãe de Wood se lembra de ouvir de um membro da equipe que Manson estava dando a Wood licor de absinto “e qualquer outra coisa”, e que ela não estava em condições de consentir.
CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE
Representantes de Manson não responderam imediatamente ao pedido de comentário da AFP.
A polícia de Los Angeles confirmou no ano passado que estava investigando acusações de violência doméstica contra o cantor.
Manson, que cultiva uma imagem controversa e um nome artístico que lembra o serial killer Charles Manson, se separou de sua gravadora Loma Vista Recordings e da agência de Hollywood CAA desde que as alegações se tornaram públicas. Mas continua gravando música, e no ano passado participou do álbum “Donda”, de Kanye West.
O documentário “Phoenix Rising” mostra os esforços de Wood e outros sobreviventes de abuso sexual para estender o estatuto de limitações desses crimes e dar-lhes mais tempo para buscar justiça após o abuso.

Evan Rachel Wood acusó a Marilyn Manson de agredirla sexualmente en el rodaje de un videoclip,"(Foto: Getty Images)
A principios de 2021, Evan Rachel Wood acusó públicamente a Marilyn Manson de abusar de ella “horriblemente” cuando era una adolescente. Y ahora, la actriz estadounidense dio más detalles de su traumática experiencia y reveló que en 2007, el cantante la violó durante la grabación del videoclip “Heart-Shaped Glasses”, que ambos protagonizaron.
La intérprete realizó estas nuevas acusaciones en la primera parte del documental Phoenix Rising, que se estrenó en la noche del domingo 23 de enero en el Festival de Cine de Sundance.
En la pieza audiovisual, dirigida por Amy Berg, Wood cuenta lo duro que fue crecer como estrella infantil en medio del caos de Hollywood; pero además, narra cómo Marilyn Manson abusó de ella física y psicológicamente durante sus tres años de relación.
En una de las secuencias más desgarradoras del documental, la actriz de Westworld recordó cómo el músico la violó durante el videoclip “Heart-Shaped Glasses”, en el que ella era la actriz principal. Contó que al negociar el contrato le comentaron que había una escena de sexo simulada, y ella aceptó. Sin embargo, cuando inició el rodaje, la realidad fue distinta.
“No fue para nada como creía que iba a ser. Hicimos cosas que no eran lo que me habían propuesto. Habíamos hablado de una escena de sexo simulada, pero cuando las cámaras comenzaron a grabar empezó a penetrarme de verdad. Yo nunca habría accedido a eso. Soy una actriz profesional, he estado haciendo esto toda mi vida. Nunca había estado en un set tan poco profesional hasta ese día”, explicó la famosa en el documental, según recoge el diario Pitchfork.
Evan Rachel Wood comenzó en el cine en 1997, con solo nueve años. A esa edad, grabó la película Cavando hasta China, por la que fue nominada a los Globos de Oro. En 2003, con 15 años, recibió una segunda nominación por su papel en Thirteen. Y solo tres años después, en 2006, conoció a Marilyn Manson en una fiesta en Los Ángeles.

La pareja anunció su relación en 2007, año en que se grabó Heart-Shaped Glasses. Ella nunca accedió a filmar una escena de sexo real, pero cuando ocurrió la agresión, no supo cómo reaccionar ni cómo defenderse. Según cuenta en Phoenix Rising se sintió vulnerable, sola y desprotegida. Ella tenía 19 años y él 38.
“Era un caos total y no me sentía segura. Nadie se estaba preocupando por mí. No sabía cómo defenderme a mí misma o cómo decir que no, porque me habían condicionado y entrenado para nunca responder, solo seguir hacia adelante. Me sentí asquerosa, como si hubiera hecho algo vergonzoso y me di cuenta de que el equipo estaba muy incómodo y nadie sabía qué hacer. Me forzaron a realizar un acto sexual comercial bajo falsos pretextos. Fue entonces cuando se cometió el primer crimen conta mí y fui básicamente violada en cámara”, contó Wood.
La primera vez que Evan Rachel Wood se atrevió a denunciar públicamente al cantante de rock fue en 2021. Lo hizo a través de una publicación de Instagram en la que confesó que estaba cansada de vivir con miedo.
“El nombre de mi abusador es Brian Warner, también conocido en el mundo como Marilyn Manson. Me empezó a acosar cuando era adolescente y abusó de mí horriblemente por años”, escribió la actriz estadounidense de 34 años.
“Me lavaron el cerebro y me manipularon hasta la sumisión. Ya no voy a vivir más con miedo a las represalias, injurias o extorsiones. Estoy aquí para exponer a este hombre peligroso y a las muchas industrias que habilitaron su comportamiento antes de que arruine más vidas. Todo mi apoyo a las muchas víctimas que ya no guardarán silencio”, continuó.

Casi al mismo tiempo, otras cuatro mujeres publicaron declaraciones similares en Instagram. Se trata de Ashley Walters, Sarah McNeilly, Ashley Lindsay Morgan y una mujer que dio su nombre solo como Gabriella.
La actriz también compartió una captura de pantalla de un artículo de febrero de 2018 en el que la actriz de Dr. House, Charlyne Yi, acusó a Manson de acosar a varias mujeres mientras visitaba el set del drama de la cadena Fox.
En sus declaraciones, detallaron experiencias desgarradoras que, según afirman, incluyeron agresión sexual, abuso psicológico y/o diversas formas de coerción, violencia e intimidación.
Evan Rachel Wood y Marilyn Manson mantuvieron una relación de tres años, desde 2007 hasta 2010. Antes de separarse, estuvieron prometidos durante ocho meses. En los últimos años, la actriz luchó activamente por reformar la legislación de California para extender el plazo de prescripción de los delitos de violencia doméstica de tres a cinco años. El cambio fue confirmado en 2019 y se hizo efectivo en 2020.
En medio de ese proceso, en 2018, la famosa compartió su testimonio frente a un tribunal. Confirmó que fue víctima de violencia de género, pero no hizo público el nombre del agresor.
“(Los abusos) comenzaron poco a poco, pero se intensificaron con el tiempo, incluyendo amenazas contra mi vida y ataques psicológicos. El hombre que decía que me amaba me violó creyendo que estaba inconsciente. [...] [Mi abusador] Me ataba las manos y los pies para ser torturada mental y físicamente, hasta que sentía que había quedado probado mi amor por él... Mientras estaba atada y era golpeada me decía ‘podría matarte ahora mismo’. Sentí que mi cuerpo me abandonaba y tenía demasiado miedo de huir”, relató frente al tribunal.

Los representantes de Manson no han emitido ningún comunicado para responder a las nuevas acusaciones de Wood, pero en ocasiones anteriores han negado categóricamente acusaciones similares.
Así ocurrió por ejemplo en 2020, cuando hablaron acerca de unas declaraciones que hizo el artista de metal en una entrevista con Spin en 2009. Entonces dijo que había fantaseado con romperle el brazo a Wood con un mazo y contó que el día de Navidad de 2008 la llamó 158 veces y se cortó todas las veces.
“Cada vez que la llamé ese día, tomé una hoja de afeitar y me corté en la cara o en las manos. Quería mostrarle el dolor por el que me hizo pasar. Fue como, quiero que veas físicamente lo que has hecho”.
En 2020, la revista Metal Hammer preguntó al publicista de Manson sobre aquellos comentarios que había vertido el famoso en 2009. El representante dijo que se trataba de fantasías “teatrales” y no de un deseo real.
“Los comentarios en Spin donde Manson tenía la fantasía de usar un mazo contra Evan y se cortaba 158 veces era obviamente una entrevista teatral de una estrella de rock que promocionaba un nuevo disco, y no un relato fáctico. El hecho de que Evan y Manson se comprometieran seis meses después de esta entrevista indicaría que nadie tomó esta historia literalmente”, dijo el representante.
La primera parte de Phoenix Rising se estrenará en marzo en HBO, y en el documental, Wood recordará otras escenas aterradoras de su vida con Manson.

In a new two-part HBO documentary, ""Phoenix Rising,"" Evan Rachel Wood details the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of her ex-fiancé, Marilyn Manson.
In part one, titled ""Don't Fall,"" which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Sunday (the entire documentary will premiere on HBO in March), Woods showed a photo of an ""M"" scar that she says is on her body, near her pelvic area, that Manson gave her.
After showing the picture of the scar, she said that she wants to get it removed but can't because ""it's evidence.""
The actress also said that she put an ""E"" scar on Manson's body. Wood did not go into detail in the documentary about how either scar was formed.

The pair first met in 2006 at a party at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, Wood said in the documentary. At the time, she was 18 and Manson was 37.
Wood said Manson told her he was a fan of her 2003 movie ""Thirteen,"" in which she played a rebellious teen. It led to the two beginning to see each other regularly, but Wood said in the documentary that it was all in the guise of her and Manson cowriting a script for the musician's now-defunct feature film project ""Phantasmagoria,"" based on the poems of ""Alice in Wonderland"" author Lewis Carroll.
Eventually, Wood said Manson began making the relationship romantic, and the actress said that Manson kissing her was the ""first time a man kissed me in real life,"" as opposed to on-screen kisses.
The two made their relationship public in 2007. They were briefly engaged before their relationship ended in 2010.
In the documentary, Wood described the beginning of their relationship as ""very alluring and you want more.""

Evan Rachel Wood Alleges Marilyn Manson “Essentially Raped” Her While Filming Music Video,"Note: This article details allegations of alleged assault.
The new documentary Phoenix Rising, which focuses on the life and career of Evan Rachel Wood, premiered tonight at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival. It was the first part of a two-part documentary, and Oscar-nominated director Amy Berg clarified that it’s a work in progress. The movie outlines the abuse allegations Wood made against Marilyn Manson last year. It also includes new allegations from Wood.
In the film, Wood discusses the music video for Manson’s 2007 single “Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand).” She starred in the video with Manson; the singer has said that the song was inspired by Wood. “It’s nothing like I thought it was going to be,” Wood recalled of being on the video’s set. “We’re doing things that were not what was pitched to me.” She continued:
“We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real. I had never agreed to that.

I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses. That’s when the first crime was committed against me and I was essentially raped on camera.”
Throughout the first part of Phoenix Rising, Wood discusses many elements of her life with Manson—including allegations that he isolated her from her family and abused her while on tour. Pitchfork has reached out to Manson’s representatives.
Phoenix Rising will air on HBO in March. According to an earlier report from Variety, Wood and Berg worked on the project in secret. Prior to Phoenix Rising, Berg made documentaries about sexual abuse perpetrated by the Catholic Church and against child actors, in addition to HBO’s series The Case Against Adnan Syed.

Evan Rachel Wood témoignera à nouveau contre Marilyn Manson dans un documentaire inédit,"Britney Spears a admis être ""dégoutée"" par sa famille suite à une interview choc donnée par sa soeur Jamie Lynn pour la télévision américaine.
Au cours de cette interview, Jamie Lynn a été interrogée sur la suspension de la tutelle qui encadrait sa soeur depuis plus de dix ans, affirmant face aux caméras de Good Morning America que sa soeur était ""paranoïaque"" et ""en détresse"" avant d'être mise sous tutelle. Elle a notamment révélé que sa soeur l'a jadis enfermée dans une pièce et l'a menacée au couteau.
Évoquant ses mémoires et les révélations qu'elle y fait à propos de Britney, Jamie a déclaré : ""J’avais peur. J’avais aussi très peur de dire quelque chose car je ne voulais contrarier personne.""
Dans son livre, Jamie Lynn affirme aussi que le comportement de Britney au cours de ces 10 dernières années a été ""irrégulier et paranoïaque.""
L’actrice est aussi revenue sur un autre incident durant lequel sa sœur a commencé à lui crier dessus.
Elle a expliqué : ""Elle m’a insultée alors que je quittais la pièce. Nous sommes une famille. Je n’essaie pas de m’embrouiller. Quand j’ai essayé de m’extirper de la situation, c’est là qu’elle est devenue vraiment énervée et ma grande sœur a essayé de jouer la médiatrice. J’ai détesté cela.""
Agacée par les propos de sa soeur, Britney s'est rendue sur Twitter pour faire part de son ressenti.
""Heureusement que j'avais une très grosse fièvre car je n'avais même pas la force de m'en soucier"" a-t-elle déclaré à propos de cette interview. ""Ce qui m'a agacé, c'est que ma soeur a dit que j'étais hors de contrôle. Elle n'était pas souvent avec moi il y a 15 ans. Donc pourquoi parlent-ils de cela si ce n'est pour vendre un livre à mon sujet?""
Britney a également insisté sur le fait que sa soeur n'a jamais eu besoin ""de travailler pour quoique ce soit"" et que ""tout lui a toujours été offert"".
Elle a poursuivi : ""Ma famille a ruiné mon rêve mais essaie de me faire passer pour la folle. Ma famille adore me rabaisser et me blesser, donc ils me dégoutent.""",2022-01-14T14:30:00Z,https://www.lfm.ch,lfm.ch
Evan Rachel Wood to discuss Marilyn Manson allegations in new two-part HBO documentary,"Something went wrong, please try again later.
A new two-part documentary, Phoenix Rising, chronicling the life and career of Evan Rachel Wood is coming to HBO this year.
Directed by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Amy Berg, the documentary will also look at the allegations Wood made against singer Marilyn Manson last year.
In a nutshell
The film was revealed as part of the Sundance Film Festival 2022 season but was reported to have been in production for over two years.
Although a release date has yet to be announced, we do know it will reach screens “in the coming months”.
In a statement from The Sundance Film Festival, the documentary was said to centre on Evan Rachel Wood, who “takes her experience as a survivor of domestic violence to pursue justice, heal generational trauma, and reclaim her story in a culture that instinctively blames women. The film intimately charts her journey as she moves toward naming her infamous abuser for the first time.""
Speaking about the project, Berg told Variety, “It wasn’t about Marilyn Manson, and his whole world. This was about an Erin Brockovich story. We were really focused on telling a story about empowerment, something that would offer resources for women and men who are stuck in abusive situations. And that was what we were making — until she decided to name him publicly.”
It was reported that the documentary was in production prior to Wood's allegations. Because of this, the first part of the two-part story will focus on her career and films while part two, which is still in production, will be based around Wood’s decision to speak out about Manson and the aftermath of that decision.
""Phoenix Rising is a full portrait of Wood, delving into her family life and her career beginnings as a child actor and how she was forced into adulthood from such a young age, like Thirteen, and those roles,” Berg continued.
Background
In 2021, Wood went public with accusations against Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, alleging that the singer “groomed” her as a teenager before he “horrifically abused'' and “brainwashed” her, Vanity Fair reported.
The actor, who was engaged to Manson for a short time in 2010, had previously spoken out about her experiences with domestic abuse, but did not reveal any names. However last year Wood came forward to media outlets and on her social media accounts stating Manson had subjected her to abuse, Pitchfork wrote.
Manson, who is currently being investigated by the LAPD for domestic abuse, has repeatedly denied these allegations.",2022-01-14T10:13:42Z,https://www.buzz.ie,Buzz.ie
Evan Rachel Wood,"With eight days to go before opening night, the Sundance Film Festival has added two world premiere documentaries to this year’s schedule as special screenings. Sundance, which pivoted to a wholly virtual lineup amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, will debut The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales from the directing team of Abigail E. Disney and Kathleen Hughes, and Phoenix Rising from director Amy Berg.
The former, produced by Disney, Hughes and Aideen Kane, is said to be an examination of “why the American dream has worked for the wealthy yet is a nightmare for people born with less.” The festival description says that Disney uses her family’s story as a way to explore the issue, something that is sure to generate a lot of attention. Disney, the granddaughter of Walt Disney Co. co-founder Roy O. Disney, is a filmmaker and outspoken activist who has regularly used her platform to criticize Disney as a corporation.
She also faced a wave of criticism from current and former employees who alleged discrimination and unfair treatment at her company Level Forward, as detailed in a THR investigation last year.
Berg’s Phoenix Rising, produced by Kirsten Sheridan, Nancy Abraham and Lisa Heller, focuses its lens on actress and activist Evan Rachel Wood. It is a two-part documentary that “intimately charts her journey as she moves toward naming her infamous abuser for the first time.” Wood, a multi-hyphenate who segued from child star to leading roles in both features and on television, accused former boyfriend Marilyn Manson last year of abusing her during a three-year relationship. Per Sundance, part one of the film will screen during the fest.
In making the announcement, Kim Yutani, the fest’s director of programming, called the selections “dynamic films,” adding, “These bold, compelling, provocative documentaries tell indelible stories each from a searing first person perspective that we know will spark critical dialogue.”
Sundance is scheduled for Jan. 20-30.

Evan Rachel Wood Documentary Discussing Marilyn Manson Abuse Allegations Added to Sundance 2022,"Today (January 12), the Sundance Film Festival announced a new slate of films to premiere during its 2022 season. Among them is the first act of Phoenix Rising, a two-part documentary about the life and career of Evan Rachel Wood, that will also chronicle the abuse allegations she made against Marilyn Manson last year. According to a report by Variety, the film (directed by Oscar-nominated documentarian Amy Berg) has been in the making for over two years.
Following its Sundance premiere, both parts of the film will air on HBO “in the coming months,” as Variety points out (a release date was not revealed). According to a description on Sundance’s official website, the film “intimately charts [Wood’s] journey as she moves toward naming her infamous abuser for the first time.
Wood made abuse and grooming allegations against Manson early last year, both on social media and in a statement to Vanity Fair. The actor, who was briefly engaged to Manson in 2010, had spoken in the past about surviving domestic abuse, but did not name the alleged perpetrator at that time.
Since Wood came forward, a number of women have made abuse, sexual assault, and misconduct allegations against Manson, including Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco and a former assistant of Manson’s. Both women have filed lawsuits against the singer, and he is currently under investigation by the L.A.P.D. for domestic violence allegations. Manson has previously denied all of the aforementioned allegations.
Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Evan Rachel Wood, Marilyn Manson, and the Sundance Film Festival for further information and comment.

Evan Rachel Wood Documentary to Chronicle Marilyn Manson Allegations,"For more than two years, Oscar-nominated documentarian Amy Berg (“Deliver Us From Evil”) has been secretly working with Evan Rachel Wood on a documentary about Wood’s life as an actor and emergence as an activist — while also documenting her decision to come forward to allege that Marilyn Manson had “horrifically abused” her while they were in a relationship.
The result is “Phoenix Rising,” which was announced on Wednesday as part of this year’s Sundance Film Festival lineup, and will air in two parts on HBO in the coming months.
Though Wood had spoken publicly about her experiences with domestic violence, and in 2019 had created the Phoenix Act, a bill that extends the statute of limitations on domestic violence from three years to five — which passed in California — it wasn’t until Feb. 1, 2021 that she accused Manson as being the perpetrator of that abuse in a post on Instagram.
Manson has denied all wrongdoing, and his representative had no further comment to Variety. But in the aftermath of Wood’s allegations — which opened the floodgates of other Manson accusers — his label, agent, manager and longtime publicist dropped him. Since then, Manson has been the subject of investigations by the Los Angeles Times and Rolling Stone.
In an interview this week, Berg said that Wood — whom she’d known for years through friends — approached her in 2019 about the film that would turn out to be “Phoenix Rising.” At the time, Berg felt that she wasn’t ready to take it on herself, but helped Wood film as she mounted her Phoenix Act campaign in California, and even sought out other potential directors for the documentary. When COVID-19 hit and everything shut down in spring 2020, Berg changed her mind and decided she wanted to helm the project herself.
“It wasn’t about Marilyn Manson, and his whole world,” Berg said of the origins of the project. “This was about an Erin Brockovich story. We were really focused on telling a story about empowerment, something that would offer resources for women and men who are stuck in abusive situations. And that was what we were making — until she decided to name him publicly.”
Berg and Wood — along with, Berg said, “a number of survivors” whom they were filming even before Wood accused Manson — were in production during COVID with a small crew. “It’s a really intimate portrait of Evan, and I had incredible access,” Berg said.
HBO officially signed onto the project in summer 2020. That September, Berg said Wood decided to accuse Manson after his new album came out, and her veiled allegations against him over the years resurfaced. “People started responding on Twitter, standing in support of Evan,” Berg said. They also learned of an FBI investigation into the singer, which other Manson accusers have also cited — though it’s never been officially confirmed, Berg claims that it’s ongoing.
Part 1 of the documentary ends during that time, with Part 2 — which Berg is still working on — focusing on Wood’s decision to come forward and the aftermath of that choice.
“Naming Manson obviously created a lot more story for us. It became a two-part film in the edit bay,” Berg said.
“Phoenix Rising” is a full portrait of Wood, delving into her family life and her career beginnings as a child actor — “and how she was forced into adulthood from such young age — like ‘Thirteen,’ and those roles,” Berg said.
“She’s so candid with us,” Berg said. “And it’s very personal.”",2022-01-12T13:45:14Z,https://variety.com,Variety
¿Por qué ‘Axl Rose’ y ‘Marilyn Manson’ de Yo soy terminaron su amistad por dinero?,"Contó su verdad. César Osorio, polémico artista conocido por imitar al cantante Axl Rose en Yo soy, rompió su silencio en una transmisión en vivo y explicó la razón de su distanciamiento con Mike Bravo, ‘Marilyn Manson’, tras un evento que no llegó a realizarse.
Ambos caracterizadores iban a unir voces para un concierto tributo hace poco, sin embargo, este no pudo llevarse a cabo. Según las declaraciones, existieron tergiversaciones que acabaron por romper vínculos laborales.
Osorio recibió un adelanto económico de 1.500 soles para participar en el show que su colega había organizado y que se canceló por, presuntamente, no haber vendido suficientes entradas.
“Cuando uno hace un adelanto y el evento se le escapa de las manos, el artista nunca devuelve dicho monto, porque se ha proyectado y dedicado su tiempo en trabajar para dicho show”, acotó el cantante.
“No hay devolución de adelanto”, agregó ‘Axl Rose’, señalando que así le respondió a Mike. Del mismo modo, aseguró tener audios como prueba verídica del problema.

Discrepancias entre César Osorio y Mike Bravo
De acuerdo con el imitador del líder de Guns ‘N Roses, Mike habría utilizado como escusa la no vacunación de su colega para que no se lleve a cabo el concierto.
“Me parece estar recontra huev**, para mí, que des como excusa de que yo no estoy vacunado para la cancelación del show, cuando en realidad no vendiste las entradas suficientes”, exclamó el imitador.
“Si el señor no lo quiere aceptar, es su rollo”, sentenció, no sin antes despedirse de los seguidores que veían la transmisión.
De momento, Mike Bravo, ‘Marilyn Manson’, no se ha pronunciado públicamente sobre las declaraciones de su colega.
Axl Rose y Marilyn Manson y su paso por Yo Soy
Como se recuerda, el imitador del intérprete de “Tourniquet” se consagró en marzo del 2021 como ganador de la temporada 2021 de Yo soy. En aquel entonces, él se llevó como premio 15.000 soles y una moto nueva.
Por su parte, César Osorio tuvo un único paso en 2012, caracterizando al cantante de rock. Nueve años después, regresó al programa para el formato de Grandes batallas, donde no logró brillar y fue eliminado en su primera aparición.",2022-01-06T23:07:03Z,https://larepublica.pe,LaRepública.pe
"Marilyn Manson acusado por abuso sexual: drogas, violaciones y la siniestra Habitación de las Chicas Malas","Hoy el músico Marilyn Manson cumple 53 años. Afronta las denuncias ante la justicia por abuso, secuestro y violación de al menos cinco mujeres (Getty Images)
Hoy Brian Hugh Warner cumple 53 años. Su futuro no es promisorio, se ve oscuro. Debe enfrentar graves acusaciones ante la justicia. Y los medios que, durante un cuarto de siglo, lo mostraron como una rareza y difundieron sus excentricidades hasta con aire divertido, ahora sólo lo mencionan para condenarlo. Utilizan su nombre real y no el artístico, por el que es conocido. A esta altura nadie vislumbra cómo Marilyn Manson pueda continuar con su carrera artística. Es un tiempo en el que ciertas acusaciones anulan el camino para siempre (o al menos por una gran cantidad de años). Si las víctimas prueban sus acusaciones (hay elementos y testimonios concordantes que permiten suponerlo) lo esperan varios años de prisión.
En 2018, la actriz Evan Rachel Wood declaró ante un comité del Congreso de Estados Unidos en una de las audiencias previas para la preparación de una ley que establece derechos para las víctimas: “Mi experiencia de violencia doméstica incluyó abuso mental, físico y sexual. Comenzó lentamente pero luego se intensificó. Hubo amenazas contra mi vida, manipulación psicológica, lavado de cerebro, despertarme siendo violada y, la peor parte, rituales enfermizos de atarme manos y pies para ser torturada mental y físicamente hasta que mi abusador sintiera que ya ‘le había demostrado mi amor’. En esos momentos sentí que me podía morir. No sólo porque él me decía: ‘Podría matarte ahora mismo’, sino porque me sentía separada de mi cuerpo. Tenía demasiado miedo para escapar y pensaba que él me iba a encontrar”. La actriz no dio, en ese momento, el nombre de su abusador. En las redes sociales comenzaron las especulaciones. Se pusieron a repasar su pasado amoroso y se mencionaron a los novios que se le habían conocido. El principal sospechoso era Marilyn Manson.
Marilyn Manso y Evan Rachel Wood cuando eran pareja. La actriz denunció ante el congreso norteamerciano violencia doméstica sin dar el nombre del músico. Eso sucedió recién dos años después. A partir de ese momento un aluvión de acusaciones cayeron sobre él (Getty Images)
Pero pasaron más de dos años hasta que Rachel Evans Wood pudo ponerle nombre. Lo hizo a través de una declaración y de posteos en las redes sociales. Aquello que era un rumor se convirtió en certeza. El señalado era el músico. Tras esta denuncia se encadenaron varias más. Ex parejas estables y ocasionales de Manson se reunieron y compartieron sus experiencias traumáticas. Evan Rachel Wood, la también actriz Esmé Bianco, la modelo Sarah McNeilly, Ashley Morgan Smithline y Ashley Walters son las que participaron. Descubrieron que eran muy parecidas. Luego se presentaron ante la justicia y ante la prensa. Con el paso de las semanas se agregaron otras con sus testimonios aunque algunas prefirieron permanecer en el anonimato.
Las consecuencias fueron inmediatas. La discográfica dejó de promocionar su último lanzamiento y rescindió el contrato, su manager renunció, dos series televisivas (American Gods y Creepshow) eliminaron las participaciones especiales que él iba a tener y muchas radios dejaron de pasar sus temas.
El artista emitió un comunicado oficial negando las imputaciones: “Obviamente, mi arte y mi vida han sido durante mucho tiempo imanes para la controversia, pero estas afirmaciones recientes sobre mí son horribles distorsiones de la realidad. Mis relaciones íntimas siempre han sido con consentimiento mutuo y con personas de ideas afines. Es la verdad, independientemente de cómo y por qué algunas personas ahora eligen tergiversar el pasado”.
En 199 Manso fue señalado como uno de los que influyó a través de sus discos en los asesinos de la Masacre de Columbine. Luego apareció en el documental de Michael Moore para refutar esas versiones (Getty Images)
Luego de eso, Manson bajó el perfil público. Casi no realizó presentaciones. Sólo apareció junto a Kanye West, otro provocador, en dos ocasiones. En una de ellas se les sumó Justin Bieber. La batalla, ahora, será judicial. A fines de noviembre del año pasado la policía allanó su casa para comprobar ciertas circunstancias mencionadas en las denuncias de las mujeres involucradas. Aunque no se conoce en detalle el resultado del procedimiento (nadie se sorprendería si se encontraran elementos relacionados con el nazismo, material porno, elementos SBDM y drogas varias- sin olvidar que la posesión de la mayoría de esas cosas no constituye delito alguno), sí trascendió que hallaron algo que aparece en cada relato: La Habitación de las Chicas Malas.
Marilyn Manson, en Hollywood, vivía en lo que había sido la sede de un sello discográfico. Había algunas salas que oficiaban de estudios de grabación. Una de ellas, más pequeña, quedó casi intacta, no fue modificada. Era una especie de cabina de vidrio insonorizada que servía para grabar música electrónica. Esa cabina fue transformada por Manson en una especie de celda de confinamiento solitario en la que desterraba a sus novias y relaciones femeninas que no se portaban bien o que cometían transgresiones según sus propios y enroscados parámetros. Allí las dejaba durante horas, a veces desnudas, haciéndolas sufrir, sin dejarlas salir para comer o ir al baño, maniatadas, mientras las agredía verbalmente o las amenazaba, reteniéndolas contra su voluntad.
Estas revelaciones y muchas otras consigna una investigación periodística exhaustiva que realizaron Kory Grow y Jason Newman para la revista Rolling Stone. La nota titulada Un Monstruo Oculto a la Luz del Día fue publicada en noviembre en Estados Unidos y en español en el número de diciembre de la edición argentina. Allí se acumulan los testimonios de sus víctimas, de testigos y colaboradores. Al músico se lo llama siempre por su apellido real, Warner.
Con Rose McGowan. Durante unos años fueron pareja. Ante la ola de denuncias. ella afirmó que no tenía nada de que acusar a Manson. Que la relación se terminó por el constante abuso de drogas por parte de él. (Getty Images)
El artículo, con más de cincuenta fuentes y muy bien documentado, adolece de lo aquello que suele ocurrir con este tipo de actuaciones públicas. Mezcla mezquindades, excentricidades, actitudes reprochables y delitos. Todo lo que está mal en la vida de Manson se mezcla y sirve como fundamento para la acusación.
Sus detractores se quejan de que Manson se valió de la libertad de expresión en su época de apogeo a mediados de los noventa y a principio del milenio, como si lo que ocurrió después habilitara para restringir a priori esa libertad. O protestan porque la misma revista había llevado a su tapa a Manson en varias ocasiones o que luego de la declaración de Evan Rachel Woods en la comisión legislativa los medios no hubieran dicho que se refería a Manson; olvidan, en este caso, que la víctima eligió no hacerlo y que los medios deben actuar con responsabilidad y no hacerse eco de un rumor.
Brian Wagner nació en Ohio en 1969. Muchos son los que buscan en su infancia la causa de sus conductas privadas una vez que alcanzó la fama. Algunos culpan al abuelo que tenía el sótano repleto de material pornográfico, otros a un padre que no le prestaba demasiada atención y era especialista en proferir frases soeces y están también los que señalan a la madre.
Trent Reznor fue su primer productor. El líder de Nine Inch Nails se peleó con Manson y cruzaron acusaciones a través de los medios(Getty Images)
Wagner en su juventud comenzó a escribir en una revista musical. Luego con unos amigos formó una banda, con la que hacían shows en lugares pequeños y grababa cassettes caseros. Desde el principio se preocupó por la cuestión escénica, por la imagen, por sus ropas extravagantes, el maquillaje cargado, por provocar. Pero no dejaba de ser una estética gótica. La música era metal con toques industriales.
En los primeros shows como el público era escaso les pedían a sus fans que dejaran los datos personales para después comunicarse con ellos. En tiempo de incipiente correos electrónicos, el músico aprovechaba para recibir y enviar material de contenido sexual con sus fans. El primer disco de Manson, Portrait of an American Family cerraba con la canción Misery Machine. En ella se incluía un mensaje grabado en un contestador telefónico por una madre de sus fans: “Quiero a mi hijo fuera de su lista de correo. Me he puesto en contacto con la oficina de correos sobre el material pornográfico que están enviando a mi hijo. No quiero que nos envíen nada más. Si recibo algún material más de esta banda iré a mi abogado. Gracias y adiós”.
Para esa época ya había elegido su nombre artístico. Marilyn Manson. Un ícono de Hollywood, de la sensualidad y de la sexualidad, con un aura trágica y el apellido de un asesino serial, que misteriosamente, se convirtió en objeto de fascinación y de consumo cultural. Cuando la legión de seguidores fue masiva, jugó con el concepto de Familia tal como se llamaban entre sí los cófrades del Clan de Charles Manson.

En 1993, Trent Reznor lo contrató para su discográfica. El líder de Nine Inch Nails también llevó a Marilyn Manson como soporte en su gira por Estados unidos. El disco debut vendió bien aunque el primer gran éxito llegaría con el siguiente, un EP que contenía un cover de Sweet Dreams de Eurythmics. Después saldría su segundo álbum y el suceso masivo. Los medios se mostraban fascinados con su imagen y su mensaje provocador. Funcionaba. Porque a cada manifestación de Manson le sucedía la de un grupo ultraconservador que se le oponía. Y el escándalo se mantenía. Él escandalizaba rompiendo biblias en escena, haciendo referencias sexuales, con videos que mostraban escenas de violaciones, confrontando con los valores tradicionales. Era un provocador que bordeaba el escándalo con referencias veladas (o no tanto) al nazismo (algunos vieron en su casa un barril de Zyklon B expuesto como una antigüedad), al sadomasoquismo y al gore. En el escenario se simulaban agresiones y hasta relaciones violentas con mujeres que rozaban la violación.
El original de ese Ep incluía algunas grabaciones que la discográfica consideró inaceptables y que decidió eliminar muy poco antes de que el disco ingresara a prensa. En uno de esos tracks se escuchaba lo que decía el chofer de Manson, un secuaz de sus salidas junto al guitarrista de la banda, a una chica con la que estaba manteniendo relaciones sexuales y golpeándola –se escuchan golpes y cadenas y gemidos y gritos de dolor de la joven-: “¿Te gusta, no?”. Y el clamor de ella rogándole que la matara, que su vida no valía nada. En otra grabación casera (grababan las relaciones con las chicas sin que las involucradas supieran) una joven describía cómo había abusado de un niño de seis años. Ambas pistas se llamaban Abuse.
Con Trent Reznor la relación terminó mal. Se pelearon e intercambiaron dardos a través de los medios. Pero cuando Manson publicó su autobiografía contó que juntos habían abusado de una chica. Reznor negó la acusación, afirmó que se trataba de un invento y dijo: “Es un tipo malicioso y pisará la cara de cualquiera para tener éxito y cruzar cualquier línea de la decencia”.
Esmé Bianco, actriz de Game Of Thrones, declaró que fue golpeada, atada, electrocutada y violada por Manson. Y que el último día de su relación él la persiguió con un hacha por toda la casa (Getty Images)
En 1999 todo pareció cambiar. La Masacre de Columbine lo puso en el ojo de la tormenta. Lo acusaron de ser el inspirador de los chicos asesinos que mataron a doce estudiantes. Que su música los había empujado a la masacre. Manson desestimó las acusaciones (los culpables de la masacre ni siquiera escuchaban sus discos). Tuvo su gran tribuna en Bowling For Columbine, el documental de Michael Moore. Allí se defendió. Lo hizo con tino, sin provocaciones absurdas y separando su acto de la vida privada. Demostró que sus acusadores lo habían elegido a él de antemano. Lo que Moore no comprendió es que si la acusación de los ultraconservadores que lo señalaban era absurda, eso no convertía a Manson en paradigma de nada. Pero paradójicamente esas declaraciones y la sobreexposición desarmaron el personaje y muchos lo vieron de manera diferente a partir de ese momento. Ese personaje provocador se convirtió con el paso del tiempo en una caricatura. O tal vez siempre lo fue y recién en ese momento se lo vio.
Lo cierto es que en su vida personal la misantropía lo había ganado definitivamente. Su conducta era errática, incomprensible y en muchos casos delictiva. Las acciones con sus parejas, según la mayoría de los testimonios, se asemejan. Rose McGowan que fue su pareja cuando ella tenía 24 años dijo que con ella no tuvo ninguna conducta abusiva. Pero, al ser una de las referentes del Movimiento Me Too a través de su actuación en el caso Weinstein, también afirmó que acompañaba a las víctimas y les creía. Ditta Von Teese fue la otra expareja que afirmó que no tenía ningún delito para denunciar: “Los detalles que se han hecho públicos no coinciden con mi experiencia personal”. Ambas aclararon que la relación se acabó por el consumo desbocado de drogas por parte de él.
“No sé qué tipo de dolor experimenta. Pero lo único que quiere es que la gente sienta ese dolor una y otra vez”, dijo Sarah McNeilly, una de las denunciantes (Getty Images)
Las mujeres que lo denunciaron tardaron años en poder hacerlo. Tuvieron que superar el dolor, el miedo y hasta la culpa que sentían. Una de ellas Sarah McNeilly le dijo a la Rolling Stone: “La violencia física fue casi un alivio. La mierda mental por la que te hace pasar, que infecta tu cerebro, solo querés que pare alguna vez”.
Tras la declaración de Evan Rachel Wood, otras de las ex parejas de Manson se comunicaron entre sí y compartieron sus experiencias. Sintieron que todas habían pasado por situaciones similares. Agresiones, encierros contra su voluntad, amenazas de muerte, despertarse encontrándose atadas y siendo violadas por él. Otras contaron que las drogó y las entregó a amigos suyos. Todas pudieron describir a la perfección La Habitación de las Chicas Malas. Ashley Walters, una de ellas, contó sobre ese encuentro entre exparejas de Manson: “Una vez que empezamos a hablar nos fuimos poniendo pálidas, creo que todas pensamos: Eso también me pasó. Creía que era la única”. Esmé Bianco, actriz de Game of Thrones, mantuvo con el músico una relación de dos años. Narró las vejaciones que sufrió. Fue mordida, cortada, azotada y hasta electrocutada sin su consentimiento. Además de sufrir varias violaciones. El episodio final, el que quebró su renuencia a escapar y cuando sintió que su vida estaba en serio riesgo, se dio después de una discusión en la casa de Manson. Él la empezó a perseguir con un hacha con la que abría boquetes en las paredes mientras la amenazaba.
“No sé qué tipo de dolor experimenta. Pero lo único que quiere es que la gente sienta ese dolor una y otra vez”, dijo Sarah McNeilly.

"Beskriver torturkammer: Sultet, voldtatt og neddopet","Brian Warner (52) er beskrevet som en stille gutt som ung. En som oppdaget rockemusikk og ønsket å lære alt han kunne om musikksjangeren.
- Det første jeg tenkte om ham var at han sannsynligvis fikk mye juling som barn. Han hadde mye sinne og fiendtlighet, men han var en veldig stille person, du vet – en som du forventer kommer til å ende opp som seriemorder en dag, forteller Paul Gallotta til magasinet Rolling Stone.

Han er redaktør av musikkmagasinet 25th Parallel, hvor Warner jobbet i en periode som ung.
Rolling Stone har laget en stor sak om han som er best kjent for offentligheten som Marilyn Manson. Gjennom intervjuer med 55 kilder, samt rettsdokumenter, har de gått i dybden på Mansons liv og angivelige ugjerninger.
En scenekarakter som er besatt av frykt og vold og kvinnehat. Med et navn som kombinerer Hollywood-yndling Marilyn Monroe og massemorderen Charles Manson.
De senere årene har imidlertid vist at Brian Warner og Marilyn Manson tilsynelatende hadde mye til felles.

Skrekk-kammer
I 2010 leide Manson en leilighet i vest-Hollywood, som lå over en spritsjappe. Flere beskriver leiligheten overfor Rolling Stone som et langt fra lyst og lystig oppholdssted. Dekorert med blod, nazisymboler, bilder utklipt fra pornomagasiner.
- Det var vaginaer overalt, sier en ikke-navngitt kilde til magasinet.
Svarte tepper, svarte møbler og svarte gardiner som dekker for det kaliforniske sollyset til enhver tid. Det skal ha vært spraymalt ordet «AIDS» over sengen på soverommet.
Temperaturen skulle på ingen måte minne om den utenfor veggene, den skal ha vært permanent innstilt på 18 varmegrader - og nåde dem som skulle forsøke å endre på det, ifølge magasinet. Ord som «svart kjøleskap» og «kjølerom» brukes for å beskrive Mansons tilfluktssted.

Men det som virkelig får hårene til å reise seg for besøkende, som ikke hadde noe med temperaturen å gjøre, var det som ble omtalt som «Bad Girls' Room» - rommet for jenter som ikke oppførte seg.
Et lydtett glassrom som opprinnelig ble brukt av den tidligere eieren til å spille inn elektronisk musikk. Men for Manson hadde det angivelig et helt annet bruksområde.
- Hvis noen oppfører seg dårlig, så kan jeg bare låse dem inne, og det er lydtett, skal han selv ha sagt til et magasin i 2012.
- Først fikk han det til å høres kult ut. Så fikk han det til å høres veldig primitivt ut. Selv om jeg skrek, ville ingen høre meg. Først kjemper du imot, og han liker det. Jeg lærte meg å ikke kjempe imot, for det betydde å gi ham det han ville ha. Jeg dro bare et annet sted i hodet mitt.

Det sier Ashley Morgan Smithline til Rolling Stone. Hun er en annen kvinne som har saksøkt Manson - for voldtekt og ulovlig fangehold.
I søksmålet står det blant annet at han tvang henne til å være våken ved å gi henne kokain, og at han nektet henne mat for å gjøre henne svakere psykisk og fysisk. Hun skal ha gått ned masse i vekt - til hun til slutt veide bare 36 kilo.
Beskriver tortur
Flere kvinner har stått frem med grusomme historier om brutale voldtekter. Blant dem er «Westworld»-stjerne Evan Rachel Wood, som gikk inn i et forhold med Manson da hun var 18 år.
«Navnet på min misbruker er Brian Warner, også kjent for verden som Marilyn Manson», skrev hun i et Instagram-innlegg i februar.

Tre år tidligere hadde hun imidlertid fortalt mer detaljert om overgrepene hun ble utsatt for, men da uten å navngi Manson. Det gjorde hun under en høring for rettskomiteen i Kongressen.
- Giftig psykisk og fysisk vold, seksuelt misbruk, som startet sakte, men eskalerte over tid, inkludert dødstrusler, alvorlig «gaslighting» og hjernevask. Jeg våknet opp til at en mann som hevdet å elske meg, voldtok det han trodde var min bevisstløse kropp, og den verste delen - syke ritualer som å henge meg etter hender og føtter, for å bli mentalt og fysisk torturert, frem til min mishandler følte at jeg hadde bevist min «kjærlighet», var blant det hun fortalte, ifølge People.
Flere enn et dusin kvinner har kommet ut med anklager mot Manson, skriver Rolling Stone. Fire har saksøkt ham.
Warner har hele veien nektet for alle anklagene mot seg, og hevder at hans intime relasjoner har vært med samtykke.

Etter anklagene fikk han støtte fra ekskona Dita Von Teese, som på Instagram sa at hun aldri hadde opplevd mishandling av eksmannen. Hun ga også sin støtte til ofre av overgrep, og sa hun var stolt over dem som hadde stått frem i Manson-saken. Dette innlegget er nå slettet.
- Ingen prøvde å stoppe ham
Manson har i alle år provosert med drøye sceneshow, sangtekster om voldtekt og forstyrrende musikkvideoer.
I sin egen biografi «The Long Hard Road Out of Hell» beskriver han et overgrep av en kvinne, begått av ham selv og «Nine Inch Nails»-vokalist Trent Reznor, som selv har nektet for dette. De fleste har hele veien tolket det som sjokkeffekt, men de senere historiene tyder på noe annet.

- Frykt er noe jeg gir andre mennesker, som regel unge jenter, uttalte han en gang til The Guardian.
Mange av dem magasinet har intervjuet sier det samme - han fortalte alle hva slags monster han faktisk var, men det var ingen som trodde det var virkelig.
- Det er delvis årsaken til at han kom unna med det i så lang tid - fordi ofrene hans følte seg så totalt skamfulle at de ikke forsto hva som hadde skjedd dem, før det var for sent. Han fortalte det til hele verden, og ingen prøvde å stoppe ham, sier Esmé Bianco til Rolling Stone.

Hun er kjent fra «Game of Thrones»-universet som prostituerte Ros, og gikk ut med sin opplevelse av Manson i april. Hun møtte rockeren i 2005 gjennom hans daværende kone Dita Von Teese, men de to innledet først et forhold i 2009.
Da ble hun flydd til Los Angeles av Manson for å være med i musikkvideoen hans «I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies», som handler om ekskjæresten hans, Wood.
Bianco er blant dem som har saksøkt Manson, og skriver i søksmålet at hun ble dopet ned med alkohol og narkotika før hun ble utsatt for vold og voldtekt. Så beskriver hun å bli bundet fast og slått med en pisk som Manson hevdet var brukt av nazister. Hun hevder også å ha blitt utsatt for elektrisk sjokk.

Alt dette skulle være en del av musikkvideoen, skal Manson ha forklart.
Det var senere i 2009 at de to innledet et forhold. De hadde et langdistanseforhold i to år, hvor Bianco hevder å ha blitt utsatt for flere overgrep, søvnmangel og mental terror.
- Han tok en øks og begynte å slå hull i veggen, og så begynte han å jage meg med den. På det tidspunktet trodde jeg at han skulle drepe meg, har hun fortalt til Good Morning America.
Flere søksmål
Selv om Manson nå står overfor fire ferske søksmål, som foreløpig ikke har blitt avgjort, er det ikke første gang han er i samme posisjon.
Han ble i 2001 saksøkt for å ha forgrepet seg på en sikkerhetsvakt, hvor fornærmede hevdet at han spyttet på ham og gnikket på ham under en konsert - bare iført g-streng. Manson nektet for dette, og partene kom til forlik utenfor retten.

Året etter ble han saksøkt for å ha dopet ned skuespiller Jennifer Syme, som døde etter å ha kjørt i ruspåvirket tilstand. Også dette nektet Manson for.
I 2018 ble det levert inn politianmeldelse mot Manson i kjølvannet av #MeToo-bevegelsen, men ble henlagt av politiet da foreldelsesfristen var utløpt.
En ikke-navngitt ekskjæreste saksøkte Manson i mai for voldtekt, og en tidligere assistent gjorde det samme, samme måned. Alle fire søksmål er fortsatt pågående.

Evan Rachel Wood Claims Marilyn Manson Threatened to 'F***' Her Son,"Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood accused Marilyn Manson of abuse earlier this year. Now, she claims he has threatened her family in retaliation for her speaking out against him. Here’s what Wood said about the musician in court documents.

Evan Rachel Wood previously accused her ex Marilyn Manson of abuse
On Feb. 1, 2021, Wood made an Instagram post accusing her former fiancé of abuse. She claimed he was “grooming” her as a teenager and “horrifically abused [her] for years.” Wood also said in her post that she was “brainwashed and manipulated into submission” by Manson.
The same day Wood posted her allegations against Manson, the musician created his own Instagram post denying all accusations. He called the claims “horrible distortions of reality.”
On Oct. 5, Wood made another Instagram post encouraging fans to contact law enforcement about Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner. She posted the phone numbers of the District Attorney and the Attorney General of Los Angeles and captioned the images, “Swipe for the numbers to call. Leave a message. Ask what is being done in the case against Brian Warner aka Marilyn Manson. Or email info@da.lacounty.gov.”

Evan Rachel Wood claimed in court documents that Marilyn Manson threatened her son
Since accusing Manson of abuse, Wood said that the musician threatened to “f***” her 8-year-old son. Woods shared this information in court documents regarding a custody battle with her ex Jamie Bell.
“I took his threat seriously, then and now,” Wood said (per Daily Mail). She stated that Manson’s threats made her install bulletproof windows, a security fence, and a steel door at her home. She is also “looking into attack dogs and security guards at night.”
Wood explained that another of Manson’s alleged victims had a recording of him saying he had her children’s social security numbers and photos of them checking their mailbox. Manson allegedly said in the recording, “I’ve got everything, they’re f**ked, and they’re going to be f***ing destroyed.”
The Frozen 2 star stated in court documents, “I am extremely afraid of the alleged offender. I have suffered severe traumatic physical and emotional injury at his hands, and I am afraid he will seek retribution against me for testifying by harming me, our son, and members of my family.”
She added, “In my experience, the alleged offender is very retaliatory and has always made it clear that he will ruin my life.”

The ‘Westworld’ actor said her musician ex is involved in human trafficking
Wood said that she fears for her son not only because Manson allegedly threatened another of his accuser’s children but also because she said her ex “was involved in human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of minors on a large scale.”
Wood said she moved from California to Nashville, Tennessee because she was afraid of Manson.
“These new developments, combined with the pending criminal investigation, lead me to be very concerned about our child’s safety when in Los Angeles,” Wood stated.

"Marilyn Manson Sold His 2,711-Square-Foot LA Mansion for $1.8 Million Over Asking","Marilyn Manson was born Brian Hugh Warner on January 5, 1969. Since then, he’s become a controversial singer, songwriter, actor, painter, and writer. In the ’90s, he released top-selling albums like Portrait of an American Family, Antichrist Superstar, and Mechanical Animals. Contentious or not, no one can deny his success.
Therefore, when Manson’s LA home hit the market in October 2021, it wasn’t a surprise to learn it was picked up quickly. However, the actual purchase price did surprise a few people; it brought in $1.8 million more than expected.

Manson’s Spanish-style estate has three bedrooms and three baths, according to Variety. Small by some standards, one look inside proves that this 1926 home is anything but tiny and far from simple.
It has massive 20-foot ceilings, a newly updated kitchen, a formal dining room, and plenty of space for entertaining guests. There is also a home gym and a library with built-in cabinetry. The older style of the home gives it plenty of character. There are spiral staircases, a huge living room, and decks on each of the three levels.
Outside the main home, there are lush, private grounds, a swimming pool, and trails that allow you to wander around the property.
Why Manson’s impressive home sold for $1.8 million more than expected
Manson bought this house in 2013 for $1,085,000. It is located in Hollywood Hills and where Manson has lived for most of his life. Therefore, many were surprised when he put his home up for sale and moving trucks arrived.
According to People, the home was first listed on the market in early October 2021 with a list price of $1,750,000. Just over a month later, the mansion sold for $1,835,000. There is no current word on where he may be moving to next, but this is not the first time he sold a home in the area.
In 2015, he sold a Mediterranean-style home in Chatsworth, California, for $1,100,000. It was a sprawling 4,484 square feet and had five bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms. There are rumors that he sold the home in the aftermath of school shootings in Columbine because of heat regarding his music and its potentially negative influence.
Why did Manson sell his LA mansion?
Earlier this year, there were rumors of someone calling out from Manson’s house, which prompted a wellness check to be called to his home. He did not answer, but a representative of his said he was fine and there wasn’t anything going on.
However, according to People, Manson’s abrupt sale came at the end of allegations of sexual assault and physical abuse. There are currently three charges pending with approximately 15 women who have publicly accused Manson of forcing them to do things that may not have been consensual.
Manson has denied the allegations, claiming that intimate relationships were always consensual and with like-minded partners. He has also stated that the claims against him are “horrible distortions of reality.” However, his ex-girlfriends Ashley Morgan Smithline and Esme Bianco are among two of the people claiming otherwise. The third woman is Evan Rachel Wood, a three-time Golden Globe nominee.
At the time of the home’s listing, the charges were still pending against Manson. Another claim by “Jane Doe” has officially been dismissed due to the statute of limitations expiring before charges were brought up.

"Marilyn Manson: Ex behauptet, er drohte, ihren Sohn zu vergewaltigen","In den vergangenen Monaten haben mehr als ein Dutzend Frauen Vorwürfe oder Klagen gegen Schockrocker Marilyn Manson (52) vorgebracht – wegen sexueller, psychischer oder auch körperlicher Gewalt. Die Polizei leitete daraufhin eine Untersuchung ein, untersuchte schon sein Haus in Los Angeles nach Beweisen.
Die Frau, die den Stein Anfang des Jahres ins Rollen brachte, ist Mansons Ex-Freundin Evan Rachel Wood (34). Und von ihr kommen nun erneut unglaubliche Anschuldigungen. Sie behauptet: Der Sänger habe sie gequält, indem er ihr mit der Vergewaltigung ihres kleinen Sohnes drohte.
Diese furchtbare Aussage machte die Schauspielerin laut „Daily Mail“ im Rahmen eines Sorgerechtsstreites mit ihrem Ex-Lebensgefährten Jamie Bell (35, „Billy Elliot – I Will Dance“). Er hatte behauptet, Wood sei von Los Angeles nach Nashville umgezogen, um ihm den gemeinsamen Sohn Jack (8) zu entziehen.

Alles Quatsch, bestritt die 34-Jährige. Schuld an ihrem Umzug sei ihr Ex Marilyn Manson gewesen. „Er wird meinen achtjährigen Sohn fi****“, habe der ihr laut Gerichtsunterlagen, die der Zeitung vorliegen, gedroht. „Ich habe seine Drohung ernst genommen – damals wie heute.“
Marilyn Manson soll mehrere Familien von Frauen bedroht haben, die ihn der sexuellen Nötigung und Vergewaltigung beschuldigt hatten, heißt es.

Seine furchtbaren Drohungen hätten sie sogar dazu gezwungen, kugelsichere Glasfenster und eine Stahltür in ihr Haus in Los Angeles einzubauen, es zudem mit einem Sicherheitszaun zu schützen, gab Wood zu Protokoll. „Ich denke sogar über Kampfhunde und Sicherheitspersonal für die Nacht nach.“
Die neuesten Erkenntnisse und die laufenden Ermittlungen gegen Marilyn Manson hätten sie „noch mehr um die Sicherheit unseres Kindes fürchten lassen“. Mit dem Umzug habe sie sich und ihren Sohn vor dem Schockrocker schützen wollen.

„Ich habe große Angst vor ihm. Er hat mir traumatischen körperlichen und seelischen Schaden zugefügt“, sagte Marilyn Mansons Ex.
„Ich habe Angst, dass er sich an mir rächen will, wenn ich gegen ihn aussage, indem er mir, unserem Sohn und Mitgliedern meiner Familie Schaden zufügt.“
Der Sänger weist alle Vorwürfe sexueller, psychischer und physischer Gewalt von sich. Die Behauptungen über ihn seien „schreckliche Verfälschungen der Realität“, schrieb er auf Instagram Foto: picture alliance / Evan Agostini
Auch die Kinder eines anderen Opfers habe Manson bedroht, sagte Evan Rachel Wood aus. „Er sagte ihr, dass er Fotos ihrer Kinder habe und auch deren Versicherungsnummern. Er sagte: ‚Ich habe alles, sie sind am Ar***. Ich werde sie verdammt noch mal vernichten!‘“
Manson sei sehr rachsüchtig, so seine Ex. Schon früher habe er ihr angeblich immer wieder deutlich gemacht, „dass er mein Leben ruinieren wird“ und gesagt, dass er wisse, wo all die Leute seien, die „seine Probleme verursacht“ hätten.
Und nicht nur von Marilyn Manson, sondern auch von fanatischen Fans werde sie bedroht, sagte Evan Rachel Wood und legte zum Beweis vor Gericht Nachrichten vor. In einer hieß es: „Wenn du mir Manson nimmst, dann nehme ich dir dein Leben!“.",2021-12-08T18:43:43Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD

Erneut erhebt Evan Rachel Wood schwere Vorwürfe gegen ihren Ex Marilyn Manson (52). Laut neuen Gerichtsdokumenten, die der «Daily Mail» vorliegen, soll der Grusel-Rocker der 34-Jährigen nämlich angedroht haben, ihren achtjährigen Sohn zu misshandeln. Laut dem britischen Medium stammen die Akten aus dem Sorgerechtsprozess gegen Woods Ex-Mann Jamie Bell (35).
Weiter heisst es in den Unterlagen vom April, dass die angeblichen Drohungen des Schock-Rockers die junge Mutter dazu bewegten, die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen in und um ihr Haus zu verstärken.

«Ich habe Angst, dass er sich rächen wird»
Von ihrem Ex-Mann Jamie Bell wird Wood vorgeworfen, sie wolle ihm den Kontakt zum gemeinsamen Sohn durch den Umzug erschweren. Doch dies dementierte die 34-Jährige vor Gericht wie folgt: «Ich habe erfahren, dass Manson in Sex-Sklaverei und Menschenhandel von Minderjährigen involviert sein soll. Diese neuen Erkenntnisse und die laufenden Ermittlungen gegen ihn haben mich noch mehr um die Sicherheit unseres Kindes fürchten lassen.»
Auch die Schauspielerin selbst habe «extreme Angst» vor dem «mutmasslichen Straftäter», wie sie es ausdrückt. Und weiter: «Ich bin sehr besorgt um die Sicherheit unseres Sohnes, wenn ich in Los Angeles bin.» Ausserdem habe Wood Angst, dass ihre Aussage vor Gericht Konsequenzen für sie haben könnte: «Durch ihn habe ich schwere, traumatische körperliche und seelische Verletzungen erlitten. Ich habe Angst, dass er sich an mir rächen wird, wenn ich aussage, indem er mir, unserem Sohn und Mitgliedern meiner Familie Schaden zufügt», so die 34-Jährige.

Vorwürfe seit Februar

Er hat mich jahrelang auf schreckliche Weise misshandelt. Ich wurde einer Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und zur Unterwerfung manipuliert. Ich habe es satt, in Angst vor Vergeltung, Verleumdung oder Erpressung zu leben.»
Marilyn Manson hat die Misshandlungsvorwürfe bislang immer zurückgewiesen.

Marilyn Manson - Απειλεί να βιάσει τον 8χρονο γιο γνωστής ηθοποιού,"Νέα στοιχεία έρχονται στο φως της δημοσιότητας για τον Marilyn Manson. Μετά τις αποκαλύψεις του περιοδικού «Rolling Stone» ότι ο τραγουδιστής κυνηγούσε τις συντρόφους του με τσεκούρια, τις βίαζε και τις κακοποιούσε τόσο ψυχολογικά όσο και σεξουαλικά, η ηθοποιός Έβαν Ρέιτσελ Γουντ αναφέρει ότι ο 8χρονος γιος της κινδυνεύει από τον 52χρονο.
Η 34χρονη τον Φεβρουάριο κατήγγειλε τον Manson, του οποίου το πραγματικό όνομα είναι Brian Warner, για κακοποίηση και τώρα ο τραγουδιστής της ζητά να ανακαλέσει αλλιώς την απειλεί πως θα βιάσει το παιδί της.
Συγκεκριμένα, η Έβαν Ρέιτσελ Γουντ υποστηρίζει πως της στέλνει απειλητικά μηνύματα με τις φωτογραφίες του 8χρονου, που είναι καρπός του έρωτά της με τον πρώην σύζυγό της Τζέιμι Μπελ.
Όπως αναφέρουν οι καταθέσεις της ηθοποιού, είναι τρομοκρατημένη και γι΄αυτό αναγκάστηκε να μετακομίσει μαζί με τον μικρό από το Λος Άντζελες στο Nashville και να προσλάβει ασφάλεια, προκειμένου να προστατεύσει το παιδί της από τον «βίαιο» Μέριλιν Μάνσον.
Σημειώνεται ότι Έβαν Ρέιτσελ Γουντ και Marilyn Manson είχαν σχέση από το 2006 ως το 2010
«Έχω υποφέρει στα χέρια του, τόσο σωματικά, όσο και συναισθηματικά. Με έχει τραυματίσει και φοβάμαι ότι θα ψάξει τρόπο να με εκδικηθεί είτε κάνοντας κακό σε εμένα, είτε στον γιο μου, είτε σε κάποιο άλλο μέλος της οικογένειάς μου», δήλωσε η ίδια σε γραπτή της κατάθεση και ζήτησε να μπει σε πρόγραμμα προστασίας μαρτύρων.
Ο πρώην σύζυγός της, Τζέιμι Μπελ, ο οποίος και διεκδικεί την επιμέλεια του γιου τους, βρήκε «πάτημα στους ισχυρισμούς της, δηλώνοντας ανήσυχος για την ασφάλειά του όσο ο 8χρονος ζει με την ηθοποιό.
«Πραγματικά, δεν καταλαβαίνω τι συμβαίνει. Αν η Έβαν λεέι αλήθεια σε όλα αυτά και λαμβάνει απειλητικά μηνύματα για την ίδια, αλλά και τον Τζακ, τότε γιατί ζει μαζί του, παίρνοντάς τον από την ασφάλεια που του παρέχω εγώ;», δήλωσε ο ίδιος στην Daily Mail.

«Το όνομα του κακοποιητή μου είναι Brian Warner»
Με μία ανάρτηση στο προσωπικό της προφίλ στο Instagram η ηθοποιός τον Φεβρουάριο αποκάλυψε ότι ήταν θύμα ψυχολογικής κακοποίησης για πολλά χρόνια από τον Manson.
Η σχέση τους έγινε γνωστή το 2007, όταν εκείνη ήταν 19 και εκείνος 38. Το 2010 αρραβωνιάστηκαν και επτά μήνες μετά χώρισαν.
Στην ανάρτησή της γράφει: «Το όνομα του κακοποιητή μου είναι Brian Warner ή όπως είναι γνωστός σε όλο τον κόσμο Marilyn Manson. Από την εφηβεία μου και για πολλά χρόνια με κακοποιούσε ψυχικά. Μου έκανε πλύση εγκεφάλου και με χειραγωγούσε κατ’ επανάληψη.
Έχω τελειώσει με το να ζω μέσα στον φόβο, στα αντίποινα, στις συκοφαντίες και τους εκβιασμούς. Είμαι εδώ για να πω για να κατονομάσω αυτόν τον επικίνδυνο άνθρωπο και για τις βιομηχανίες που του επέτρεψαν να το κάνει αυτό, προτού καταστρέψει κι άλλες ζωές.

Marilyn Manson: la caída al infierno del fantoche del rock,"Hubo un tiempo en el que Marilyn Manson sedujo a cierta intelectualidad. Mentes preclaras de gustos retorcidos, como los cineastas David Lynch o Tim Burton, el actor Shia LaBeouf, el documentalista Michael Moore o el gurú del rock avanzado y cabecilla del grupo Nine Inch Nails, Trenz Reznor. Todos admiraron la tenebrosa personalidad de Brian Hugh Warner, nombre real del músico (Ohio, Estados Unidos, 52 años). Lynch llegó a decir de él que le parecía “un artista sensacional”. Quizá lo fuera, con discos como Antichrist Superstar (1997) y canciones como The Beautiful People. Hoy ya no: a una decadencia artística se han sumado las denuncias de acoso sexual contra el cantante, entre ellas las de exparejas como las actrices Evan Rachel Wood, Esmé Bianco o la modelo Ashley Morgan Smithline .
Más información La policía busca pruebas en la casa de Marilyn Manson, acusado de abuso sexual y violencia machista
Estos días se ha publicado un informe detalladísimo en la revista Rolling Stone con algunos pasajes terroríficos. El extenso reportaje se titula Marilyn Manson: Un monstruo escondido ante nuestros ojos. La cosa está tomando un cariz severo: este periódico se ha puesto en contacto con uno de los dos autores, el periodista Kory Grow, que ha declinado amablemente realizar declaraciones “por cuestiones legales”. En el artículo, varias mujeres narran las supuestas atrocidades a las que les sometía el cantante. Muchas de ellas ocurridas en una dependencia de su casa en West Hollywood que ellas aseguran que el cantante denomina “la habitación de las chicas malas”. Las demandas ya están puestas y la investigación sigue su curso. Hace diez días la policía irrumpió en la mansión del cantante en busca de pruebas.
El músico en el festival británico de Reading en 2001. Brian Rasic (Getty Images)
Las provocaciones del músico durante 30 años de carrera adquieren ahora un tono siniestro. En 2009 declaró al diario británico The Guardian: “El miedo es algo que inculco en otras personas, en su mayoría chicas jóvenes”. Nadie se rasgó las vestiduras: es Marilyn Manson, ya se sabe, un fantoche. Su primer disco, Portrait of an American Family (1994), se cierra con la canción Misery Machine. Al final del tema se incluye, en tono burlesco, un mensaje de voz telefónico de una madre preocupada por su hijo. En aquella época, Marilyn Manson estaba comenzando su carrera y para mantener el contacto con sus escasos seguidores les pedía al final del concierto su dirección con el objetivo de enviarles fotos y material promocional. El mensaje de la madre dice: “Quiero a mi hijo fuera de su lista de correo. Me he puesto en contacto con la oficina de correos sobre el material pornográfico que están enviando a mi hijo. No quiero que nos envíen nada más. Si recibo algún material más de esta banda iré a mi abogado. Gracias y adiós”. Otra de las demandantes, la modelo Sarah McNeilly, señala en Rolling Stone: “La violencia física fue casi un alivio. La mierda mental por la que te hace pasar, que infecta tu cerebro, solo quieres que se detenga”.
El éxito de Marilyn Manson se forjó en los noventa en dos direcciones: hacerse un hueco en la nueva ola del metal que se vivía en aquellos momentos (Pantera, Korn, Alice In Chain, Sepultura. Nine Inch Nails…), y proyectar una imagen truculenta y sangrienta. El plan era provocar y los truculentos vídeos que pasaban por televisión le permitió entrar en los hogares de los estadounidenses. Sus ataques a la religión, sus mensajes sobre una población alienada por el poder, su gusto por el sadomasoquismo cutre… Demasiado para las familias más conservadoras. Le pusieron en la diana. Paralelamente un grupo de artistas respetados se sintió atraído por su imagen turbia y sus mensajes antiestablishment. Entre otros, Trenz Reznor, figura reivindicada por David Bowie, que fichó al grupo para su sello; o David Lynch, que incluye su versión de un tema de Screamin Jay Hawkins, I Put a Spell On You, en su película Carretera perdida (1997). Con Lynch la relación discurrió fluida durante un tiempo: en 2010 inauguraron la exposición conjunta Genealogías del dolor. Manson aportaba cuadros de figuras deformadas y Lynch las acompañaba de vídeos.

Y luego está su participación en el documental de Michael Moore Bowling for Columbine (2002). Hay un momento en este filme que funciona como termómetro de lo popular que era Marilyn Manson en esa época. Buscando un ideólogo involuntario de aquella tragedia que se saldó con 12 estudiantes muertos debido a los disparos de Eric Harris y Dylan Klebold (ambos de 18 años), la ultraderecha señaló a Marilyn Manson. ¿Por qué? Se dijo que los asesinos eran seguidores del rockero y que las letras, las declaraciones y la estética de Manson generaron una mala influencia en ellos. No se aportaron pruebas. Michel Moore entrevistó al músico para el documental en una especie de pasillo de un vestuario, quizá el improvisado camerino de un concierto de la estrella en un recinto deportivo. Mientras Manson daba explicaciones de por qué le habían elegido a él, Moore, por entonces azote de la derecha estadounidense, asentía con la cabeza de forma continuada. Manson le estaba convenciendo. Era un tipo locuaz, inteligente, un conejillo de Indias perfecto que funcionaba como cortina de humo para no responsabilizar a un país con grandes dosis de violencia y que permitía venta de armas en los supermercados. Eso daba a entender Moore con sus cabezazos de asentimiento.

Musicalmente, sus dos mejores obras fueron Antichrist Superstar (1996) y Holy Wood (2000). De este último, el crítico Alec Chillingworth dijo en la revista referencial del género duro Metal Hammer: “Una hazaña artística gigantesca que pasará a la historia como la declaración definitoria de Manson”. Pero quizá la música que más se escuche en el mundo de este artista sean sus recreaciones de clásicos. Como Sweet Dreams, de Eurythmics; Personal Jesus, de Depeche Mode; Tainted Love, de Soft Cell, o Rock and Roll Nigger, de Patti Smith. La música de Manson se entiende en un periodo concreto, de mediados de los noventa a principios de los 2000, cuando el heavy metal se moderniza, recogiendo ritmos y sonidos de la música electrónica e industrial. Al final de la primera década de los 2000 su popularidad se empezó a quebrar. Lo comprobamos en España en 2009 con un desastroso concierto en el festival Kobetasonik de Bilbao y en diciembre del mismo año en la actuación más desangelada que se recuerda en el Palacio de los Deportes de Madrid (hoy WiZink Center). Sus fanfarronadas ya no resultaban peligrosas y su actitud errática hizo descender sus conciertos al terreno de la caricatura. Trenz Reznor ya se había apartado de él. “Es un tipo malicioso y pisará la cara de cualquiera para tener éxito y cruzar cualquier línea de la decencia”, señaló a la revista Mojo el líder de Nine Inch Nails.

Los abogados del músico no paran de negar “categóricamente” las acusaciones de acoso. Él escribió en su cuenta de Instagram: “Mis relaciones íntimas siempre han sido completamente consensuadas y con parejas afines. Esa es la verdad, independientemente de cómo y por qué otros ahora eligen tergiversar el pasado”. También se ha pronunciado la actriz y diseñadora de moda Dita Von Teese, que tuvo una relación con Manson de seis años, matrimonio incluido: “Los detalles que se han hecho públicos no coinciden con mi experiencia personal”. En cuanto se hicieron públicas las acusaciones, su manager le dejó y su sello discográfico le despidió. Marilyn Manson no tiene conciertos programados para los próximos meses.
Su última aparición pública, el pasado 1 de noviembre, se produjo en una situación, cuanto menos, llamativa: todo vestido de blanco, con capucha y la boca tapada, al lado de Justin Bieber y Kanye West, en una de las surrealistas misas musicales que el controvertido rapero ofrece trimestralmente.

Marilyn Manson é acusado de ameaçar filho de 8 anos de Evan Rachel Wood,"Marilyn Manson é acusado de ameaçar filho de 8 anos de Evan Rachel Wood
Cantor foi denunciado pela atriz e outras por agressão física e sexual
Marilyn Manson e Evan Rachel Woods se relacionaram em meados de 2007 e ficaram noivos em 2010, mas romperam meses depois
A atriz Evan Rachel Wood, da série ""Westworld"", alega, em documentos judiciais, que seu ex-namorado Marilyn Manson ameaçou seu filho de oito anos. A declaração foi feita nos documentos relacionados a uma disputa judicial pela guarda da criança, fruto do relacionamento de Wood com o ator Jamie Bell.
Em fevereiro, Evan afirmou ter sofrido uma série de abusos durante seu relacionamento com Manson. Após a denúncia, outras mulheres compartilharam as próprias experiências negativas com o roqueiro, que agora é alvo de processos por estupro, tortura, violência sexual, aprisionamento ilegal, e tráfico sexual.
Segundo o jornal britânico Daily Mail, Evan Rachel Wood afirmou em abril em papéis judiciais que o músico ameaçou ""ferrar"" com seu filho, Jack, além de ameaçá-la de morte e afirmar que iria ""destruir"" as famílias das outras mulheres que o acusam. A atriz afirma ter instalado vidros à prova de balas, uma porta de metal e uma cerca de segurança em sua casa após as ameaças.
No começo do ano, ela saiu da cidade de Los Angeles com o filho para morar em Nashville, no estado do Tennessee, por conta de sua ""preocupação com a segurança"" da criança. ""Eu tenho medo extremo do suposto abusador"", diz. ""Eu sofri traumas e danos físicos e emocionais severos nas mãos dele, e tenho medo que ele busque vingança contra mim por depor machucando a mim, meu filho, e membros da minha família"".
Wood afirma ter ouvido de outra das supostas vítimas que Manson teria fotos de seus filhos, além de seus registros sociais. Ele teria dito à mulher, cuja identidade não foi revelada, que sabe onde suas famílias moram, onde as crianças estudam, onde elas e seus pais trabalham, e que ""eles estão fodidos, e vão ser destruídos"".
A disputa judicial entre Evan Rachel Wood e o ex-marido está relacionada à mudança da atriz para Nashville. Jamie Bell a acusa de querer afastá-lo de seu filho.
""Eu não entendo o que está acontecendo"", afirmou o ator, ao tribunal, segundo o Daily Mail. ""Ou as alegações de que Evan está recebendo 'ameaças de morte' são verdadeiras e Jack não está seguro com ela, ou não são verdadeiras e ela está separando nosso filho de mim por outras razões inventadas por ela"".
A sequência de acusações a Marilyn Manson começou com texto publicado por Evan em suas redes sociais. Ela afirma que era adolescente quando conheceu o cantor, e diz ter sido ""abusada e manipulada"" por ele durante anos.
Manson negou todas as acusações em seu Instagram, chamando-as de ""distorções horrorosas da realidade"".",2021-12-07T22:10:14Z,https://www.otempo.com.br,O Tempo
Bedrohte er sie und ihren Sohn?: Wood zog aus Angst vor Manson um,"Bis 2011 sind Marilyn Manson und Evan Rachel Wood ein Paar. Erst zehn Jahre später kommt heraus, dass der Musiker sie missbraucht haben soll. Aus Angst, er könne ihr und ihrem Sohn etwas antun, soll die Schauspielerin später sogar Los Angeles verlassen haben, wie jetzt bekannt wird.
2007 haben sich Evan Rachel Wood und Marilyn Manson kennengelernt, damals war sie 18, er 36 Jahre alt. Die zwei verlobten sich sogar, ehe 2011 die Trennung folgte. Im Februar des vergangenen Jahres machte die Schauspielerin dann öffentlich, sie sei während der Beziehung von dem Musiker emotional und sexuell missbraucht worden. Weitere Ex-Partnerinnen Mansons meldeten sich daraufhin mit ähnlichen Vorwürfen zu Wort. Nun werden weitere hässliche Details bekannt.
Derzeit streitet sich Evan Rachel Wood mit ihrem Ex-Mann Jamie Bell um das Sorgerecht für den gemeinsamen Sohn Jack. Wie aus Akten hervorgeht, die der britischen ""Daily Mail"" vorliegen, soll Wood wegen Marilyn Manson große Angst um den heute achtjährigen Jungen gehabt haben. Das sei schließlich auch der Grund dafür gewesen, dass sie Los Angeles den Rücken gekehrt und nach Nashville gezogen sei. Ihr Ex Bell wirft ihr vor, das getan zu haben, um ihm den Sohn zu entziehen.
""Extreme Angst"" vor Manson
Beim Prozess im März gab die 34-Jährige folgendes Statement ab: ""Ich hatte erfahren, dass Manson in Sexsklaverei und Menschenhandel von Minderjährigen involviert sein soll. Diese neuen Erkenntnisse und die laufenden kriminellen Ermittlungen gegen ihn haben mich noch mehr um die Sicherheit unseres Kindes fürchten lassen."" In der Vergangenheit habe Manson mehr als deutlich gemacht, dass er das Leben der jungen Mutter ruinieren werde, wenn sie gegen ihn aussagen würde. ""Ich fürchte mich davor, dass er sich an mir, meinem Sohn und Mitgliedern meiner Familie rächen könnte"", so Wood. Sie leide unter extremer Angst vor Manson. ""Er erschlich sich mein Vertrauen, als ich ein Teenager war und missbrauchte mich über Jahre grauenhaft. Ich bekam eine Gehirnwäsche und wurde zur Unterwerfung manipuliert.""
Auch andere Frauen, darunter die Schauspielerin Esmé Bianco, erheben seit Monaten schwere Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen den 52-jährigen Musiker. Nachdem Bianco Klage gegen ihn eingereicht hatte, schilderte kürzlich auch Ashley Morgan Smithline im Interview mit dem US-Magazin ""People"", wie Manson sie über zwei Jahre hinweg missbraucht habe. ""Ich habe ein Monster überlebt"", so die 36-Jährige.
Der Schockrocker soll Smithline unter anderem gebissen, ausgepeitscht und mit einem Messer verletzt haben. Mehrfach soll er sexuell übergriffig geworden sein. Außerdem habe er sie manchmal in einem schallisolierten Raum eingesperrt, so Smithline. Diese Aussage sorgte dafür, dass Ende November das Haus von Manson von der Polizei durchsucht wurde.",2021-12-07T20:13:27Z,https://www.n-tv.de,n-tv NACHRICHTEN
Evan Rachel Wood Claimed Marilyn Manson Threatened Her Son,"Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos by Shutterstock
More (alleged) awful, creepy shit about (alleged) awful, creepy shit Marilyn Manson has emerged, this time from March 2021 court documents for Evan Rachel Wood and her ex-partner Jamie Bell’s custody battle over their son. According to a December 6 report by The Daily Mail, Wood made a declaration in court that her ex Marilyn Manson threatened to “fuck” her now 8-year-old son. In response, Wood heightened security on her Los Angeles home and moved full-time with her son to their home in Tennessee. “I have suffered severe traumatic physical and emotional injury at his hands, and I am afraid he will seek retribution against me for testifying by harming me, our son, and members of my family,” Wood stated. “In my experience, the alleged offender is very retaliatory and has always made it clear that he will ruin my life.” Wood named Manson (legally Brian Warner) as the man who had “horrifically abused” her, beginning when she was a teen, in an Instagram post in February. Since then, she says she has received threats from both “the alleged offender and his network of fanatics.”
Manson is under federal investigation for sexual-abuse and human-trafficking allegations made by several women, including Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco. Wood claimed she isn’t the only victim whose children Manson has threatened. According to the court declaration, another unidentified victim recorded Manson saying he has photos of her children and “they’re going to be fucking destroyed.”
An attorney for Manson declined to comment to “Page Six.” Representatives for Wood and Bell did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bell filed a court motion in response, stating that “Evan’s story defies credibility” and how, as “an actor myself, I am no stranger to threats, and many people I know who are public figures have had to take security precautions.” In other words, Bell went on record saying he doesn’t believe victims.

Evan Rachel Wood diz que Marilyn Manson ameaçou seu filho de 8 anos,"Depois de processar Marilyn Manson por abuso sexual, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood conta que o cantor ameaçou ""fod**"" seu filho de oito anos, segundo documentos judiciais obtidos pelo Daily Mail. A alegação foi feita em uma declaração registrada em abril como parte da batalha em curso pela custódia da atriz com o ex-marido, Jamie Ball.
Diante da ameaça, os documentos demonstram que Woods precisou reforçar a segurança da sua casa, incluindo instação de janelas com vidros à prova de bala, uma porta de aço e cerca. Depois disso, a atriz e o filho se mudaram de Los Angeles para Nashville. “Estou muito preocupada com a segurança de nosso filho quando estiver em Los Angeles”, disse a artista segundo consta nos documentos.
“Tenho muito medo do suposto infrator”, continuou, referindo-se a Manson. “Sofri ferimentos físicos e emocionais graves e traumáticos em suas mãos e temo que ele busque retaliação contra mim por testemunhar, prejudicando a mim, meu filho e membros de minha família”. Os documentos também trazem outras afirmações da atriz. Em uma delas, uma outra vítima de Manson gravou o músico dizendo que ele havia tirado foto do filho de Evan, além de obter o número do seguro social do menino.
Entenda o caso - Marilyn Manson e Evan Rachel Wood namoraram de 2006 a 2010. Em fevereiro ela deu o nome do cantor como o agressor de quem ela falava anonimamente há anos. “Ele começou a me preparar quando eu era adolescente e abusou terrivelmente de mim durante anos”, contou em uma entrevista à Vanity Fair. “Eu fui submetida a uma lavagem cerebral e manipulada até a submissão. Estou cansada de viver com medo de retaliação, calúnia ou chantagem.""

5/6 Aus Angst vor Marilyn Manson ist Wood umgezogen.
6/6 Der Kindsvater ihres Sohnes, Schauspieler Jamie Bell, zeigt für den Umzug von Evan Rachel Wood nur wenig Verständnis. Deshalb kommt es momentan zu einem Sorgerechtsstreit.
Die Vorwürfe gegen Rocker Marilyn Manson (52) wiegen schwer: Es muss sich wegen sexuellem Missbrauch, Kidnapping und psychisches Folter verantworten. Seine Ex-Freundin, US-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (34), macht nun eine weiter schockierende Geschichte öffentlich. In einer eidesstattlichen Erklärung, die «Daily Mail» vorliegt, gibt sie einen Schock-Moment wieder. Er habe ihr gesagt: «Er wird meinen achtjährigen Sohn fi**** – eine Drohung, die ich ernst genommen habe.»
Diese Aussagen von Woods stammen aus ihrem Sorgerechtsstreit mit ihren Ex-Lebensgefährten Jamie Bell (35). Dieser hatte im März vor Gericht behauptet, dass Wood von Los Angeles nach Nashville gezogen war, um ihm den gemeinsamen Sohn Jack (8) vorzuenthalten. Sie konterte, dass der wahre Grund für den Umzug ihre Angst vor ihrem Ex-Freund Manson war: «Ich hatte erfahren, dass Manson in sexuelle Ausbeutung und Menschenhandel von Minderjährigen involviert sein soll. Diese neuen Erkenntnisse und die laufenden kriminellen Ermittlungen gegen ihn haben mich noch mehr um die Sicherheit unseres Kindes fürchten lassen.»
Deshalb wollte sie sich und ihren Sohn mit dem Umzug schützen. «Ich leide unter extremer Angst vor ihm. Er hat mir traumatischen körperlichen und seelischen Schaden zugefügt. Ich fürchte mich davor, dass er sich an mir, meinem Sohn und Mitgliedern meiner Familie rächen könnte, wenn ich gegen ihn aussage. Er hat in der Vergangenheit mir immer sehr klargemacht, dass er mein Leben ruinieren wird.»
Er erpresste seine Opfer
Wood behauptet, dass ein anderes Opfer Manson heimlich aufgenommen hätte: «Er drohte ihr, dass er Fotos ihrer Kinder habe und auch deren Versicherungsnummern. Er sagte: ‹Ich habe alles, sie sind total ausgeliefert. Ich werde sie verdammt nochmal zerstören!›»
Weil sie die Erste war, die mit den Missbrauchsvorwürfen an die Öffentlichkeit ging, wird Wood von den Fans des Musikers mit dem Leben bedroht. Sie legte dem Gericht als Beweis Onlinenachrichten vor. Eine lautete: «Wenn du mir Manson nimmst, dann nehme ich dein Leben!». Ein anderer Fan des Schock-Rockers schrieb: «Ich bin verrückt genug, um zu dir zu kommen und dich eigenhändig umzubringen!». Wood nimmt diese Worte sehr ernst und erklärt: «Die Gefahr droht nicht vom mutmasslichen Täter allein, sondern auch durch seine fanatische Fangemeinde, zu der auch Satanisten, Päderasten und Nazis gehören.»
Wood nennt ihn «Nazi»
Sie bezeichnet Manson als Nazi, weil dieser «jüdische Frauen als Opfer gewählt und mit Waffen aus alten Nazibeständen» gequält habe. Sie geht mit ihren Vorwürfen noch einen Schritt weiter: «Er hat mit Hilfe seiner Gefolgschaft Menschen gekidnappt, missbraucht und ritualistisch gefoltert – unter anderem in dem er sie gefesselt, ausgepeitscht, geschnitten, vergewaltigt und gezwungen hat, Blut zu trinken.»
Beim Sorgerechtsstreit zeigt Jamie Bell nur wenig Mitgefühl für die Situation seiner Ex-Freundin. Er meint gar: «Wenn ihre Behauptungen wahr sind und sie wirklich Todesdrohungen erhält, dann ist unser Sohn nicht bei ihr sicher».
Wood und Bell waren zum ersten Mal 2005 ein Paar, ehe Wood ihn für Manson verliess. 2011 ging sie wieder zu Bell zurück. Ihr gemeinsamer Sohn Jack kam zwei Jahre später zu Welt. Die Beziehung zerbrach 2019.

Evan Rachel Wood Claims Marilyn Manson Threatened To Sexually Assault Her Son: Report,"From 2006 to 2010, actress Evan Rachel Wood dated Marilyn Manson. The rock star has been at the receiving end of allegations pertaining to sexual assault, and earlier this year, Wood added her name to the list when she publicly accused him of abusing her. She is one of several women who have spoken out again Manson, but he has denied all allegations against him as he faces investigations.
According to the Daily Mail and Page Six, Wood is in a custody battle with her ex-husband Jamie Bell over their eight-year-old son, Jack. The outlets have stated the court documents show Wood mentioning Manson, alleging that the singer threatened ""to f*ck"" her son, and in turn, Wood increased security at her residence.

Wood claims that not only did she move from Los Angeles to Nashville where her ex-husband lives, but she also installed ""bulletproof glass windows, a steel door and fence.""
“[I’m] very concerned about our child’s safety when in Los Angeles,” she reportedly wrote in the documents. “I am extremely afraid of the alleged offender... I have suffered severe, traumatic physical and emotional injury at his hands, and I am afraid he will seek retribution against me for testifying by harming me, our son, and members of my family.”
She also wrote that a person who has also accused Manson of misconduct claimed to have recorded the singer saying ""he had taken pictures of her children and even obtained the adolescents’ social security numbers."" Meanwhile, Bell just wants to get on with their custody case.
“I frankly do not understand what is happening,” he reportedly stated in a motion. “Either Evan’s claims that she is receiving ‘death threats’ are true and Jack is not safe in her care, or they are not true and she is withholding our son from me for other reasons of her own invention.”

Evan Rachel Wood claims Marilyn Manson threatened ‘to f**k’ her son,"Actress Evan Rachel Wood claims her allegedly abusive ex Marilyn Manson made a truly stomach-churning threat about her young son.
Evan Rachel Wood claims her allegedly abusive ex Marilyn Manson threatened “to f**k” her 8-year-old son, Jack, according to court documents.
The Daily Mail reports that the allegation was made in a declaration filed in April as part of the actress’ ongoing custody battle with ex-husband Jamie Bell.
The docs state that Manson’s alleged threats forced Wood, 34, to beef up security at her home – including the installation of bulletproof glass windows, a steel door and fence – and to relocate from Los Angeles (where Bell still resides) to Nashville.
“[I’m] very concerned about our child’s safety when in Los Angeles,” the Westworld star said of her and Bell’s son in the docs, per Daily Mail.
She further alleged, “I am extremely afraid of the alleged offender,” referring to Manson, 52, whom she dated from 2006 until 2010.

“I have suffered severe, traumatic physical and emotional injury at his hands, and I am afraid he will seek retribution against me for testifying by harming me, our son, and members of my family.”
Manson is currently under investigation over claims of sexual abuse and human trafficking after more than a dozen women — including Wood — accused him of misconduct.
Wood also claimed in the docs that another alleged victim of Manson’s recorded the musician saying that he had taken pictures of her children and even obtained the adolescents’ social security numbers.
According to Daily Mail, Bell, 35, filed a motion in response, claiming Wood’s allegations “[defy] credibility.”
“I frankly do not understand what is happening,” he said. “Either Evan’s claims that she is receiving ‘death threats’ are true and Jack is not safe in her care, or they are not true and she is withholding our son from me for other reasons of her own invention.”

Representatives for Wood, Manson and Bell did not immediately respond to Page Six’s request for comment.
Bell and Wood finalised their divorce in 2014. The British actor wed Kate Mara in 2017.
Wood named Manson as her alleged abuser in February after claiming for years that she had been abused by an unnamed ex.
“He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” she alleged in an interview with Vanity Fair. “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.”
Manson has vehemently denied all the allegations, calling them “horrible distortions of reality.”
“My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners,” he wrote on Instagram in February. “Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”

Premios Grammy: se eliminó la nominación de Marilyn Manson a mejor canción de rap,"La noticia de que Marilyn Manson ha sido despojado de su nominación al Grammy 2022 por mejor canción de rap ha causado impacto en los cibernautas. Esta ‘descalificación’ se debería a la eliminación de los registros por contribución en ‘Donda’, el último álbum de Kanye West.
Previamente, el CEO de la ceremonia había defendido su postulación al argumentar que la premiación se concentraba en el talento de los que más destacan en la industria musical.
Marilyn Manson ya no será parte de los Premios Grammy 2022
Una fuente confirmó para el portal EW que Manson no escribió la canción por la que fue nominado y, por lo tanto, fue eliminado de la lista de nominaciones a los Grammy después de que se anunciara el 23 de noviembre.
Durante el martes 30 de noviembre, la Academia de la Grabación actualizó su lista de nominaciones para 2022, justo antes de anunciar la eliminación de Manson.
Según las notas de la canción en Spotify, Manson, quien proporcionó voces destacadas para la melodía, no recibe los créditos de compositor de la canción con su nombre artístico o su nombre real. Cabe señalar que, Spotify enumera a otros 11 contribuyentes a la letra de la canción, incluidos West y Jay-Z.
Manson lleva una investigación de agresión sexual en curso, a cargo del Departamento del Sheriff del Condado de Los Ángeles. El músico fue acusado de agresión sexual y abuso físico por más de 15 mujeres, incluida la actriz y su expareja Evan Rachel Wood .
CEO de los Premios Grammy defendió la nominación de Marilyn Manson pese a denuncias de abuso
Antes del anuncio definitivo de la Academia, el jefe de los Premios Grammy, Harvey Mason, ha dado su opinión sobre la nominación de Marilyn Manson en una de las categorías del evento a realizarse en el 2022. Según el encargado, el reconocimiento a los artistas de la industria está por encima de cualquier “antecedente” que estos puedan tener.
Cuando el portal The Wrap le preguntó acerca de la nominación de Manson en la próxima edición de los Grammys, Mason señaló que los encargados de los premios no tienen ninguna regla o límite para que cualquier persona envíe su material “para su consideración”.
“No miraremos hacia atrás en la historia de las personas, no miraremos sus antecedentes penales, no veremos nada más que la legalidad dentro de nuestras reglas. ¿Esta grabación para este trabajo es elegible según la fecha y otros criterios?”, indicó.",2021-12-05T02:37:26Z,https://larepublica.pe,LaRepública.pe
Grammys pull one of Marilyn Manson's nomination following backlash,"Manson’s nomination for Kanye West’s song 'Jail' was removed by the Recording Academy earlier this week
Shock rocker Marilyn Manson has lost out on one of his two nominations at the 64th Grammy Awards following online backlash against him being nominated, reported The Hollywood Reporter.
Brian Hugh Warner’s nomination for his work on Kanye West’s song Jail, which is nominated in the best rap song category, was removed in an updated list of nominees shared by the Recording Academy earlier this week.
While the reason of his removal was not explicitly cited, a source close to THR termed it “a procedural update as Manson is not a writer on the song he was previously nominated for.”
His nomination as a featured artist and a songwriter on Kanye West’s Donda in Album of the Year category still stands.

"Marilyn Manson tinha duas nomeações aos Grammys, agora só tem uma","O artista, que está a ser investigado por abuso e violência sexual, perdeu o crédito na nomeação na categoria de Melhor Canção Rap por Jail Pt. 2 , de Kanye West e Jay-Z, mas continua nomeado na categoria de Melhor Álbum do Ano, pela sua colaboração em Donda , de Kanye West.
O artista Marilyn Manson, que está a ser investigado em Los Angeles por abusos e violência sexual, viu ser removida uma das suas duas nomeações para a 64.ª edição dos Prémios Grammy, cuja lista de nomeados tinha sido anunciada na semana passada. A cerimónia de atribuição dos prémios está marcada para o dia 31 de Janeiro do próximo ano.
Marilyn Manson, cujo verdadeiro nome é Brian Hugh Warner, estava nomeado na categoria de Melhor Canção de Rap, pela sua colaboração com Kanye West e Jay- Z na música Jail Pt. 2. No site dos Prémios Grammy, sem outra explicação, lê-se: “O compositor Marilyn Manson (também conhecido como Brian Hugh Warner) foi removido”. Mas, nas nomeações, o seu nome ainda aparece no álbum Donda, de Kanye West, na categoria de candidatos ao Melhor Álbum do Ano.
A Entertainment Weekly, citando fontes anónimas, assegura que Brian Hugh Warner não escreveu a canção pela qual estava nomeado e por isso foi retirado da lista que tinha sido anunciada no dia 23 de Novembro. No Spotify, faz notar a Entertainment Weekly, o seu nome também não aparece nos créditos como um dos autores da música.
Nessa mesma página, explicam que todos os anos a Recording Academy, depois de anunciar as nomeações para os prémios Grammy, faz rectificações à primeira lista apresentada. Este ano, escrevem, pela primeira vez estão a tornar públicas essas actualizações para garantir que há em todo o processo “transparência e acesso às informações”.
Conta o jornal New York Times que dias depois do anúncio das nomeações dos Grammys houve interrogações sobre as nomeações, não só de Manson mas também do humorista Louis C.K, que em 2017 pediu desculpa pela sua conduta sexual imprópria, nomeado por Sincerely Louis CK , candidato a Álbum Cómico do Ano.
Numa entrevista ao The Wrap, Harvey Mason Jr., presidente executivo da Recording Academy, veio dizer que as nomeações se baseiam apenas na qualidade das gravações que são enviadas para o prémio e não no comportamento dos artistas: “Não olhamos para a história das pessoas, nem para os seus antecedentes criminais, não olhamos para nada além do que é válido dentro das nossas regras; de as gravações serem elegíveis para nomeação com base na data e em outros critérios”.
Além de outras alterações como a inclusão de nomes que faltavam nos créditos ou correcção de erros de ortografia foi também acrescentada à lista a compositora Linda Chorney, na categoria de Melhor Canção com Raízes Norte-Americanas, com a canção Bored.",2021-12-04T14:57:39Z,https://www.publico.pt,PÚBLICO

Marilyn Manson é acusado de ameaçar o filho da atriz Evan Rachel Wood - (crédito: Reprodução)
A atriz Evan Rachel Wood acusou o cantor Marilyn Manson de ameaçar o seu filho Jack, de 8 anos de idade. O músico e a atriz se relacionaram por volta de 2006 a 2010. Temendo a segurança da criança, Rachel Wood teria instalado janelas de vidro à prova de balas, porta de aço e cerca, até se mudar para a cidade de Nashville.
A alegação foi registrada em abril durante a batalha judicial entre a atriz e seu ex-marido, o ator Jamie Bell, pela custódia do filho, segundo informações obtidas pelo jornal britânico The Daily Mail.
Mason é centro de polêmicas, foi acusado de abuso sexual e outros comportamentos violentos de até 15 vítimas, incluindo Evan. Documentos judiciais mostram que a atriz também afirmou que o cantor teria ameaçado seu filho, Jack.
“Sofri ferimentos físicos e emocionais graves e traumáticos em suas mãos e temo que ele busque retaliação contra mim por testemunhar, prejudicando a mim, meu filho e membros de minha família'', afirmou Wood.
Em fevereiro, a atriz mencionou pela primeira vez o nome do cantor que manteve um longo relacionamento, como sendo causador de abusos que já havia relatado em uma audiência na Justiça, no início de 2018, na época as acusações foram arquivadas por falta de provas. Ela afirma que o cantor a ""manipulou psicologicamente"" e que foi submetida ""a horríveis abusos durante anos"".",2021-12-04T03:00:00Z,https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br,Correio Braziliense
Marylin Manson fratatt Grammy-nominasjon: Dette skal være årsaken,"Marilyn Manson var nominert til beste rap-låt sammen med Kanye West og Jay-Z for «Donda»-singelen «Jail».
I denne saken finner du noen av de mest aktuelle kjendis-snakkisene fra inn- og utland akkurat nå.
I november ble Grammy-nominasjonene endelig sluppet, og blant de nominerte på lista var Marilyn Manson (52). Torsdag ble imidlertid en oppdatert liste lagt ut, der flere nominasjoner var trukket.
Manson var nominert i kategorien «årets rap-låt» ved siden av Kanye West og Jay-Z, og de tre artistene var nominert for singelen «Jail» – som er en del av det mye omtalte og nyeste albumet til West.
Ukjent årsak
Manson var i utgangspunktet nominert i to kategorier, og det er bare en av nominasjonene som er trukket. Grunnen til at Manson, eller Brian Hugh Warner som er hans ekte navn, ble trukket var ikke begrunnet på lista.
The Hollywood Reporter har imidlertid fått opplyst fra en kilde at grunnen skal ha vært at han ikke har vært med på å skrive låten han tidligere var nominert for.
I tillegg til å ha vært nominert som låtskriver under årets rap-kategori, er rockestjerna med flere seksuelle trakasseringssiktelser på seg fortsatt nominert som feature-artist under kategorien «årets album» sammen med en rekke andre artister.
Rockestjerna er under etterforskning av myndighetene etter at en rekke kvinner har beskyldt han for seksuell trakassering, hvor noen forteller de skal ha blitt låst inne i lydtette rom.
Mansons tidligere forlovede og «Westworld»-skuespiller Evan Rachel Wood (34) skal også ha identifisert ham som en misbruker i et Instagram-innlegg i februar.

Manson har vært en del av musikk-scenen siden 90-tallet, og har hittil mottatt fire Grammy-nominasjoner. Han har derimot aldri vunnet.
Svarer på gravidryktene
Nok en gang har rykter om en mulig graviditet florert rundt den populære artisten Rihanna (33), som nylig ble sammen med New York-rapperen ASAP Rocky (33).
Rapperen bekreftet forholdet tidligere i mai i et intervju med GQ, hvor han beskrev henne som «sitt livs kjærlighet».
Ryktene ble satt i gang etter at artisten nylig var i hjemlandet Barbados, der hun ble titulert som en nasjonalhelt. Hun er den ellevte personen som blir utnevnt nasjonalhelt på Barbados.
Kunngjøringen skjedde i forbindelse med at Barbados markerer slutten på sitt bånd med Storbritannia, som koloniserte landet for 396 år siden. Hun mottok æren fra statsminister Mia Mottley, med Prins Charles til stede.
Et bilde av popsangeren skal ha vært grunnet til at ryktene ble spredd som ild i tørt gress, da artisten poserer med hendene på magen.

Selv har derimot Rihanna gått ut på Instagram for å avkrefte ryktene. Det gjør hun i en påstått direktemelding-utveksling med en fan på Instagram.
«Kan jeg komme i babyshoweren din? Enten det er sant eller ikke kommer babyene dine til å bli vakre», lød meldingen sangeren fikk i innboksen.
«Ha, slutt! Du kom ikke i de første 10. Dere avler meg hvert år, lol», svarer Rihanna, og avkrefter tilsynelatende ryktene.

Skuespiller og stand-up komiker Aziz Ansari (38) og den danske kjæresten Serena Skov Campbell har forlovet seg.

Marilyn Manson Dropped From Best Rap Song Grammy Nomination For Kanye West’s “Jail”,"Marilyn Manson has been stripped of a 2022 Grammy nomination by the Recording Academy after not being listed as a songwriter for Kanye West's ""Jail"" on the most updated version of Donda. The track is up for the award of Best Rap Song.
The Academy notes that the decision was not made in response to backlash from Manson's allegations of physical abuse and trafficking leveled by actresses Esmé Bianco and Evan Rachel Wood. Manson could still take home a Grammy for his contributions to the Donda track ""Jail Pt. 2,” as the project as a whole is nominated for Album of the Year.

In response to the backlash of Manson's nomination, Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said that the artist's disturbing past does not disqualify him from consideration.
“We won’t restrict the people who can submit their material for consideration,” he said in a statement according to The Wrap. “We won’t look back at people’s history, we won’t look at their criminal record, we won’t look at anything other than the legality within our rules of, is this recording for this work eligible based on date and other criteria. If it is, they can submit for consideration.”
He continued: “What we will control is our stages, our shows, our events, our red carpets. We’ll take a look at anyone who is asking to be a part of that, asking to be in attendance, and we’ll make our decisions at that point. But we’re not going to be in the business of restricting people from submitting their work for our voters to decide on.”

Darum gehts Marilyn Manson (52) hat eine seiner zwei Grammy-Nominierungen verloren.
Das hat die Recording Academy am Donnerstag in Form einer aktualisierten Nominierten-Liste bekanntgegeben.
Der Grund ist unklar. Laut einem Insider soll die Streichung allerdings nichts mit den Vorwürfen der sexuellen Gewalt zu tun haben, die gegen ihn im Raum stehen.
Vergangene Woche wurde die Nominierungsliste für die 64. Grammy Awards veröffentlicht. Nun hat die Recording Academy, so heisst die Organisation hinter der Musikpreisverleihung, diverse Änderungen an der Liste vorgenommen. So wurden in der aktualisierten Version vom Donnerstag etwa Rechtschreibfehler korrigiert, einige Namen hinzugefügt, und andere gestrichen. Die auffälligste Änderung: Marilyn Manson (52) hat eine seiner zwei Grammy-Nominierungen verloren.
Manson, der in mehrere Prozesse wegen sexueller Übergriffe verwickelt ist, verlor seine Nominierung für den Song «Jail» von Kanye West als «Bester Rap Song». Auf dem über sechsminütigen Track ist der Grusel-Rocker jeweils im Refrain und in der Bridge zu hören. Gründe für die Streichung wurden offiziell keine genannt.
Eine Quelle des «Hollywoodreporter» behauptet jedoch zu wissen, dass es sich bei der Änderung lediglich um eine prozedurale Aktualisierung handle. Er habe den Song nämlich nicht geschrieben, sondern sei lediglich darauf zu hören, und somit irrtümlich gelistet worden.
Vorwürfe bleiben bestehen
Im Februar dieses Jahres veröffentlichte Evan Rachel Wood (34) ein Statement auf Instagram, in dem sie vor der Gefahr, die von ihrem Ex ausgehe, warnte: «Der Name des Täters ist Brian Warner, der Welt auch als Marilyn Manson bekannt. Er hat mich jahrelang auf schreckliche Weise misshandelt. Ich wurde einer Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und zur Unterwerfung manipuliert. Ich habe es satt, in Angst vor Vergeltung, Verleumdung oder Erpressung zu leben.»

Seine Kunst und sein Leben seien schon lange «Magnete für Kontroversen», aber die jüngsten Behauptungen über ihn seien «schreckliche Verfälschungen der Realität», schrieb der Musiker auf Instagram.

Marilyn Manson loses Grammy nomination,"Disgraced musician Marilyn Manson has lost one of two previously announced nominations for the 64th Grammy Awards. Manson was removed as a Grammy nominee in an updated list published by the Recording Academy on the Grammys' website on Thursday.
The reason for his removal was not cited on the list, but a source close to the situation told The Hollywood Reporter it was a procedural update as Manson is not a writer on the song he was previously nominated for. The musician, who has been embroiled in a number of sexual assault lawsuits, was nominated in the best rap song category alongside Kanye West and Jay-Z for the 'Donda' rapper's single 'Jail'.
In addition to the best rap song category, Manson received a second 'Donda' nomination alongside a list of artists for album of the year as a featured artist and a songwriter. That nomination, according to the Grammys' site, still stands. As per The Hollywood Reporter, the musician is currently being investigated by Los Angeles authorities on accusations of sexual assault made by a number of women. Most recently, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy Eva Jimenez confirmed a search warrant was served on Manson's home.
The LA sheriff's department first announced that detectives were investigating Manson over reports of domestic violence in February, relating to incidents that allegedly took place between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood. This was the same month Manson's former fiancee and 'Westworld' actor Evan Rachel Wood publicly identified him as her abuser in an Instagram post.
'Game of Thrones' actor Esme Bianco has also sued Manson in federal court. She alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse and stated that the rocker also violated human trafficking laws by bringing her to California from England for roles in music videos and movies that never materialised. Manson previously appeared alongside West and singer Justin Bieber at one of Kanye West's Sunday Service events.
Manson, who emerged on the music scene in the 90s, has previously received four Grammy nominations over the course of his career but never won. (ANI)

Academia do Grammy retira uma das indicações de Marilyn Manson,"Marilyn Manson perdeu uma das indicações ao Grammy 2022. O cantor não concorrerá mais à Melhor Canção de Rap por “Jail”, de Kanye West. Em uma atualização postada no site da premiação, foi revelado que a categoria considerará apenas os nomes de West e Jay-Z para o troféu, já que Manson não foi creditado como compositor e letrista da música.
De acordo com o THR, a retirada da indicação não está relacionada às várias acusações de abuso sexual contra Manson, que ainda tem seu nome incluído entre os artistas de Donda, álbum de West que traz “Jail” como uma de suas faixas.
Recentemente, Harvey Mason Jr., presidente da Academia, justificou a indicação a Manson afirmando que a instituição não restringirá quem pode submeter trabalhos à avaliação dos votantes do Grammy.
Manson, cujo nome real é Brian Warner, foi acusado de abuso sexual por múltiplas mulheres com quem manteve relacionamentos ao longo das últimas décadas. Ele, que nega as acusações, foi indicado duas vezes ao Grammy 2022 por colaborações com o álbum DONDA, de Kanye West. Embora Manson não seja o principal compositor, ele é considerado um indicado por conta do regulamento da premiação. Assim, ele soma seis indicações ao Grammy na carreira.
Neste ano, concorrem a álbum do ano Olivia Rodrigo, Doja Cat, Taylor Swift, Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Billie Eilish, H.E.R., Jon Batiste, Lil Nas X e Kanye West -- veja a lista completa de indicados.

Marilyn Manson Loses Grammy Nod as 2022 Nominations Are Fine-Tuned,"The Recording Academy has removed Marilyn Manson as a Grammy nominee for best rap song, but the shock rocker continues to be a nominee for album of the year for his role as a songwriter on Kanye West’s DONDA. (The removal in best rap song is unrelated to abuse allegations against Manson.)
Manson (real name: Brian Hugh Warner) had been listed as a nominee for best rap song for West’s “Jail” (featuring Jay-Z), a track from DONDA. But the Academy determined that Manson actually co-wrote “Jail pt 2,” which features vocals from Manson and rapper DaBaby. The Grammys have ruled that that is a separate song from “Jail,” the best rap song nominee, though it is still a song on the album, hence Manson’s album of the year nomination stands.
The Grammy nominations list includes thousands of names and data points. Every year, it makes tweaks and adjustments as necessary after the list is first published. These range from fixing a misspelled name to adding a producer who was overlooked. This year, it has collected those adjustments into a list, which can be found on its site.
Here are some of the most significant adjustments the Academy has made so far:
Linda Chorney’s “Bored” was added as a sixth nominee for best American roots song. The Academy determined that Chorney’s song was inadvertently left off the initial nominations list. Someone at the Academy’s accounting firm, Deloitte, flagged Chorney’s name because her first Grammy nomination 10 years ago for Emotional Jukebox as best Americana album had stirred surprise and some press attention. After Deloitte’s review proved that the current nomination was justified, someone neglected to put her back in the category. In the meantime, they had moved another candidate into that spot. Rather than remove that contender, the category will have six nominees.
Louis Bell was added in the record of the year category as a co-producer of Justin Bieber’s “Peaches” (featuring Daniel Caeser and Giveon). This is the fourth consecutive year that Bell has been nominated for record of the year. He was among the producers of nominated Post Malone hits in each of the last three years: “Rockstar” (featuring 21 Savage, 2018), “Sunflower” (a collab with Swae Lee, 2018) and “Circles” (2020).
Engineer/mixer John Hanes has been added as a nominee in both album and record of the year for his work with Lil Nas X. Hanes is nominated in album of the year for Montero and in record of the year for “Montero (Call Me by Your Name).” Hanes is a 15-time Grammy winner, including four wins for album of the year for Taylor Swift’s 1989 (2015), Adele’s 25 (2016), Bruno Mars’ 24K Magic (2017) and Swift’s folklore (2020). Hanes has also won record of the year twice, for his work on Mark Ronson featuring Mars’ “Uptown Funk!” (2015) and Mars’ “24K Magic” (2017).
The names of compilation producers and music supervisors have been added in the best compilation soundtrack for visual media category. Alex Lacamoire co-produced two of the nominated albums — Dear Evan Hansen (with Benj Pasek, Justin Paul & Dan Romer) and In the Heights (with Lin-Manuel Miranda, Bill Sherman & Greg Wells). Lacamoire is a four-time Grammy winner, including one in this category three years ago for The Greatest Showman.",2021-12-02T20:55:53Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Marilyn Manson Loses a Grammy Nomination, and a Songwriter Gains One","Chorney had been on an initial version of the ballot under best American roots song, for her “Bored.” That version of the list, which circulated outside the Recording Academy in the days before the nominations were announced on Nov. 23, also had just eight slots for the top four categories; the day before that announcement, the Grammys’ board approved increasing that number to 10, adding artists including West and Taylor Swift. When the final nominations list came out, Chorney had been replaced by another artist, though some news outlets online still included her name.
This week, the Grammys added Chorney back in. She had been removed, the academy said, because the accounting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the awards’ longtime partner in collecting and tabulating votes, had performed an “audit” on the votes she received, and the academy decided to remove her name from the ballot.
“That audit has now concluded, and Ms. Chorney’s recording has been added back in,” the academy said in a statement. “We apologize for any inconvenience this delay may have caused, but ensuring the integrity of our voting process is paramount.” It offered no explanation for how the early nominations list, which contained Chorney’s name, was released.
Why was the audit conducted? In an interview on Wednesday, Chorney said that Harvey Mason Jr., the academy’s chief executive, told her in a phone call this week that she had been “flagged” because of her previous public comments about the Grammys. In 2011, her “Emotional Jukebox” was a surprise nominee for best Americana album. She was criticized at the time for “gaming the system” — she acknowledged using the Grammys’ website to promote herself, a common and permitted tactic at the time — and said she even got death threats. She helped make a movie about the experience titled “When I Sing.”
Days after this year’s nominations were announced, the Grammys came under scrutiny for giving nominations to figures like Manson and Louis C.K., the comedian who in 2017 admitted to sexual misconduct. In a recent interview with The Wrap, Mason said that Grammy eligibility is based only on the recordings submitted for the awards, not any artist’s past behavior. “We won’t look back at people’s history,” he said.",2021-12-02T17:35:28Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times

Key Facts
Manson — whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner — is credited as one of the writers for Kanye West’s album Donda, which is up for album of the year, and as a writer for West’s song “Jail,” which is nominated for best rap song. Manson’s name has been removed under the Grammy category for best rap song on its website, however, the Recording Academy did not give a reason for the removal. Forbes has reached out to the Recording Academy for comment.
Crucial Quote
Recording Academy’s CEO Harvey Mason Jr. told The Wrap the Recording Academy will not “restrict” people from making nomination submissions, and the academy does not “look back at people’s history” or their “criminal record,” only if their submission is “eligible.”
Key Background
On Monday, L.A. County Sheriff’s Department searched Manson’s home and confiscated media devices as part of their investigation into reports of alleged sexual abuse connected to Manson. Several women Manson had previously dated, including actress Evan Rachel Wood and actress Esmé Bianco, have come forward accusing Manson of abuse and sexual assault. Manson also faces multiple lawsuits from some of the women who have accused him of abuse, including Bianco, who claimed he raped her. Manson has denied the allegations, and his lawyer has called the claims “untrue” and “meritless.”

Marilyn Manson's house searched in abuse investigation,"The home of Marilyn Manson was searched by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Special Victims Bureau on Monday, according to a press release from the bureau.
Authorities are investigating the rock musician, whose real name is Brian Warner, for alleged domestic violence and sexual assault. The alleged incidents occurred between 2009 and 2011.
Detectives served a search warrant at his West Hollywood home as part of the ongoing investigation. He was not home at the time, and items such as media storage devices were seized, according to the bureau.
The investigation remains active and there was no additional information information released.
Several women have accused Manson, 52, of sexual, physical or emotional abuse. In May, ""Game of Thrones"" actor Esmé Bianco sued Manson, alleging he violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England under the false pretenses of roles in music videos and movies that never materialized.
The suit says Bianco was expected to stay at Manson's home instead of the hotel where she had been booked, and that there was no crew, only Manson himself shooting with a phone.
Manson deprived Bianco of food and sleep though gave her alcohol and drugs, locked her in a bedroom, whipped her, gave her electric shocks, tried to force her to have sex with another woman and threatened to enter her room and rape her during the night, the suit alleges. No music video was ever released.
Manson said earlier this year that all of his intimate relationships have been entirely consensual.
In February, actress Evan Rachel Wood claimed that Manson, whom she began dating in 2007 and got engaged to in 2010, groomed and abused her during their relationship, which began when she was 19 and he was 38.
At the time, Manson denied allegations of abuse from Wood and and several other women. ""Obviously my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy,"" he wrote on Instagram on February 1. ""But these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.""
In an interview with Rolling Stone earlier this month, a former assistant of Manson's alleged he soundproofed a room where he would lock ""bad girls.""
At least 16 former partners have accused Manson of abuse and four have filed civil lawsuits, including Bianco, an anonymous ex-girlfriend, model Ashley Morgan Smithline and Manson's former employee Ashley Walters, according to CBS Los Angeles. He has repeatedly denied all allegations.
He has yet to be charged in relation to any of the allegations. Manson's legal team filed a motion to dismiss Bianco's case, but it was denied by Federal Judge Fernando L. Aenlle-Rocha in October.

The women involved were not identified, but several have publicly alleged this year that they were physically, sexually and emotionally abused by Manson, and some have filed lawsuits.

Η 33χρονη Γουντ, η οποία είχε σχέση με τον 52χρονο Manson περίπου από το 2007 και το 2010 αρραβωνιάστηκαν αλλά πολύ σύντομα χώρισαν, διατύπωσε τις κατηγορίες αυτές στον λογαριασμό της στο Instagram.
""Το όνομα αυτού που με κακοποιούσε είναι Μπράιαν Γουόρνερ, γνωστός στον κόσμο ως Marilyn Manson. Ξεκίνησε να με αποπλανά όταν ήμουν έφηβη και με κακοποιούσε φρικτά επί χρόνια. Υπέστην πλύση εγκεφάλου και με χειραγώγησε ώστε να υποταχθώ"", είχε γράψει η Γουντ.
Πολλές είναι οι γυναίκες που έχουν αναφέρει ότι τους στερούσε τον ύπνο και το φαγητό, τις βίαζε, τις δάγκωνε, τις μαστίγωνε χωρίς φυσικά τη συναίνεσή τους. Επίσης, έχουν πει ότι τις κυνηγούσε με τσεκούρι και άνοιγε τρύπες στον τοίχο.
Έχουν υπάρξει αναφορές για ένα δωμάτιο με ηχομόνωση που διατηρούσε σε διαμέρισμά του ο καλλιτέχνης, το οποίο χρησιμοποιούσε ως κελί φυλακής, για να τιμωρεί τις συντρόφους του και να τις βασανίζει.
Ανάμεσά τους και η Εσμέ Μπιάνκο, πρωταγωνίστρια του ""Game of Thrones"", που έζησε στο συγκεκριμένο σπίτι για δύο χρόνια.

Marilyn Manson - Έφοδος της αστυνομίας στο σπίτι του - Κατηγορείται για σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα,"Σε έφοδο στο σπίτι του τραγουδιστή Marilyn Manson προχώρησε η αστυνομία του Λος Άντζελες, μετά τις καταγγελίες εις βάρος του για σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα.
Σύμφωνα με το ΤΜΖ, ο τραγουδιστής ήταν απών, όταν οι ντετέκτιβ μπήκαν στο διαμέρισμά του με ένταλμα.
«Πήραν τις μονάδες αποθήκευσης πολυμέσων», αναφέρει το ίδιο ρεπορτάζ ενώ εκπρόσωπος του σερίφη του Λος Άντζελες δήλωσε πως είχε γνώση της έρευνας αλλά δεν μπορούσε να δώσει λεπτομέρειες.
Για εκτεταμένη έρευνα έκαναν λόγο πηγές της αστυνομίας και στο Rolling Stone

Σημειώνεται, ότι από την πλευρά του Marilyn Manson δεν υπάρχει προς το παρόν επίσημη τοποθέτηση, ενώ με κάθε ευκαιρία οι δικηγόροι του έχουν αρνηθεί τις κατηγορίες.
Οι καταθέσεις που συγκλονίζουν
Ο τραγουδιστής, το πραγματικό όνομα του οποίου είναι Brian Warner, κατηγορείται για σεξουαλική παρενόχληση και κακοποίηση πολλών γυναικών, ανάμεσά τους και η πρώην αρραβωνιαστικιά του, Evan Rachel Wood.
Τον Νοέμβριο, το Rolling Stone είχε δημοσιεύσει μία έρευνα εννέα μηνών βασισμένη στα κείμενα της δικογραφίας εναντίον του, σε μαρτυρίες και σε 55 συνεντεύξεις από ανθρώπους που κακοποιήθηκαν από εκείνον.
Οι γυναίκες είχαν μιλήσει για ένα διαμέρισμα – κολαστήριο, που είχε τσεκούρια, μαστίγια, σβάστικες, κομμένες φωτογραφίες από περιοδικά πορνό και ήταν γεμάτο αίμα.
Επίσης, είχε δωμάτιο με ηχομόνωση που χρησιμοποιούνταν ως κελί φυλακής. Σε αυτόν φυλακίζονταν όταν ήταν άτακτες και έπρεπε να τιμωρηθούν.
Η Ashley Morgan Smithlin, που έχει πέσει θύμα κακοποίησης από τον Manson αποκάλυψε ότι την κρατούσε δεμένη σε αυτό το δωμάτιο και καλλιεργούσε την ιδέα ότι πρόκειται για μία τιμωρία που της άξιζε.
Το υπόλοιπο διαμέρισμα του μουσικού ήταν μαύρο. Τα χαλιά, τα έπιπλα και όλη η διακόσμηση ήταν μαύρη, όπως και οι κουρτίνες. Ήθελε να υπάρχει απόλυτο σκοτάδι όλες τις ώρες της ημέρας.
Επίσης, ήθελε η θερμοκρασία να είναι πάρα πολύ χαμηλή. Αν κάποιος τολμούσε να την ανεβάσει, γινόταν έξαλλος και έσπαγε τα πάντα. Μία από τις πρώην συντρόφους του έχει χαρακτηρίσει το διαμέρισμα «μαύρο ψυγείο».
Πολλές είναι οι γυναίκες που έχουν αναφέρει ότι τους στερούσε τον ύπνο και το φαγητό, τις βίαζε, τις δάγκωνε, τις μαστίγωνε χωρίς φυσικά τη συναίνεσή τους. Επίσης, έχουν πει ότι τις κυνηγούσε με τσεκούρι και άνοιγε τρύπες στον τοίχο.
Τα παραπάνω έχει επιβεβαιώσει και η Esme Bianco, η γνωστή ηθοποιός του Game of Thrones, που έζησε στο συγκεκριμένο σπίτι για δύο χρόνια.",2021-12-01T08:09:29Z,https://www.in.gr,In.gr
"La policía busca pruebas en la casa de Marilyn Manson, acusado de abuso sexual y violencia doméstica","Marilyn Manson, en la fiesta del Oscar organizada por la revista 'Vanity Fair' en febrero pasado. DANNY MOLOSHOK (Reuters)
La policía de Los Ángeles entró la mañana del lunes a la casa de Marilyn Manson en busca de pruebas en el caso que se sigue contra el músico por abuso sexual y violencia doméstica. Las autoridades cumplieron con una orden de cateo para ingresar a la residencia del artista, en la zona de Hollywood. Manson, cuyo nombre real es Brian Warner, no se encontraba en el lugar, han informado este martes integrantes de la oficina del sheriff del condado. Tras la revisión, las autoridades abandonaron la propiedad con discos duros, ha informado la agencia Associated Press.
Más información La policía emite una orden de arresto contra Marilyn Manson
Manson, de 52 años, es investigado desde mediados de febrero de este año, cuando se hizo público que una mujer, que se ha mantenido en el anonimato hasta el momento, lo acusó de abuso sexual y violencia doméstica. Estos incidentes sucedieron supuestamente entre 2009 y 2011 en el apartamento del artista en la zona de West Hollywood, una propiedad distinta a la que fue rastreada la mañana de ayer. La oficina especializada en atención a víctimas del departamento de sheriff de Los Ángeles lleva meses investigando el caso, solo uno entre los cuatro que enfrenta el artista.
Esta acusación fue precedida por el testimonio público de Evan Rachel Wood, quien fue novia desde 2007 y hasta 2010 del intérprete de The Beautiful People. Ella tenía 19 años y él 38. Wood dijo, también en febrero, en una publicación de Instagram que había sido víctima de una relación abusiva en la que le “lavaron el cerebro y manipularon hasta la sumisión”. “Se acabó el miedo a la venganza, a la calumnia o al chantaje. Esto es para exponer a este peligroso hombre y hacer un llamamiento a las muchas industrias que lo han acogido, antes de que arruine más vidas”, escribió la protagonista de Westworld, la serie de HBO. Después del mensaje, Loma Vista Recordings, la disquera de Manson informó en un comunicado que terminaban la relación laboral con el músico y que dejaría de promover su obra. Manson calificó las palabras de su ex como una “horrible distorsión de la realidad”. También ha negado, a través de abogados, otras acusaciones.
La actriz Esmé Bianco, quien fue Ros en Juego de Tronos, acudió en abril a un tribunal federal para presentar una denuncia en contra de Warner, a quien acusó de abuso sexual, físico y emocional por traerla en 2009 desde Inglaterra, de donde es originaria, a Estados Unidos para protagonizar el vídeo musical de I Want To Kill You Like They Do in the Movies, un tema del disco High End Low. La promesa fue falsa, clama Bianco, quien asegura haber sido encerrada en una habitación durante cuatro días donde fue golpeada con un látigo y recibió descargas eléctricas.
La demanda aclara que después de esto ambos iniciaron una relación a distancia entre ambos. En 2011, Manson invitó nuevamente al país a Bianco para protagonizar Phantasmagoria, una cinta que iba a dirigir y que no se concretó. La actriz asegura que en esa visita el músico la cortó con un cuchillo nazi que forma parte de la colección de objetos de la Segunda Guerra Mundial de Warner. También la persiguió por el apartamento con un hacha. “Tomó varios años a la señora Bianco entender hasta qué punto había sido víctima del abuso físico, psicológico, sexual y emocional del señor Warner. Su carrera sufrió por el deterioro de su salud mental”, informa el texto.

El abogado de Manson, Howard King, aseguró que probarán en los tribunales que este testimonio es falso. “Esta demanda fue presentada solamente porque mi cliente se negó a ceder ante Bianco y su abogado, quienes reclamaban un escandaloso monto basándose en hechos que nunca ocurrieron”.
Ashley Morgan Smithline es otra de las denunciantes. La modelo asegura en una entrevista con el diario Los Angeles Times que fue traída desde Tailandia con la promesa de interpretar otro papel para Manson. El músico, dice, la ató y penetró sin su consentimiento. En otra ocasión la cortó con un cuchillo en el hombro y dibujó las letras MM en uno de sus muslos. Esta narrativa también ha sido disputada públicamente por Warner en junio, quien aseguró que la relación con Smithline duró menos de una semana en 2010 y que los dichos contienen “tantas falsedades que no sabría por dónde comenzar”.
Un juez decidió en mayo de este año desechar una de las demandas en contra de Manson por considerar que el supuesto delito, cometido en 2011, había prescrito. La mayoría de señalamientos contra el músico datan del periodo entre 2009 y 2011, lo que ha servido a los abogados del músico para afirmar que todo se debe a un plan orquestado de ataque en contra de su cliente.
Warner, originario del Estado de Ohio, irrumpió en el mundo de la música a mediados de los años 90 con Portrait of an American Family. Su personaje fue fabricado para escandalizar, pero se convirtió en una figura atractiva para una audiencia que lo consideró un reclamo de expresión que chocaba violentamente con el conservadurismo de la época. La gran fama le llegó en 1996 con su disco Antichrist Superstar y posteriormente con Mechanical Animals, que lo convirtió en un fenómeno en todo el mundo.
Estas acusaciones refuerzan algo que siempre ha sido difícil de distinguir, los límites entre Brian Warner y su personaje, que suele describir en sus canciones violentas imágenes contra las mujeres. En The Long Hard Road Out of Hell, su memoria publicada en 1998 junto al periodista Neil Strauss, el artista afirmó haber escupido e intentando ahorcar a su madre cuando era adolescente. También describió cómo cubrió de carne a una fan sorda para orinarle encima en un estudio de grabación. Ese mismo año, el director de la revista Spin lo demandó después de que los guardaespaldas del artista lo golpearan. Manson estaba molesto de que no le habían ofrecido la portada de un número que estaba por publicarse. El periodista y Warner llegaron a un acuerdo económico y evitaron un juicio. Ahora serán las cortes las que deberán arrojar algo de luz a la leyenda de Marilyn Manson.

Marilyn Manson obsessive found guilty of killing ex,"A Massachusetts woman who blamed her obsession with animal corpses and death on Marilyn Manson has been found guilty of murdering her ex-boyfriend in a treehouse.
Julia Enright, 24, was convicted by a jury on Monday of second-degree murder in the 2018 fatal stabbing of 20-year-old Brandon Chicklis.
Prosecutors said Enright had lured Chicklis to a treehouse near her home with the intent to kill him as a “gift” for her new boyfriend.
Enright testified during her trial that she stabbed Chicklis in self-defense as he raped her — and insisted she never meant to kill him.
Under cross-examination, prosecutors asked Enright to read several of her journal entries, including one where she wrote: “I just have an insatiable curiosity to kill a person.”
She had also referenced grave-robbing and collecting animal bones and organs, according to CBS4.

Enright argued that her interests were based on a fixation she had at the time with the singer Marilyn Manson.
After the killing, Enright testified that she called her boyfriend as she fled the treehouse.
She said he helped her dispose of Chicklis’ body a few miles away off the side of a highway in Rindge, New Hampshire, where it was found by a jogger 17 days later.
Her boyfriend hasn’t been charged.
Enright is now facing a mandatory sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 15 years at her sentencing hearing on Jan. 18.

Die Durchsuchung hängt mit Vorwürfen der sexuellen Nötigung zusammen, die gegen Manson erhoben wurden. Insgesamt 15 Frauen, darunter auch Ex-Freundin Evan Rachel Wood (34), beschuldigen den Sänger, sie körperlich, sexuell und psychisch missbraucht zu haben.

Polícia cumpre mandado em casa de Marilyn Manson,"Reprodução/Instagram
Na manhã da última segunda feira, dia 29 de novembro, Marilyn Manson recebeu a visita de policiais em sua casa. As autoridades cumpriram um mandado de busca e apreensão em sua casa no bairro de Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. A ação aconteceu após diversas mulheres acusarem o cantor de abuso sexual e psicológico. O artista não estava na residência, o que obrigou os policiais a forçarem sua entrada e levarem computadores e outros aparelhos que serão analisados por investigadores. As informações são da revista People.
Manson é acusado de assédio de abuso sexual por mais de 15 mulheres, entre elas, sua ex-noiva, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, estrela da série ‘Westworld’. Evan já havia relatado casos de abusos, mas sem citar nomes, mas no dia 1º de fevereiro, decidiu revelar o nome do abusador.
“O nome do meu abusador é Brian Warner, também conhecido mundialmente como Marilyn Manson. Ele começou a me aliciar quando eu ainda era um adolescente e abusou terrivelmente de mim por anos”, escreveu.
Evan, que anunciou o namoro com Manson em 2007, tinha 19, e ele o dobro, 38, disse que foi manipulada. “Eu sofria lavagem cerebral e fui manipulada à submissão. Estou cansada de viver com medo de retaliação, difamação ou chantagens. Eu estou aqui para expor esse homo perigoso e denunciar às indústrias que permitem atuar, antes que ele arruíne mais vidas. Eu estou ao lado das muitas vítimas que não vão mais se silenciar”
Após o pronunciamento da atriz, outras mulheres demonstraram apoio a Evan e relataram ter passado por situações semelhantes com o cantor. Em seu perfil, o artista rebateu as denúncias.
“Obviamente, minha vida e minha arte são há anos imãs para controvérsia, mas essas recentes declarações a meu respeito são distorções horríveis da realidade. Meus relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram completamente consensuais, com pessoas que pensavam como eu. Independente de como- e por que- outros estão escolhendo deturpar o passado agora, essa é a verdade”, escreveu Manson.
No início deste mês, uma ex-assistente do músico revelou que ele costumava trancar mulheres em uma espécie de casulo de vidro à prova de som. O relato dado à revista Rolling Stone é de Ashley Walters, ex-funcionária do cantor e uma das 15 mulheres que estão processando o artista. Ashley ainda contou que Manson gostava de contar às pessoas sobre o local. Entre as famosas que denunciaram o cantor, estão também Phoebe Bridgers e Esmé Bianco, que descreveu cenas de tortura durante a gravação de um clipe que fez com Manson.

Marilyn Manson's home raided in sexual assault investigation,"Singer and songwriter Marilyn Manson's home was raided by detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department on Monday after allegations of physical and sexual abuse by several women. Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Eva Jimenez said a search warrant was served on the home of Manson, whose legal name is Brian Hugh Warner. She would give no further details, as per legal documents obtained by the Hollywood Reporter.
Law enforcement sources told TMZ that Special Victims Unit detectives went to the shock rocker's home in West Hollywood early Monday morning, executing a search warrant. Reportedly, Marilyn was not home at the time and law enforcement forced entry with a warrant in hand.
Sources also told TMZ, say the search warrant is in connection to ongoing probes into sexual assault allegations against Marilyn and police seized media storage units, including hard drives, which will be reviewed before the case is submitted to the Los Angeles County District Attorney. As per The Hollywood Reporter, the Sheriff's Department said in February that its detectives had begun investigating Marilyn over reports of domestic violence between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where he lived at the time.
Several women have publicly alleged this year that they were physically, sexually and emotionally abused by Marilyn around the time of the incidents under investigation, and some have filed lawsuits. Marilyn's attorney Howard E. King declined immediate comment. Marilyn has denied the allegations too.
The 52-year-old shock rocker's former fiancee, Westworld actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post in February. In May, 'Game of Thrones' actor Esme Bianco also sued Marilyn in federal court, alleging sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Bianco alleged that Marilyn violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies. She also alleged that he deprived her of food and sleep, locked her in a bedroom, whipped her, gave her electric shocks and threatened to enter her room and rape her during the night.
Marilyn's former assistant also accused him of sexual assault, battery and harassment in her own lawsuit. (ANI)

De acuerdo a una investigación publicada por la revista Rolling Stone, Manson encerraba a sus parejas en ""una celda de confinamiento solitario"" con paredes de cristal, a la que se refería como 'La habitación de las chicas malas'. En ella, presuntamente perpetraba actos de maltrato mental, físico y sexual, los cuales dejaron a sus víctimas con episodios paralizantes de ansiedad, depresión, ataques de pánico y trastorno de estrés postraumático.

"Marilyn Manson: Μετά τις κατηγορίες για σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα, η αστυνομία έκανε έφοδο στο σπίτι του","Marilyn Manson: Μετά τις κατηγορίες για σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα, η αστυνομία έκανε έφοδο στο σπίτι του τραγουδιστή ενώ απουσίαζε σε εξωτερική δουλειά.
Μετά τις κατηγορίες για σεξουαλικές επιθέσεις και βιασμούς σε βάρος των συντρόφων του, η αστυνομία έκανε έφοδο στο σπίτι του Marilyn Manson την ώρα που απουσίαζε. Ο τραγουδιστής βρισκόταν σε κάποια εξωτερική δουλειά όταν οι ντετέκτιβ μπήκαν στον χώρο του με ένταλμα για να το κάνουν φύλλο και φτερό.
Σύμφωνα με το ΤΜΖ, πήραν τις «μονάδες αποθήκευσης πολυμέσων», ενώ εκπρόσωπος του σερίφη του Los Angeles δήλωσε πως είχε, μεν, γνώση της έρευνας, αλλά δεν μπορούσε να επιβεβαιώσει ή να διαψεύσει λεπτομέρειες.
Τι αποκάλυψαν οι πρώην του
Ο Manson, το πραγματικό όνομα του οποίου είναι Brian Warner, κατηγορείται για σεξουαλική παρενόχληση και κακοποίηση πολλών γυναικών, ανάμεσά τους και η πρώην αρραβωνιαστικιά του, Evan Rachel Wood. Εκείνη, αποκάλυψε τα όσα υπέστη στα χέρια του τον Φεβρουάριο, μέσω Instaram.
Τον εκκεντρικό σταρ κατήγγειλε και η ηθοποιός του Game of Thrones, Esmé Bianco. Σε μήνυση που κατέθεσε, υποστήριξε ότι την κακοποίησε σεξουαλικά, σωματικά και συναισθηματικά. Δεν την άφηνε να φάει και να κοιμηθεί, την κλείδωνε στην κρεβατοκάμαρα, τη μαστίγωνε, της έκανε ηλεκτροσόκ και την απειλούσε πως θα έμπαινε στο δωμάτιό της και θα τη βίαζε το βράδυ.
Σύμφωνα με τo Rolling Stone, ο Manson κλείδωνε τις γυναίκες σε ένα στούντιο ηχογράφησης, το οποίο είχε ηχομόνωση. Το έκανε για να τις τιμωρήσει. Μάλιστα, ονόμαζε τον χώρο «Δωμάτιο για Κακά Κορίτσια».
Μέχρι στιγμής, οι εκπρόσωποί του δεν έχουν προχωρήσει δηλώσεις.
Marilyn Manson: Τις κυνηγούσε με τσεκούρι, της απειλούσε με όπλα και τις άφηνε στο κρύο
O τραγουδιστής εκτός σκηνής, βάσει των αποκαλύψεων που έχουν γίνει γύρω από το όνομά του ήταν ένας βιαστής, που μετέτρεπε σε κόλαση τη ζωή των γυναικών. Ήταν ένα τέρας, όπως τον χαρακτηρίζει το περιοδικό «Rolling Stone», το οποίο με έρευνά του φέρνει στο φως την «κρυφή και ανώμαλη» ζωή του.
Την ώρα που όλοι τον θεωρούσαν «ροκ» εκείνος κυνηγούσε τις συντρόφους του με τσεκούρια, τις βίαζε και τις κακοποιούσε τόσο ψυχολογικά όσο και σεξουαλικά. Αρκετοί φίλοι του 52χρονου Μάνσον είπαν ότι ο τραγουδιστής τραβούσε βίντεο με τον ίδιο να κάνει στοματικό σεξ μέσα σε ντουλάπα και μάλιστα το μοιράζονταν, ενώ ένιωθε «περήφανος για αυτό». Το διαμέρισμά του ήταν ένα κολαστήριο για εκείνες. Είχε τσεκούρια, μαστίγια και ήταν γεμάτο αίμα, σβάστικες και πορνό.

Marilyn Manson: Hausdurchsuchung wegen Missbrauchsskandal,"Auf der Bühne inszeniert er sich wie aus einem Gothic-Horrorstreifen. Doch auch der echte Marilyn Manson hat offenbar eine dunkle Seele.

Insgesamt 15 Frauen, darunter US-Schauspielerin und Ex-Freundin Evan Rachel Wood (34), beschuldigen den Sänger des sexuellen, körperlichen oder emotionalen Missbrauchs. Sogar von Vergewaltigung ist die Rede.
Drei Jahre (bis 2010) waren Industrial-Rocker Marilyn Manson und „Westworld“-Star Evan Rachel Wood ein Paar Foto: SCOTT WINTROW/AFP
Als wäre das nicht schlimm genug, berichtete dann auch noch das Magazin „Rolling Stone“, Manson hätte seine früheren Partnerinnen immer wieder in einen kleinen, schalldichten Raum eingesperrt. Als Strafe, wenn sie sich angeblich „schlecht“ benommen hatten. Das fanden die Autoren in Gesprächen mit insgesamt 55 Personen heraus.
Eva Jimenez, Deputy-Sheriff der Polizei von Los Angeles, soll nun Mansons Haus in West Hollywood einer Durchsuchung unterzogen haben. Laut „TMZ“-Quellen waren dazu sogar mehrere Spezialeinheiten vor Ort.

Bianco – who played Ros on the HBO fantasy drama – had previously accused Manson of physically and emotionally abusing her during their relationship, which ended in early 2011 after the pair had been living together for two months. And she went on to formally submit paperwork to bring a lawsuit against Manson where she documented all of the alleged instances of abuse that she previously spoke about during an interview in February this year. His former assistant Ashley Walters claimed the musician used “torture tactics” to control her.

Authorities searched Marilyn Manson’s West Hollywood home on November 29, reportedly as part of a probe into allegations of physical and sexual abuse that several women have made against the rock artist. TMZ was the first to report that Special Victims Unit detectives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department had forcibly entered Manson’s residence early Monday morning. According to TMZ, Manson (whose legal name is Brian Warner) was not home at the time of the search. Law enforcement reportedly seized media storage units, such as hard drives, for review.
Deputy Eva Jimenez of the Sheriff’s Information Bureau told the Washington Post that a search warrant was served on Manson’s home, but gave no further details. In February 2021, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department confirmed that it was investigating Manson for alleged incidents of domestic violence in West Hollywood between 2009 and 2011.

Marilyn Manson's Hard Drives Seized From Home As Police Execute Search Warrant: Report,"His recent appearance alongside Kanye West at Sunday Service wasn't enough to keep authorities away from Marilyn Manson. The disgraced shock-rocker is the subject of several lawsuits brought forth by women who allege that they have been victims of Manson. From ex-girlfriends to a former assistant, women have made claims that Manson sexually abused or raped them.
West has been seemingly taking Manson under his wing as the rocker appeared with him at Donda's Chicago listening event and later, Manson was huddled with West and Justin Bieber at Sunday Service. However, things took a turn on Monday (November 29) when Manson's home was reportedly raided by police.

Manson was not at the home when investigators with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department entered to execute the warrant, according to TMZ, which cited law enforcement sources.

Sheriff Detectives Raid Marilyn Manson’s Hollywood Home,"Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department detectives today served a search warrant at Marilyn Manson’s West Hollywood apartment in an investigation related to ongoing sexual assault and sexual battery allegations against the singer.
Sheriff’s investigators entered the residence early Monday morning and seized media storage units including hard drives, though Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, was not at home at the time of the search, TMZ reported.
Deputy Eva Jimenez of the Sheriff’s Information Bureau confirmed to City News Service that the warrant was served at the West Hollywood apartment, though no further details were immediately available.
Warner was sued in April by Game of Thrones actress Esme Bianco for alleged sexual assault and sexual battery in what she described as a series of violent encounters.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court, alleged that Warner had used “fraudulent offers of movie and music video roles to convince Ms. Bianco to travel to Los Angeles, whereupon Mr. Warner then made threats of force and performed violent sexual acts on Ms. Bianco to which she did not consent.”
Also named in the suit is Warner’s former manager, Tony Ciulla, who is accused along with his management company of violating trafficking laws.
According to the lawsuit, Bianco, 38, was invited to Los Angeles from the United Kingdom by Warner with the promise of work, and after moving into the Goth rocker’s West Hollywood apartment in 2011, she was not allowed to eat, sleep or leave without his permission.
“Mr. Warner raped Ms. Bianco in or around May 2011,” the suit alleges.
Warner’s attorney, Howard E. King, said the allegations have no merit.
“These claims are provably false,” King said in a statement provided to City News Service. “To be clear, this suit was only filed after my client refused to be shaken down by Ms. Bianco and her lawyer and give in to their
outrageous financial demands based on conduct that simply never occurred. We will vigorously contest these allegations in court and are confident that we will prevail.”
In February, actress Evan Rachel Wood accused Warner of sexual and physical abuse during their relationship, which lasted from January 2007 until August 2010. His record label, Loma Vista Recordings, dropped him following Wood’s accusation.
Warner denied Wood’s allegations in a social media post.
After Wood’s accusations, the sheriff’s department confirmed that its Special Victims Bureau was investigating the 52-year-old Warner for alleged domestic violence.

La casa della rockstar Marilyn Manson è stata perquisita dopo le accuse di abusi fisici e sessuali da parte di diverse donne. Una indagine partita dopo le denunce di violenze avvenute tra il 2009 e il 2011 a West Hollywood, dove viveva. Le presunte vittime - circa una quindicina - non sono state rese note, ma in molte hanno dichiarato pubblicamente di essere state abusate fisicamente, sessualmente ed emotivamente da Manson nello stesso periodo.
Manson, emerso come star musicale a metà degli anni '90 con ""The Beautiful People"", ""Antichrist Superstar"" e ""Mechanical Animals"", ha negato le accuse.
L'ex fidanzata Evan Rachel Wood lo ha definito ""violentatore"", suscitando la risposta di Manson: ""Affermazioni che sono orribili distorsioni della realtà"".
A raccontare in tribunale retroscena sui presunti abusi è stata anche Esmé Bianco, volto in ""Game of Thrones"" che ha sostenuto di essere stata rinchiusa da Manson in una camera da letto, privata di cibo e sonno, frustata, costretta con droghe a pratiche sessuali e scosse elettriche. Secondo Bianco il cantante avrebbe infranto persino le ""leggi sul traffico di essere umani"", quando nel 2011 la fece spostare da Londra negli Stati Uniti ""attirandola con promesse di lavoro"" per una clip musicale mai uscita.

10/10 Dem Verkauf seiner Villa stand das allerdings nicht im Weg.
Marilyn Manson (52) hat genug von den Hollywood Hills. Der Schock-Rocker hat laut «TMZ» seine Villa in Los Angeles verkauft – und dabei ordentlich plus gemacht. 2013 kaufte er sich die Villa für 1.1 Millionen Dollar (ca. 1.02 Millionen Franken), im Oktober hat er sie für 1.75 Millionen Dollar (ca. 1.63 Millionen Franken) ausgeschrieben. Der Käufer soll laut dem News-Portal jetzt aber 1.83 Millionen Dollar (ca. 1.71 Millionen Franken) dafür bezahlt haben.
Die Villa bietet dem neuen Besitzer Luxus auf über 250 Quadratmeter mit drei Badezimmern, drei Schlafzimmern, einer Garage und einem Garten. Dass hier früher ein Schock-Rocker wohnte, ist auf den Bildern dazu nicht zu sehen. Für die Fotos der Maklerseite liess Manson all seine persönlichen Einrichtungsstücke entfernen.
Hatte Manson einen «Vergewaltigungsraum»?
Wurde Manson Hollywood zu heiss? Zahlreiche Frauen haben dem Musiker vorgeworfen, sie physisch, psychisch und sexuell missbraucht zu haben. Dabei spielten auch die Domizile von Manson immer wieder eine Rolle. So soll er etwa in einer Wohnung in West Hollywood eine schalldichte Glaszelle eingerichtet haben, um seine Partnerinnen einzusperren. Ein anderes mutmassliches Opfer berichtete, dass Manson eines der Zimmer in seinem Haus als «Vergewaltigungsraum» bezeichnete. Ob damit das Haus gemeint ist, dass nun verkauft wurde, ist nicht bekannt.
Im Rahmen der Vorwürfe bekam Manson in dem nun verkauften Haus in Hollywood auch schon Besuch von der Polizei. Nachdem seine Ex-Verlobte Evan Rachel Wood (34) das erste Mal öffentlich machte, wie sehr Manson sie gequält habe, rief ein Freund die Beamten an, da er Manson nicht erreichen konnte. Der Freund hatte Angst davor, dass sich der Sänger etwas antun würde. Mehrere Beamte tauchten vor Ort auf, sogar ein Polizei-Helikopter kreiste über dem Gebäude. Doch auch sie konnten Manson nicht erreichen. Durch einen Sprecher liess er danach laut «TMZ» verlauten, dass es ihm gut gehe, er aber einfach keine Lust gehabt habe, die Tür zu öffnen.

"Nickelback's Chad Kroeger, Avril Lavigne, and Marilyn Manson Once Made a Song Together","Nickelback‘s Chad Kroeger gave the world many classic rock songs, including a duet between Avril Lavigne and Marilyn Manson. During an interview, Lavigne revealed Kroeger helped her craft one of her albums as they fell in love. She also revealed why she felt a duet between her and Manson was “meant to be.”

Avril Lavigne said Nickelback’s Chad Kroeger courted her through songs
Kroeger and Lavigne were married from 2013 to 2015. During a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Lavigne explained how they fell in love. “Well, we really just started out as friends,” she recalled. “Chad, David Hodges and myself — the three of us were writing together.
“We just hit it off, and then we started dating later on,” Lavigne added. “It was really sweet, because a month into dating, he proposed in the studio where we met and spent all our time making the record.” The record in question was Lavigne’s self-titled album. Lavigne said the album Avril Lavigne was essentially her courtship with Kroeger. It includes such hits as “Here’s to Never Growing Up,” “Rock n Roll,” and “Hello Kitty.”

Why Avril Lavigne wanted to perform a song with Marilyn Manson
Later in the interview, Lavigne discussed collaborating with Manson on a song called “Bad Girl” from Avril Lavigne. “It was really cool,” she opined.” As I was listening to the song, I was like, ‘Manson would kill this!’ So I called him. He came over at like four in the morning …”
Lavigne said the song came together even though Manson’s schedule could have gotten in the way. “It worked out!” she exclaimed. “It was meant to be. [Laughs.] Things are never that easy when you’re trying to get together with someone. He could have been anywhere in the world.”
Lavigne had kind things to say about Manson. “He’s been a friend of mine since I was 18,” she recalled. “I went to his concert in Toronto and met him backstage. We’ve been friendly throughout the years. I respect him as an artist.” Lavigne noted Manson knew exactly what he wanted to add to “Bad Girl.” She felt he “nailed” his vocals on the song.

The way the world reacted to ‘Bad Girl’
Lavigne did not release “Bad Girl” as a single and it did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100. On the other hand, Avril Lavigne was a hit. It peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, remaining on the chart for 12 weeks. Thus far, it’s Lavigne’s final album to hit the top five in the United States.
The Official Charts Company reports “Bad Girl” did not chart in the United Kingdom either. Regardless, Avril Lavigne hit No. 14 in the U.K., lasting on the chart for four weeks. While “Bad Girl” isn’t one of Lavigne’s most famous songs, it serves as an interesting connection between Kroeger, Lavigne, and Manson.

Esta declaración ocurrió después de que, durante el martes 23 de noviembre, se anunciara que Manson está nominado para un Grammy 2022 por su trabajo como artista invitado y compositor de Donda, el último álbum de Kanye West.

"Grammys criticized for nominating Marilyn Manson, CEO defends decision","Grammy CEO Harvey Mason defended the decision to nominate Manson, who is accused of sexual assault
After the Recording Academy came under fire for nominating controversial musician Marilyn Manson at the 2022 Grammys despite him being accused of sexual assault, CEO Harvey Mason Jr. has come out to defend its decision.
Speaking to The Wrap on Tuesday, Mason said that the Academy doesn’t ‘restrict’ individuals from submitting their names for consideration.
“We won’t look back at people’s history, we won’t look at their criminal record, we won’t look at anything other than the legality within our rules... is this recording eligible based on date and other criteria. If it is, they can submit for consideration.”
However, he did say that the Grammys will closely control the actual ceremony on January 31, 2022 at the Staples Center.
“What we will control is our stages, our shows, our events, our red carpets,” said Mason.
“We’ll take a look at anyone who is asking to be a part of that, asking to be in attendance, and we’ll make our decisions at that point. But we’re not going to be in the business of restricting people from submitting their work for our voters to decide on.”

As is the case every year, the 2022 Grammy nominations were full of some surprising names, from 11-time nominee Jon Batiste to first-timers like ABBA and Selena Gomez. There were also names that made for a more uncomfortable surprise: Dr. Luke, Marilyn Manson, and Louis C.K., three men accused of varying forms of sexual abuse and assault. Dr. Luke’s three nominations (for writing and producing on Doja Cat’s “Kiss Me More” and Planet Her [Deluxe] as well as Saweetie and Doja Cat’s “Best Friend”) were not his first since Kesha accused him of sexual abuse, after he was nominated for Record of the Year in 2020 for his work on Doja Cat’s “Say So.” But Manson’s two nominations (for writing on Kanye West’s “Jail” in Best Rap Song and Album of the Year) and C.K.’s one (for Sincerely Louis C.K. in Best Comedy Album) were the first since their allegations. Addressing the nominations in an interview with the Wrap, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said the Grammys “won’t restrict the people who can submit their material for consideration.” He continued, “We won’t look back at people’s history, we won’t look at their criminal record, we won’t look at anything other than the legality within our rules of, Is this recording for this work eligible based on date and other criteria?”
The question of if and how awards ceremonies should address problematic nominees has been haunting other shows for the past few months, particularly in relation to Morgan Wallen, the country star who said a racial slur on video in February. While shows like the ACM Awards removed him from contention, the CMAs allowed his albums and songs to be nominated to recognize his collaborators, and the American Music Awards kept him in the chart-based categories — but all shows said he would not be allowed to attend. While Wallen’s case is obviously different from those of musicians accused of abuse and assault (and Wallen, who was also fully eligible, earned zero Grammy nominations), Mason Jr. hinted at similar restrictions on attendance. “What we will control is our stages, our shows, our events, our red carpets,” he told the Wrap. “We’ll take a look at anyone who is asking to be a part of that, asking to be in attendance, and we’ll make our decisions at that point.” The 2022 Grammys take place on January 31.",2021-11-24T18:39:53Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
Grammys CEO Says “We Won’t Look at People’s History” After Marilyn Manson and Louis C.K. Get 2022 Nominations,"Recording Academy President and CEO Harvey Mason, jr. has defended the Academy after Marilyn Manson and Louis C.K. received nominations for next year’s Grammy Awards. Mason told TheWrap that personal and legal matters won’t affect artists’ eligibility, suggesting that the Recording Academy would exercise more control over Grammy night invitees. Manson is the subject of multiple sexual assault lawsuits, and was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Rap Song for his respective contributions to Kanye West’s Donda and “Jail.” C.K., who was nominated for Best Comedy Album, has admitted numerous instances of sexual misconduct.
“We won’t restrict the people who can submit their material for consideration,” Mason told TheWrap. “We won’t look back at people’s history, we won’t look at their criminal record, we won’t look at anything other than the legality within our rules of, is this recording for this work eligible based on date and other criteria.

But we’re not going to be in the business of restricting people from submitting their work for our voters to decide on.”
Pitchfork has reached out to Recording Academy representatives for additional comment and information.
The Grammys were under fire last year when Lukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald received a Record of the Year nomination for his pseudonymous work as Tyson Trax on Doja Cat’s “Say So.” Fiona Apple accused the Academy of betraying Kesha, who has alleged abuse by Dr. Luke. “They had [Kesha] up there singing ‘Praying,’” Apple said, “and now they’re gonna go: ‘Oh but it’s Tyson Trax!’” Gottwald received three 2022 nominations for work with Doja Cat.
Other 2022 Grammy nominees include Dave Chappelle, whose history of transphobia has come under scrutiny in the wake of his Netflix stand-up special The Closer. He was nominated in the Best Spoken Word category for 8:46, alongside poet Amir Sulaiman. In addition, DaBaby, who faced backlash after making homophobic remarks during a July performance, is nominated twice in the Album of the Year category (for his contributions to Justin Bieber’s Justice (Triple Chucks Deluxe) and Kanye West’s Donda).

Grammys 2022: Marilyn Manson et Dave Chappelle nommés malgré les polémiques,"Capture Danny Moloshok via Reuters/Yuri Gripas via Reuters Marilyn Manson (à gauche) et Dave Chappelle (à droite) sont respectivement nommés dans les catégories ""meilleur album"" et ""meilleur album parlé"" aux Grammy Awards 2022.
MUSIQUE - Pas de “cancel culture” aux Grammy Awards 2022. La Recording Academy a levé le voile sur les nommés de la 64e édition de la cérémonie ce mardi 23 novembre.
Si la présence de certains artistes comme Doja Cat, Billie Eilish, Justin Bieber, Kanye West ou encore Olivia Rodrigo n’a rien d’une surprise, celle des controversés Dave Chappelle, en lice pour le meilleur album parlé avec 8:46 et Marilyn Manson, présent sur l’album Donda de Kanye West (nommé pour l’album de l’année), est plus étonnante.
Le premier a défrayé la chronique en octobre pour des propos jugés transphobes lors de son spectacle The Closer diffusé sur Netflix. Il y a notamment pris la défense de J.K. Rowling, elle aussi accusée de transphobie.
“Le genre est un fait. Chaque être humain dans cette pièce, chaque être humain sur Terre a dû passer entre les jambes d’une femme pour être sur Terre. C’est un fait”, avait-il dans un premier temps déclaré à l’époque. Et d’ajouter: “Maintenant, je ne dis pas que les femmes trans ne sont pas des femmes, je dis juste que ces chattes qu’elles ont… vous voyez ce que je veux dire?”.
Ces blagues avaient par la suite poussé trois employés de la plateforme de streaming, suspendus depuis, à interrompre une réunion virtuelle des dirigeants de la plateforme pour protester contre leur diffusion. Les appels au boycott et à la suppression du spectacle s’étaient également multipliés, sans succès, Netflix défendant coûte que coûte sa programmation.
“Pas de restriction”
En ce qui concerne Brian Hugh Warner alias Marilyn Manson, il est accusé par plusieurs femmes, dont les actrices Esmé Bianco et Rachel Wood, d’agressions sexuelles et de viols. Des accusations que le rockeur réfute depuis plusieurs mois.
“Mon art et ma vie ont toujours attiré la controverse”, a-t-il notamment écrit sur Instagram en février dernier. “Mais ces affirmations me concernant sont des déformations affreuses de la réalité. Mes relations intimes ont toujours été entièrement consenties, avec des partenaires en accord”, a-t-il assuré.
Les deux artistes ne sont pas les seuls nommés à avoir suscité la controverse ces dernières années. Les humoristes et acteurs Louis CK et Kevin Hart sont de leur côté tous deux nommés dans la catégorie du meilleur album de comédie. Le premier a reconnu avoir harcelé sexuellement certaines femmes et le second a tenu des propos homophobes par le passé, qui ont refait surface en 2018.
“La Recording Academy ne fera pas de restriction”, a justifié Harvey Mason JR., le patron des Grammys, à The Wrap. “Nous ne prenons pas en compte l’histoire des gens, nous n’examinerons pas leur casier judiciaire, juste le respect de nos règles. Si le travail est recevable, selon les dates et d’autres critères, alors il peut être soumis à examen.”
Et de préciser: “Ce que nous contrôlons, ce sont nos scènes, nos shows, nos événements, nos tapis rouges. Nous examinerons le cas de tous ceux qui demandent à participer à ce processus, à être présents, et nous prendrons nos décisions à ce moment-là. Mais nous n’allons pas empêcher les gens de soumettre leur travail à nos électeurs”.
À l’image des César en 2020, qui avaient nommé Roman Polanski - pourtant accusé de viol - dans 12 catégories pour son film J’accuse (il avait d’ailleurs remporté le prix du meilleur réalisateur), les Grammys ont donc choisi de faire table rase des controverses passées.

"Louis C.K., Marilyn Manson score Grammy nominations after allegations of misconduct","Louis C.K., Marilyn Manson, Dave Chappelle and Kevin Hart all received Grammy nominations on Tuesday, prompting some on social media to question the existence of so-called cancel culture.
All four of the nominees, who have been labeled by some as victims of cancel culture, have generated backlash in the last few years for various controversies.
In 2017, C.K. admitted to sexual misconduct. The comedian, who continued to tour a year after the allegations first surfaced, also sparked outrage after he mocked Parkland survivors in a stand-up routine in 2018.
C.K. has not been charged with any crime connected to his sexual misconduct.
He received a Best Comedy Album nomination for his most recent special, ""Sincerely Louis C.K.,"" in which he joked about his sexual misconduct.
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, faces sexual assault lawsuits from several women, including ""Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco, who filed a lawsuit in April against Manson alleging he committed multiple violent sexual assaults, a rape and other abuse from 2009 to 2013.
Manson has not been charged with any crime connected to the alleged incidents. A representative for the goth singer has repeatedly denied all accusations of sexual assault.
In February, Manson addressed abuse allegations made against him at the time by ex-partner Evan Rachel Wood. He wrote in an Instagram post: “My art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
He's nominated for his work on Kanye West's ""Donda."" In August, West flabbergasted fans at one of his listening parties after inviting Manson on stage with him.
Chappelle is nominated alongside Amir Sulaiman for Best Spoken Word Album for ""8:46.""
The comedian came under fire in October after the release of his most recent Netflix special,“The Closer,” which trans Netflix workers and allies said included transphobic and homophobic content.
Many Netflix employees walked out of the company’s headquarters in Los Angeles to protest its continued streaming of the special. The company’s CEO, Ted Sarandos, has held fast with Chappelle, but he said Oct. 19 that “I screwed up“ when it came to communicating with employees genuinely hurt by Chappelle’s words.
In a video posted to his Instagram following the backlash, Chappelle responded to criticism of his Netflix special.
He ended the video by suggesting that he has yet to be fully “canceled.”
“You have to answer the question, ‘Am I canceled or not?’” he said. The crowd shouted back, “No.”
“Then let’s go,” Chappelle said. “Thank you very much, and good night.”
Hart pulled out of hosting the 2019 Academy Awards after some of his old tweets and jokes, which some at the time called homophobic, resurfaced.
“I have made the choice to step down from hosting this year’s Oscar’s. ... This is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists,” he tweeted in 2018. “I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.”
Hart, who is nominated in the Best Comedy Album category for ""Zero F***s Given,"" recently defended Chappelle, who he called his brother, in an interview with the New York Times published on Tuesday.
""That man don’t have a hateful bone in his body,"" he told the publication. ""And I don’t say that because it’s hypothetical — I say that because I know him. I know his world. I know that he embraces the LGBT+ community, because he has friends who are close to him from that community. I know that his kids understand equality, fair treatment, love. I know that his wife embeds that in their kids. I know why people embrace him. He’s a good dude.""
Some on social media shared negative responses to the news of the nominations.
""Lous CK, Kevin Hart, and Dave Chappelle were all nominated for Grammys?"" Adrienne Lawrence, a legal analyst, tweeted. ""If this is 'cancel culture,' may every woman comedian I know be cancelled instead of simply underpaid and unrecognized.""""Louis C.K., Dave Chappelle, Kanye, DaBaby, and Marilyn Manson all nominated for Grammys today. Still waiting for “Cancel Culture” to be real,"" wrote Jillian Sederholm.
""only one grammy nom each for dave chappelle, kevin hart, and louis CK!! cancel culture strikes again!!"" joked David Mack.
The Recording Academy did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment regarding the reaction.

Advogado de Marilyn Manson admite chegar a acordo com mulheres que o acusam de violência sexual,"Músico nega as acusações de que é alvo mas a sua defesa admite entrar em processo de mediação conjunto com as quatro queixosas nos tribunais, rumo a um acordo.
O advogado do músico Brian Warner, conhecido como Marilyn Manson, admitiu sexta-feira em tribunal que poderá ser possível chegar a acordo com as várias mulheres que o acusam de agressão sexual em diferentes processos legais. O músico é alvo das acusações de pelo menos quatro mulheres em processos cíveis. Mais de uma dezena de queixosas vieram a público nos últimos meses dizer que o músico as violou e torturou. Esta semana, essas acusações foram detalhadas numa investigação da revista Rolling Stone.
“Há outros casos que estão de alguma forma relacionados [com este, uma acusação de uma artista que diz que Warner a violou violentamente em 2011] e à medida que as coisas avancem podemos decidir que é melhor ter mediação global. Não penso que isso vá acontecer em breve, mas é provável que aconteça”, disse Stephen D. Rothschild numa audiência em Los Angeles relacionada com o caso movido por uma ex-namorada, música, e que escolheu ser identificada apenas como “Jane Doe” no processo. O advogado abre assim a porta a uma chegada a acordo com as várias acusadoras do músico, que tem negado sempre quaisquer actos sexuais sem o consentimento das suas parceiras.
O caso de “Jane Doe” já tem julgamento marcado, para 3 de Outubro de 2023, depois de inicialmente nem ter sido aceite pelo juiz devido à prescrição dos alegados crimes.
A actriz Evan Rachel Wood, que começou a namorar com Brian Warner aos 18 anos, revelou em Fevereiro num post nas redes sociais que viveu uma relação abusiva com o músico. No mesmo dia, outras mulheres denunciaram comportamentos semelhantes do vocalista, ocorridas no âmbito de relações amorosas e sem o consentimento das mulheres. Os casos remontam há mais de uma década. As alegadas vítimas não se conheciam e só recentemente ficaram cientes das histórias umas das outras, bem como dos padrões de manipulação psicológica, isolamento e violência sexual a que o músico alegadamente sujeitou várias mulheres.
Brian Warner e os seus representantes legais negam “veementemente” as acusações e mais recentemente lamentaram que as acusadoras associassem e tentassem alegadamente confundir a imagem artística do músico, na persona Marilyn Manson — homónima da sua banda, que já actuou várias vezes em Portugal e que se lançou nos anos 1990 para deixar uma forte marca de “shock rock” na cultura popular — à sua conduta pessoal.
Uma investigação da Rolling Stone, publicada na madrugada de segunda-feira, e uma outra reportagem anterior do Los Angeles Times não só detalham as acusações das mulheres como defendem que a imagem transgressora do músico permitiu em parte ofuscar, mesmo quando este produzia declarações públicas sobre como queria “esmagar o crânio” de Evan Rachel Wood ou quando usava mulheres maltratadas como adereço em palco, anos de comportamentos alegadamente violentos na sua vida privada.",2021-11-20T11:35:11Z,https://www.publico.pt,PÚBLICO

Sin embargo, Manson rediseñó este cuarto cuando se mudó para convertirlo en un “cuarto de tortura”. “Dicen que Warner solía desterrar a sus novias allí, manteniéndolas dentro durante horas y horas para castigarlas por las más pequeñas transgresiones percibidas”, publicó la revista.

Marilyn Manson hizo referencia a la habitación
La revista Rolling Stones recordó el día en que Marilyn Manson habló, en una entrevista para diversos medios, sobre el temido lugar. “Si alguien es malo, puedo encerrarlo y está insonorizado”, dijo en 2012.
En ese momento, dichas declaraciones eran tomadas como parte de la excéntrica y misteriosa personalidad de quien es también conocido como el ‘Anticristo’.
¿Cómo era la mencionada habitación?
Ashley Morgan Smithline, quien demandó al músico por agresión sexual y encarcelamiento ilegal, describió el cuarto como un espacio similar al de un “camerino de una tienda de ropa” y dijo que, “al principio, lo hizo sonar genial”. “Después lo hizo sonar muy punitivo. Incluso gritaba, nadie me escucharía”, recordó según la revista Rolling Stones.
Otras mujeres que brindaron su testimonio para la investigación mencionaron que la habitación estaba decorado con sangre, esvásticas y fotos recortadas de revistas porno.",2021-11-18T20:30:26Z,https://larepublica.pe,LaRepública.pe

Nina Lemos é jornalista e escritora e mora em Berlim. É feminista das antigas e uma das criadoras do 02 Neurônio, que lançou cinco livros e teve um site no UOL no começo de 2000. Foi colunista da Folha de S. Paulo, repórter especial da revista Tpm e blogueira do Estadão e do Yahoo. Escreveu também o romance ""A Ditadura da Moda"".
Por anos, e quando já era uma celebridade, o cantor Marilyn Manson (nome artístico de Brian Warner) manteve em seu apartamento em Los Angeles um ""quarto do castigo"", um local com paredes de vidro e à prova de som onde trancava mulheres e as torturava psicologicamente, segundo relatos das de diversas mulheres à revista americana ""Rolling Stone"". Elas contam que o local parecia um ""frigorífico"" e ali eram trancadas se fizessem algo que chateasse o cantor.
Em uma apuração de nove meses, a revista ouviu mais de 55 mulheres e testemunhas. Há cinco processos contra ele na Justiça. Se for comprovado, estamos diante de um criminoso perigoso, um abusador serial de mulheres sádico, que tinha prazer não só em abusar e torturar, mas também em contar para as pessoas o que fazia.
Segundo pessoas próximas ao cantor ouvidas pela revista americana, o tal quartinho de Manson era conhecido por todos e uma piada entre amigos. Em 2012, Manson chegou a falar a uma outra revista que ""prendia mulheres que não se comportavam direito em um quarto"".
Ninguém levou a sério. Tudo parecia mais uma esquisitice do artista, que fez sucesso justamente se apresentando como um sujeito cheio de esquisitices. Muitos de seus amigos e pessoas que trabalhavam com ele teriam visto o tal quarto e ninguém fez nada.
A cumplicidade de todos é uma das coisas que mais chocam nessa história cheia de detalhes bizarros. A indústria da música fingiu que não viu, os fãs idolatravam suas letras soturnas (ele tem uma música instrumental chamada ""Baboon Rape Party"", algo como ""festa do estupro do babuíno"") e Manson não escondeu suas ideias nem dos jornalistas.
Ameaça de morte
Em uma entrevista à revista ""Spin"" em 2009, ele disse que todos os dias tinha fantasias de ""esmagar o crânio de uma ex com um martelo"". Essa ex-namorada, no caso, é a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, a primeira mulher a denunciá-lo em público esse ano. Entre outras coisas, ela fala que foi ameaçada de morte por ele.
Por anos, as frases sobre estupro e sobre desejo de matar mulheres foram vistos como excentricidade. E Manson, sua gravadora e empresários continuaram lucrando. Ou seja, parte da indústria musical teria sido cúmplice.
No momento, 12 mulheres acusam Manson. Cinco delas já movem processos contra ele. Em depoimentos à revista, ex-namoradas do cantor narraram torturas físicas e psicológicas durante os relacionamentos com ele e disseram que também que foram vítimas de estupro.
Uma das que o acusam, a atriz Esmé Bianco, afirma que, nos dois anos em que manteve um relacionamento com o cantor, foi estuprada, sofreu choques e privação de sono e de comida, além de ameaças de morte.
O caso chocante de Manson nos deixa vários alertas. Um deles é que artista também é gente e suas falas devem ser levadas a sério. E, claro, o caso pode abrir a caixa de pandora dos abusos que acontecem no mundo do rock, um ambiente extremamente machista, onde por anos quebrar cadeiras e ter groupies era visto como prova de ""ser rock'n'roll"" de verdade.
A indústria da música, que movimenta milhões, teria passado pano para os abusos, provavelmente por causa do lucro. Rumores e acusações contra Manson aconteceram em toda sua carreira, mas parece que foram deixados para lá.
O caso está na Justiça. Se não fosse a coragem das mulheres que o denunciaram, é provável que Marilyn Manson continuasse abusando de outras mulheres — e fazendo sucesso e lucrando.",2021-11-18T03:00:00Z,https://www.uol.com.br,UOL

Denuncian que Marilyn Manson encerraba a mujeres en celda de vidrio para maltratarlas psicológicamente,"La estrella del rock industrial estadounidense Marilyn Manson otra vez se encuentra en el ojo de la tormenta. El artista se ha visto envuelto en denuncias por abuso físico, psicológico y sexual por parte de sus exparejas. Así lo dio a conocer una investigación de la revista The Rolling Stones, donde cuentan escalofriantes relatos de las abusivas y violentas prácticas del músico.
Según la publicación, el polémico artista tenía una fijación por encerrar a sus parejas o las mujeres con las que estaba saliendo en un cuarto de vidrio, ubicado en su apartamento de West Hollywood, para maltratarlas.
Considera uno de los icónicos del rock, Manson ha sido acusado por más de 55 personas cercanas a él y afirmaron que este lugar era llamado por el músico como “la habitación de las chicas malas”.
“Una década antes de que Marilyn Manson alquilara el apartamento encima de una licorería de West Hollywood alrededor de 2010, un antiguo inquilino, un sello y estudio de grabación especializado en música electrónica, había construido el estrecho cerramiento de vidrio en la esquina de una habitación con el objetivo de música house. El único adorno fue un poco de espuma para insonorizar las paredes”, se lee en la investigación.
El espacio señalado por las denunciantes fue construido por el anterior inquilino del departamento que ocupaba Manson, y tenía como objetivo ser una cabina de grabación. El músico llegó y la rediseñó para poder ejercer sus escalofriantes fechorías.
Una exasistente de Manson, Ashley Walters, que lo demandó por agresión sexual, contó que el músico “siempre” bromeaba y se jactaba de la habitación. Pero otro otra persona cercana al artista aseguró que nunca vio a alguna mujer confinada en el cuarto de vidrio habitación.

"Sale a la luz una ""sala de tortura"" en la casa de Marilyn Manson, donde encerraba a ""las chicas malas""","Sale a la luz una «sala de tortura» en la casa de Marilyn Manson, donde encerraba a «las chicas malas» Una investigación de Rolling Stone ha revelado escabrosos nuevos detalles de sus maltratos a las mujeres que le acusan de abuso sexual

El culebrón al estilo marqués de Sade que desde hace meses rodea la vida de Marilyn Manson parece no tener final. Tras la serie de revelaciones que han ido saliendo con cuentagotas acerca de sus relaciones abusivas con distintas mujeres a lo largo de los años, una nueva investigación de la revista Rolling Stone ha sacado a la luz otro detalle escabroso, incluso terrorífico.
El cantante, de nombre real Brian Warner, tenía en su casa de West Hollywood una 'sala de tortura' donde encerraba a sus víctimas durante horas sin que nadie pudiera socorrerlas por más que gritaran, ya que estaba insonorizada. Era un pequeño cuarto del tamaño de un probador, construido como un estudio de grabación casero, pero que él utilizaba como 'cámara de castigo' para 'las chicas malas', algo que, sorprendentemente, dijo en público durante una entrevista hace casi diez años.
Ashley Walters, ex asistente que demandó a Warner por agresión sexual y otros cargos, dice que él disfrutaba cuando le contaba a la gente lo que hacía en aquella sala: «Siempre lo decía con un tono de broma, pero fanfarroneaba con ello». Otra denunciante, Ashley Morgan Smithline, que acusa a Manson de agresión sexual y encarcelamiento ilegal, ha contado que el artista la obligó varias veces a quedarse encerrada allí durante horas. «Al principio, hacía que la idea sonara genial. Pero después se convirtió en una especie de castigo contra el que no podías hacer nada. Aunque yo me hubiese pasado todo ese tiempo gritando, nadie me habría escuchado. Cuando quería meterme allí, yo peleaba y él disfrutaba de esa lucha. Pero al final aprendí que no podía luchar contra eso, porque le estaba dando lo que quería. Simplemente escondí la experiencia en otra parte de mi cabeza».
El resto del apartamento de Manson estaba decorado con sangre, esvásticas y fotos recortadas de revistas porno. «Había vaginas por todas partes», cuenta en el reportaje una persona que visitó el lugar. Otros recuerdan un mensaje pintado con aerosol sobre su cama que decía 'SIDA'. Las alfombras, los muebles y la decoración eran negros, al igual que las cortinas que usaba para tapar la luz de todas las ventanas casi las 24 horas del día. La temperatura del cuarto siempre era gélida; si alguien ajustaba el termostato para que hiciera algo de calor, el músico entraba en cólera y se ponía a destrozar los muebles. Una ex novia llamó al lugar 'el congelador negro', otra, 'el armario de carne'. Todas las ex novias que pasaron por allí aseguran que Manson les infligió repetidos actos de abuso mental, físico y sexual que las han dejado con episodios paralizantes de ansiedad, depresión, ataques de pánico y trastorno de estrés postraumático.
Para sus acusadoras, algunas de los cuales no han hablado públicamente o en profundidad sobre esto antes, Marilyn Manson es un depredador sexual en serie que le ha estado diciendo al mundo quién es durante más de 25 años a través de sus canciones. El propio Brian Warner se defendió de todas estas acusaciones con este comunicado: «Obviamente, mi arte y mi vida han sido durante mucho tiempo imanes de controversia, pero estas afirmaciones recientes sobre mí son horribles distorsiones de la realidad. Mis relaciones íntimas siempre han sido totalmente consensuadas con socios de ideas afines. Independientemente de cómo, y por qué, otros ahora eligen tergiversar el pasado, esa es la verdad».
La primera mujer que denunció a Manson por hechos similares fue la actriz Evan Rachel Wood, que aseguró que el cantante «abusó horriblemente» de ella durante la relación que tuvieron de tres años, y que recibió varias amenazas para que no hiciera pública su historia «Estoy aquí para poner en evidencia a este hombre peligroso y llamar la atención a la industria del entretenimiento que le ha permitido hacer estas cosas, antes de que arruine más vidas. Estoy con las víctimas que ya no callarán». Las otras dos demandantes son la actriz Esmé Bianco y una antigua asistente del artista, Ashley Walters. Ésta última asegura que mientras trabajaba para él, le puso varias veces un vídeo de él abusando de una 'joven fan' menor de edad, a la que desnudaba y azotaba hasta hacerla llorar. En otro episodio violento, Walters se escondió de Warner en un armario, y éste derribó la puerta y la amenazó asegurando tener contactos de mafiosos que cometían asesinatos a sueldo. La demandante también asegura que él buscaba información en su ordenador para chantajearla, y que incluso le pirateó la cuenta de Facebook. Además, presuntamente se jactó ante ella de haber violado a mujeres impunemente.
El cantante, que fue despedido de su compañía discográfica Loma Vista Recordings tras salir a la luz estas acusaciones, también tenía una orden de arresto por atacar a una fotógrafa en un concierto de 2019. Tras llegar a un acuerdo con la policía para entregarse este verano, fue liberado bajo fianza.",2021-11-17T16:43:08Z,https://www.abc.es,ABC
Magasin: Holdt kvinner innesperret i glassbur,"GOD KVELD NORGE (TV 2): I en stor dybderapport fra Rolling Stone Magazine kommer det ny, grusom informasjon i saken mot Marilyn Manson.
Rolling Stone Magazine beskriver i en lengre artikkel basert på rettsdokumenter og mer enn 55 nye intervjuer, hvordan Manson i flere år skal ha utnyttet og torturert kvinner.
I 2010 skal Manson ha leid en leilighet i West Hollywood, hvor en tidligere leietaker hadde bygd et lite studio av glass i hjørnet av et av rommene. Den eneste innredningen rommet hadde da Manson tok over, var skumgummi for å sørge for at det var helt lydtett.
«Bad Girls Room»
Iføle Rolling Stone omgjorde Manson, som egentlig heter Brian Warner, dette til et såkalt «Bad Girls Room». Tidligere ekskjærester og kollegaer omtaler nå dette rommet som en isolasjonscelle som ble brukt til psykisk terror av kvinnene i Mansons liv.
Videre forteller magasinet at han ofte forlot kvinnene i rommet, hvor de ble innesperret i flere timer for å straffe de for hver minste lille overtredelse.
Ifølge en tidligere assistent av Manson, Ashley Walters, elsket han å fortelle andre om dette rommet i en spøkefull tone.
Walters er en av flere kvinner som tidligere i år har stått frem med sin historie og saksøkt artisten for blant annet seksuelle overgrep, psykisk terror og frihetsberøvelse.
Leilighet dekorert med blod, hakekors og porno
Basert på vitneutsagn var Mansons leilighet dekorert med blod, hakekors og utklipte bilder fra pornoblader. Flere av de hevder at han hadde en spraymalt tekst ovenfor sengen hvor det sto «AIDS».

Alt av innredning var svart, inkludert gardinene som hang foran vinduene døgnet rundt for å blokkere ut dagslys. Temperaturen var konstant under 18 grader celsius. Om noen forsøkte å skru opp termostaten skal Manson ha fått raserianfall og begynt å kaste møbler rundt i leiligheten.
Ryan Brown, som også har jobbet som assistent for Manson, nekter for å ha sett noen kvinner innesperret i det såkalte «Bad Girls Room» i løpet av de åtte årene han jobbet for han. Likevel forteller han at det var et allment kjent kallenavn som alle brukte i forbindelse med det lille studioet.
Også den amerikanske artisten Phoebe Bridgers kjenner seg igjen i anklagene. I en tweet publisert 4. februar 2021 forteller hun at hun som tenåringsjente ble invitert til Mansons hus sammen med noen venner. Her skal han ha referert til et rom i huset som «voldtektsrommet».
Bridgers trodde dette var en del av det hun beskriver som hans fryktelige «frat boy-humor», som kanskje kan sammenlignes med det norske fenomenet «guttastemning».
Videre forteller Bridgers at plateselskapet, managementet og bandet visste om overgrepene.
– Å ta avstand nå og late som om de er sjokkerte og forferdet er jævla patetisk, tvitrer indie-stjernen.
– Sjarmerende og snill fyr
Etter at hans tidligere partner Evan Rachel Wood, kjent fra serien «Westworld», sto frem med sin historie i en Instagram-post i februar, begynte ballen å rulle.
– I begynnelsen var han en sjarmerende og snill fyr som jeg aldri hadde trodd ville skade meg, skrev Woods til generalforsamlingen i Connecticut som handlet om psykisk og fysisk vold, før hun sto frem offentlig. I dette brevet var ikke gjerningsmannen navngitt.
Videre forteller hun at forholdet deres gikk fort fremover, og at han kalte henne for hans sjelevenn og foreslo at de burde flytte sammen like etter de hadde begynt å date.
I løpet av et år hadde Manson og Woods slått opp for første gang. Ifølge Rolling Stone inspirerte bruddet han til å skrive sangen «I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies», som ble utgitt i 2009.
Fire søksmål
Til sammen gikk over et dusin kvinner ut offentlig med anklagelser mot Manson. Artisten står nå overfor fire søksmål som alle omhandler seksuelle overgrep.
Uken etter at Wood fortalte sin historie, kom også Game of Thrones-skuespilleren Esmé Bianco med påstander som innebar seksuelle overgrep, fysisk vold og menneskehandel. Bianco gikk til søksmål i april.
I mai kom Ashley Walters med et søksmål som omhandlet både seksuelle overgrep og seksuell trakassering.
Det siste søksmålet ble gjort av modellen Ashley Morgan Smithline, som også saksøker på bakgrunn av seksuelle overgrep, i tillegg til frihetsberøvelse.
Esmé Bianco hevder at mot slutten av deres to år lange forhold skal Manson ha jaget henne rundt i leiligheten med en øks. Foto: ANGELA WEISS
Et par uker etter Walters og Smithline kom enda et søksmål. I rettsdokumentene identifiseres anklageren kun som en musiker under navnet «Jane Doe».
Musikeren hevder, i tillegg til seksuelle overgrep, å ha blitt utsatt for ytterligere nedverdigende handlinger inkludert seksuell utnyttelse, manipulasjon og psykisk misbruk.
Dommeren avviste søksmålet til den ukjente kvinnen, men lot henne sende inn en endret klage. Saken er for øyeblikket under behandling.
Manson har holdt en lav profil de siste månedene, men i august dukket han overraskende nok opp på Kanye Wests lyttefest i Chicago. I helsvart bekledning gikk han rundt i en replika av Wests hus, nikkende til musikken fra albumet «Donda».",2021-11-17T16:09:37Z,https://www.tv2.no,TV 2
"Marilyn Manson habría encerrado a mujeres en una pequeña celda de vidrio para maltratarlas psicológicamente, según una investigación","Marilyn Manson habría encerrado a mujeres en una pequeña celda de vidrio para maltratarlas psicológicamente, según una investigación
El cantante se enfrenta actualmente a varias demandas de sus exparejas, que lo acusan de violación, trata de personas y reclusión ilegal.
El cantante y compositor estadounidense Marilyn Manson —nacido Brian Hugh Warner— tenía un pequeño recinto de vidrio en su apartamento de West Hollywood, donde supuestamente encerraba a las mujeres con las que estaba saliendo, revela una investigación publicada el pasado domingo por la revista Rolling Stone.
El informe se basa en más de 55 entrevistas con personas que han conocido a Manson. Según la información, el cantante llamaba a este espacio 'La habitación de las chicas malas'. La había construido un inquilino anterior del apartamento con la función original de cabina de grabación, pero fue rediseñada una vez Manson se mudó a la residencia.
Varias mujeres que salieron con Manson afirmaron que el espacio era ""una celda de confinamiento solitario utilizada para torturar psicológicamente"". Un exasistente del cantante dio a conocer que Mason disfrutaba contando a otros sobre la jaula de vidrio. Fue allí donde Warner cometió repetidos actos de maltrato mental, físico y sexual que las dejaron con episodios paralizantes de ansiedad, depresión, ataques de pánico y trastorno de estrés postraumático, según la investigación.
Una de las exparejas de Manson, Ashley Morgan Smithline, que actualmente lo demanda por agresión sexual y reclusión ilegal, aseguró que el cantante la obligó a permanecer en la 'habitación de las chicas malas', a veces durante horas. ""Al principio hizo que sonara genial, luego hizo que sonara muy punitivo. Aunque hubiera gritado nadie me habría oído, [...] primero peleas y él lo disfruta. Aprendí a no pelear, porque eso era lo que él quería"", señaló Smithline.
Manson se enfrenta actualmente a varias demandas de exparejas que lo acusan de violación, trata de personas y reclusión ilegal. A parte de Ashley Morgan Smithline, su exasistente personal Ashley Walters y la actriz Esmé Bianco dirigieron acciones legales en contra del cantante. En septiembre de 2021 un juez estadounidense desestimó una demanda por agresión sexual presentada contra Manson por una mujer que permaneció bajo anonimato.",2021-11-17T10:58:48Z,https://actualidad.rt.com,RT en Español
Marilyn Manson: Sperrte er Frauen ein?,"Die ‘Westworld‘-Darstellerin Evan Rachel Wood machte am 1.

Nachdem sich immer mehr Frauen meldeten und ähnlich schwere Vorwürfe auspackten, wurde dann der Prozess gegen den Musiker eröffnet. Doch jetzt sind weitere grauenhafte Details bekannt geworden: So soll Manson Frauen regelmäßig über mehrere Stunden in eine schalldichte Kammer gesperrt haben. So habe er laut eines Berichts des ‘Rolling Stone‘ eine Zimmerecke mit Schaumstoff ausgekleidet und das Zimmer „Raum der bösen Mädchen“ genannt haben. Eines der Opfer, Ashley Walter, erklärte: „Er erwähnte diesen Raum stets in einem scherzhaften, prahlenden Ton.“ So hätten die Frauen stundenlang dort ausgeharrt und ihre „Strafe“ dort absitzen müssen.",2021-11-17T07:30:10Z,https://www.vip.de,"VIP.de, Star News"

Sarah McNeilly est la dernière femme en date à accuser Marilyn Manson d’abus sexuels. La mannequin a révélé les sévices auxquels l’aurait soumis le chanteur au cours de leur relation. Le rockeur fait face à de nombreuses allégations d’inconduite sexuelle et ce qu’a décrit la jeune femme à «Rolling Stone», qui a publié une enquête, semble confirmer les précédentes accusations.
«Il se surpasse pour essayer de vous convaincre de lui faire confiance. Il semblait très vulnérable. Mais il apprenait aussi à me connaître, à savoir ce qui me faisait tiquer et où il pouvait tirer les ficelles plus tard», a-t-elle expliqué, avant d’ajouter qu’elle s’est rendu compte que quelque chose ne tournait pas rond quand l’artiste lui a dit qu’il l’aimait une semaine seulement après le début de leur relation. «Je me suis arrêtée et je me suis dit: «Mais qu'est-ce que tu viens de me dire? Ça fait une semaine qu’on sort ensemble.» Il voulait que je commence à choisir des robes de mariée. Il voulait avoir un bébé. Je n’ai jamais vécu une relation comme ça», a-t-elle confié.

Nuove accuse contro Marilyn Manson: rinchiudeva le sue donne in una stanza delle torture insonorizzata,"Dopo nove mesi di indagini, Rolling Stone Usa ha pubblicato un'inchiesta giornalistica sugli abusi sessuali, fisici e psicologici imputati a Brian Warner, ovvero Marilyn Manson . La rivista statunitense ha ascoltato 55 persone che hanno avuto a che fare con il rocker e tra i dettagli venuti alla luce c'è il racconto di molte donne che hanno parlato una piccola stanzetta insonorizzata con pareti di vetro nella quale Manson rinchiudeva le partner che frequentava per torturarle psicologicamente, la Bad Girls' Room.

L'ex assistente di Manson, Ashley Walters, che lo ha citato in giudizio per violenza sessuale e percosse, ha affermato che il cantante di ""Beautiful People"" ha ""sempre scherzato e si è vantato della stanza"". Un altro ex assistente, Ryan Brown, ha negato di aver mai visto donne confinate nella stanza, ma ha detto alla rivista: ""Era risaputo che era così che la chiamavano tutti"". Manson aveva confermato l'esistenza della stanza, affermando in un'intervista a una rivista nel 2012: ""Se qualcuno è cattivo, posso chiuderlo a chiave in un posto insonorizzato"".
L'ex fidanzata Ashley Morgan Smithline, che ha accusato il rocker di averla violentata e abusata durante la loro relazione di due anni, ha affermato di essere una delle donne costrette a rimanere nella stanza. ""All'inizio, lo faceva sembrare divertente. ma poi lui l’ha reso molto punitivo. Anche se avessi urlato nessuno mi avrebbe sentito"", ha detto la modella a Rolling Stone. Smithline ha detto che lo spazio aveva le dimensioni di un camerino di un grande magazzino e ha anche spiegato che se avesse combattuto Manson per entrare nella stanza, lui si sarebbe ""divertito di più"" così ""ho imparato a non combatterlo, perché questo gli dava piacere e allora mi sono come estraniata da quel contesto con la testa"".
Dall'inizio di quest'anno, almeno 15 donne, tra cui l'attrice di ""Game of Thrones"" Esmé Bianco, hanno accusato il cantante di ""Personal Jesus"" di vari livelli di abusi sessuali, psicologici e fisici. Sebbene il suo caso contro Jane Does sia stato archiviato a settembre, un giudice ha deciso a ottobre di continuare il procedimento con il caso della Bianco. Manson ha negato tutte le accuse. Il suo avvocato, Howard King, ha dichiarato a Page Six ad aprile che le affermazioni di Bianco ""sono dimostrabilmente false"". Manson ha nuovamente negato le affermazioni in una dichiarazione a Rolling Stone dopo l'uscita dell'inchiesta.

Revista ""Rolling Stone"" investigou durante nove meses alegações de abuso sexual, físico e psicológico contra o cantor de rock chocante. E confirmou: ""Manson é o monstro que se esconde à vista de todos"". O artista já foi acusado judicialmente por mais de uma dezena de mulheres. Eis as 10 principais conclusões da extensa investigação.
1: Padrão de alegados maus tratos a mulheres é anterior à fama
Na sua primeira capa na Rolling Stone, em 1997, Marilyn Manson, nome artístico de Brian Warner, de 52 anos, norte-americano, descreveu o seu relacionamento coma mãe como ""estranho, porque era meio abusivo, mas da minha parte"". O cantor rock escreveu nas suas memórias que uma vez a agrediu com um frasco de perfume, deixando-a com uma cicatriz, quando pensou que ela tinha traído o seu pai.
Tim Vaughn, que diz ter sido amigo de Manson nos anos 1990, lembra-se do artista a insultar a mãe e a gritar com ela com frequência. Uma vez, recorda Vaughn, ""ele perseguiu-a pelo corredor com um pé de microfone em riste. Eu perguntei-lhe: 'Que diabo se passa contigo?!' Ele disse, 'a vaca está sempre a entrar aqui nos piores momentos'.
Na sua biografia, Manson escreveu sobre abusar de uma mulher a que ele chamou ""Nancy"" como parte do seu espetáculo no início da carreira. O cantor segurava-a por uma trela e espancava-a no palco -- ""para denunciar a nossa sociedade patriarcal, é claro, não porque gostasse de arrastar uma mulher seminua pelo palco"", escreveu o artista. Manson também afirmou no livro que ele e um colega de banda planearam matar Nancy, mas depois mudaram de ideias.
2: Alegados abusos sexuais já virão desde os anos 1990
Três pessoas que se dizem amigas de Marilyn Manson no início dos anos 1990 afirmam que ele lhes mostrou encontros sexuais que tinha gravado numa câmara de vídeo. Russell Vaughn lembra-se de sair uma noite com o seu irmão Tim Vaughn, uma amiga, e Manson. ""Ele mostrou-nos uma compilação de todas as raparigas que já lhe tinham feito felácios"", diz ele. ""E estava muito orgulhoso disso"". Os irmãos Vaughn e a amiga, que pediu para permanecer anónima, confirmam à ""Rolling Stone"" ter visto os vídeos.

3: Violações são fonte frequente de humor negro há décadas
Antigos amigos dizem que as piadas frequentes das violações de Marilyn Manson começaram muito cedo na sua vida e não diminuíram. Nas suas memórias de 1998, Manson detalha uma ""partida"" que pregou a Jeordie White, ex-membro da sua banda. Disse-lhe: ""Vamos violar-te no parque de estacionamento e depois vamos esmagar-te debaixo do teu próprio carro"".
Num espetáculo de 2009, O cantor disse à multidão: ""Quando te ris depois de fazer sexo com ela, não é violação"". Uma fonte ouvida pela ""Rolling Stone"" disse: ""Ele costumava brincar com as violações o tempo todo"". Esmé Bianco, estrela da série ""A guerra dos tronos"" e antiga namorada de Manson corrobora: ""Ele adorava a ideia da violação, falar de violações. Vê-las nos filmes, adorava"". Acrescenta Bianco: ""Antes mesmo de eu ter namorado com ele, ele falou em violar-me"".
4: Manson parece deleitar-se em dizer a palavra ""preto""
Muitas fontes afirmaram à ""Rolling Stone"" que Manson ""usa frequentemente"" a palavra ""preto"" para se referir a uma pessoa negra. ""Ele diz isso muitas vezes. Parece mesmo deleitar-se em ser capaz de dizer a palavra em frente de pessoas negras"".
5: Artista tem fixação bizarra com o nazismo
Os fãs do cantor já sabiam que Marilyn Manson tinha uma predileção pelo imaginário totalitário do nazismo. Basta ver o seu logótipo em forma de raio, que faz lembrar as insígnias das SS, ou o sinistro porteiro noturno chique do seu disco ""Golden age of grotesque"". Mas agora há fontes a alegar que o seu interesse na ideologia de Adolf Hitler é mais fundo do que parece.
Esmé Bianco, diz que Manson a ""espancou com um chicote nazi"", um utensílio que ""ele gostava de exibir aos seus amigos judeus"". Também a ex-namorada Ashley Morgan Smithline, que está a processá-lo por abusos sexuais, diz que Manson ""exigia"" que ela ""comprasse o máximo de souvenirs nazis que conseguisse encontrar"".
A ""Rolling Stone já tinha relatado em 2015 que o artista tem em casa uma lata não utilizada de Zyklon B, o gás letal que os nazis usavam para matar judeus durante o Holocausto.
O artista nega as alegações das duas acusadoras, fala em ""relatos fabricados"" e, num processo legal, diz tratar-se ""de um ataque coordenado"" no qual as duas mulheres ""estão a tentar desesperadamente fundir as imagens e a arte da personagem de palco de 'rocker de choque' com a minha persona particular"".
6: Agrediu funcionários seus e membros da banda
Ex-associados de Manson sustentam que ele pode ser abusivo para com os seus empregados. Várias pessoas ouvidas pela ""Rolling Stone"" dizem que Manson ""era um mestre em técnicas de controle mental praticadas por líderes de cultos, e que pedia aos empregados, namoradas e ""groupies"" que se chibassem uns aos outros e lhe relatassem o que diziam de mal sobre ele. ""Era um ambiente em que não se podia confiar em ninguém"", disse uma fonte à revista.
Um showcase da sua editora em 1996 transformou-se em violência quando Manson atirou um microfone ao baterista Kenneth Wilson, mandando-o para o hospital. ""Eu estou a tocar bateria e a tentar ler a mente de Manson"", relatou o baterista. ""Se eu falhar uma nota, posso levar com um pé de microfone na cabeça"".
Os representantes de Manson não quiseram comentar a agressão mas disseram: ""É importante notar que esses eventos em questão aconteceram no palco durante um espetáculo de rock"".
Manson também atacou o baixista Fred Sablan e arremessou um pesado pé de microfone à bateria de Jason Sutter. Uma vez em 2012, em Las Vegas, houve um incidente com um espelho durante uma tournée. ""O adereço não funcionou como ele queria e Manson tentou parti-lo, atingindo o diretor de palco, que teve teve de ser assistido no hospital"", revelou uma fonte.
7. A cela de torturas para meninas más
Ex-namoradas alegam que Marilyn Manson converteu uma cabina de som do seu apartamento em West Hollywood, na Califórnia, EUA, numa ""cela para meninas más"", que usava para torturas físicas e psicológicas. Dizem que Manson fechava frequentemente as namoradas na cela de vidro, à prova de som, mantendo-as em confinamento forçado horas a fio.
A atriz Ashley Morgan Smithline disse à ""Rolling Stone"" que o artista a forçou repetidamente àquela prisão, que era do tamanho de um roupeiro. ""A princípio, ele até fazia de conta que aquilo era ""cool"""", diz Smithline, ""mas depois ele explicitava que era uma punição. Mesmo se eu gritasse, ninguém me ouviria"". Relata Ashley Morgan Smithline: ""Primeiro tu lutas, e ele gosta da luta. Aprendi a não lutar contra a vontade dele, porque isso era dar-lhe o que ele queria. Eu simplesmente evadia-me dentro da minha cabeça"".
O artista diz que as acusações da ex-namorada são ""simplesmente mentiras"".
8: Relacionamentos começavam com ""bombardeamentos de amor""
Quase todas as mulheres que apresentaram acusações de abuso contra Marilyn Manson descreveram um começo de relação alegre, repleto de elogios e gestos amorosos. É uma tática que a ex-namorada Esmé Bianco caracteriza como ""bombardeamentos de amor"" - tratar alguém demasiadamente bem no início da relação, preparando assim o caminho para o abuso posterior. ""Fiquei lisonjeada"", disse Bianco. ""Literalmente, as primeiras palavras que ele me disse foram ""sou teu fã há anos"". Agora olho para trás e sei que era só treta"".
A modelo Sarah McNeilly, outra mulher que acusa o artista de abusos, relatou que Manson lhe disse que a amava uma semana depois que se conheceram. ""Ele queria que eu começasse a escolher vestidos de noiva"", diz McNeilly. ""Ele queria ter um filho. Eu nunca tive um relacionamento assim, uma merda muito falsa"", diz.
Falando da própria experiência pessoal, o guitarrista Rob Holliday insiste que Marilyn Manson sempre foi ""um cavalheiro fora do palco"", e que ele é apenas ""um pária doce e incompreendido"".
9: Manson é acusado de múltiplas agressões sexuais e abusos físicos
Várias mulheres -dez, pelos menos - detalham alegações horríveis contra Manson em entrevistas e registos judiciais consultados ​​pela ""Rolling Stone"". No seu processo, Smithline alega que o cantor a sufocou, estrangulou, mordeu, gravou as iniciais ""MM"" na sua coxa, queimou-a sem consentimento ""para [sua] gratificação sexual"" e que a violou ""várias vezes"".
Bianco alega no seu processo que o relacionamento deles ""incluía um padrão de pesadelo de drogas, abusos físicos e agressão sexual"".
Neilly diz à ""Rolling Stone"": ""Manson atirou-me contra a parede, ele tinha um taco de beisebol na mão, e disse que me ia partir a cara toda"".
O processo da ex-assistente Ashley Walters alega que Manson ""queria que eu me oferecesse aos seus amigos"", encorajando-a a ""agradar-lhes da forma que eles desejassem"".
Uma mulher anónima que processou Manson afirma que o artista a atirou ao chão e violou. ""Ele dizia que eu o deixava louco e que o obrigava a fazer o que fazia"", diz o processo. ""Depois dos atos violentos, ele dizia-me: 'Nunca mais me obrigues a fazer-te isto"". Após o suposto ataque, Manson terá ameaçado matá-la, dizendo que ia ""meter-me a cabeça para dentro "", e gabou-se de que poderia ""escapar impune"" do homicídio ""porque eu não era ninguém e ele era uma celebridade que tinha contactos com a polícia"".
Manson, através do seu advogado, negou as ""sinistras"" e ""fictícias alegações"". Diz a declaração: ""Essas reivindicações sinistras contra o meu cliente têm três coisas em comum: são todas falsas, supostamente ocorreram há mais de uma década e são parte de um ataque coordenado por ex-sócios e associados do meu cliente que transformaram os detalhes mundanos da sua vida pessoal e dos seus relacionamentos consensuais em histórias de terror fabricadas"".
10: As acusadoras reuniram-se em 2020 para partilhar alegações
Em outubro de 2020, algumas das acusadoras, incluindo Walters, Smithline, Bianco e a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, encontraram-se em Los Angeles. O grupo partilhava um vínculo relutante: todas diziam ter sido abusadas por Manson.
O corpo de Bianco tremeu e os seus olhos lacrimejaram quando ela relatou ao grupo um episódio de Manson a persegui-la pelo apartamento com um machado e a abrir buracos nas paredes, acusando-a de o ""apequenar"".
Walters ficou pasma ao ouvir algumas das histórias. ""Eu só pensei: ""Não é possível que isso tenha acontecido com tantas raparigas"""", diz ela. ""Assim que começamos a conversar, via-se que todas empalidecíamos, eu pensava que era a única"""".
Aproximadamente três meses depois, Evan Rachel Wood acusou Marilyn Manson de abuso, e expôs o seu nome - anos antes, a atriz de ""Westworld"" tinha dado o seu testemunho a um Comité Judicial da Califórnia num caso de violência doméstica, mas não revelou o nome do seu agressor.
""Ele começou a preparar-me quando eu era adolescente e abusou terrivelmente de mim durante anos. O nome do meu agressor é Brian Warner, também conhecido mundialmente como Marilyn Manson"", escreveu Rachel Wood no Instagram. ""Estou aqui para expor este homem perigoso e convocar as muitas indústrias que o capacitaram, antes que ele destrua mais vidas"".

Marilyn Manson é acusado de torturar ex-namoradas em ‘cela de vidro’,"Grosby Group
A situação de Marilyn Manson está cada vez pior. O cantor é acusado por abuso sexual e psicológico há alguns anos, mas sempre surge alguma novidade com relação ao assunto e normalmente é algo assustador.
Desta vez, segundo reportagem da revista Rolling Stone, ex-namoradas que tiveram relacionamentos com o músico, além de colegas de trabalho relataram que eram “presas” em uma “cela de vidro” sempre que faziam algo que o desagradasse. O apelido do loca, inclusive, era “quarto das meninas más”.
A ex-namorada Ashley Morgan Smithline, que é uma das que processa Manson de agressão sexual e cárcere privado, deu detalhes do local. Ela o comparou a um “provador de loja à prova de som.
“Mesmo que gritasse, ninguém podia me ouvir. Você lutava e ele gostava dessa reação. Aprendi a não lutar, porque isso dava a ele o que ele queria”.
Um ex-assistente de Manson contou que o músico tinha “orgulho” do local. “Ele sempre tinha um tom de brincadeira e se gabando”.
Acusações antigas
Vale lembrar que Marilyn Manson tem problemas com a Justiça por conta de abusos sexuais há algum tempo. Mais de dez mulheres fizeram denúncias, entre elas as atrizes Evan Rachel Wood, de Westworld, Esmé Bianco, de Game of thrones, Bianca Allaine, e a cantora Ellie Rowsell.
O relato mais recente aconteceu este ano, em fevereiro, feito por Evan Rachel Wood, onde ela revelou ter “cansado de viver com medo da retaliação”.
Esmé Bianco contou que foi submetida a “choques, mordidas, xingamentos e estupros” durante o relacionamento, que durou de 2009 a 2013, além de ter sido perseguida com um machado pelo cantor no apartamento dele.
Marilyn Manson, por sua vez, contou que, apesar de tudo, todos os relacionamentos eram consensuais e que tudo está sendo deturpado para acusá-lo injustamente.
“Meus relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram inteiramente consensuais com parceiros que pensam como eu. Independentemente de como – e por que – os outros agora estão optando por deturpar o passado, essa é a verdade”.

Marilyn Manson soll Frauen in schalldichten Raum gesperrt haben,"Immer mehr Vorwürfe gegen Marilyn Manson kommen ans Licht. Nun wurde enthüllt, dass der Schock-Rocker in seiner Wohnung eine Zelle genutzt habe, um seine Partnerinnen zu quälen.

7/8 Das «Rolling Stone»-Magazin schreibt, dass Manson ein «Monster im Rampenlicht» sei.
8/8 Die Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood trat die Welle der Vorwürfe an Manson los.
Marilyn Manson (52) soll nicht nur auf der Bühne ein Monster sein, sondern auch im echten Leben. Das behaupten zahlreiche Frauen, die dem Musiker vorwerfen sie sexuell, psychisch und physisch missbraucht zu haben. «Rolling Stone» hat sich nun tiefer mit dem Fall befasst und dafür unter anderem über 55 Interviews im Umfeld von Manson geführt.
Dabei will das Musik-Magazin herausgefunden haben, dass der Schock-Rocker seine gewalttätige Seite «für alle gut sichtbar» versteckt habe. Er habe in der Öffentlichkeit und seinem Bekanntenkreis nie ein grosses Geheimnis darüber gemacht, dass er Frauen quäle. Durch seine Horror-Persona sollen seine Aussagen aber nie ernst genommen worden sein.
Wegen Missbrauchsvorwürfen: Marilyn Manson verliert Plattenvertrag ( 01:01 )
«Es war eine Bestrafung»
Ein Beispiel, das in dem Text genannt wird: Mansons «Bad Girls Room» (Englisch für «Raum der bösen Mädchen»). In seiner alten Wohnung in West Hollywood, Los Angeles soll sich eine schalldichte Glas-Zelle befunden haben, der von seinem vorherigen Mieter zur Musikproduktion verwendet wurde. Manson soll darin aber Frauen für die «kleinsten Vergehen» eingesperrt haben, wie zwei seiner Ex-Freundinnen erzählen.
«Es war eine Bestrafung», erzählt etwa das Model Ashley Morgan Smithline. «Niemand hört dich darin schreien.» Manson habe es genossen, durch die Glasscheiben des Raumes zu beobachten, wie sie in Panik verfiel. «Irgendwann lernte ich, mich nicht mehr zu wehren, weil das war, was er wollte.» Laut Ashley Walters, Mansons ehemaliger Assistentin und mutmasslichem Opfer, habe Manson seinem Umfeld gerne erzählt, dass er sie in den «Bad Girls Room» sperre: «Er machte Witze darüber und prahlte sogar damit.» Mehrere Mitglieder von Mansons Entourage bestätigten, dass der «Bad Girls Room» so genannt wurde. Sogar in einem Interview im Jahr 2012 gab Manson an: «Wenn jemand sich nicht benimmt, sperre ich ihn darin ein. Er ist schalldicht.»
Wohnung war als «schwarzer Kühlschrank» bekannt
Auch ansonsten habe die Wohnung einem Horrorfilm-Set geglichen. Die Wände seien vollkommen schwarz gestrichen und vereinzelt mit «Blut verziert» gewesen. Über seinem Bett habe Manson in grossen Buchstaben das Wort Aids hingesprüht. Dicke Vorhänge sollen verhindert haben, dass jemals Tageslicht ins Innere gelangt. Die Wohnung sei ausserdem immer auf 18 Grad gekühlt gewesen. Wenn jemand die Klimaanlage wärmer drehte, habe Manson mit Wutausbrüchen reagiert. Bei seinen Ex-Freundinnen sei das Apartment als «schwarzer Kühlschrank» bekannt gewesen.",2021-11-16T18:33:59Z,https://www.blick.ch,BLICK.CH

In den vergangenen Monaten häuften sich die Negativ-Schlagzeilen um den Skandal-Rocker. Der Grund: Mehrere Frauen, darunter ""Game Of Thrones""-Star Esmé Bianco (39), Model Ashley Smithline (36) und Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (34), meldeten sich mit grauenhaften Missbrauchsvorwürfen zu Wort.
Wie The Rolling Stone berichtet, kamen nun weitere, schlimme Details ans Licht. Der Musiker soll seine Freundinnen nicht nur sexuell missbraucht, sondern sie auch immer wieder in einem kleinen und schalldichten Raum in seinem Apartment in Los Angeles eingesperrt haben.
Immer dann, wenn sich die Frauen angeblich schlecht benommen hatten, mussten sie stundenlang dort ausharren, schreibt das US-amerikanische Musikmagazin weiter.
Lautes Geschrei oder Hilferufe gingen durch den mit Schaumstoff ausgekleideten Raum, der den Namen ""Bad Girls Room"" trug, völlig unter.
Mansons Opfer berichteten bereits von einem solchen Raum, wie beispielsweise Ashley Smithline. Im Mai dieses Jahres verriet sie dem People Magazine, dass der Sänger das Model in den Raum einsperrte, wenn es ihn ""verärgert"" habe.",2021-11-16T17:25:00Z,https://www.tag24.de,TAG24
"Marilyn Manson prendia e torturava mulheres em cela de vidro, afirmam testemunhas","Alvo de uma série de processos por abuso sexual e agressões psicológicas e físicas, o roqueiro Marilyn Manson está sendo agora acusado de prender ex-namoradas em uma apertada cabine de vidro à prova de som em seu apartamento em West Hollywood. Segundo a revista americana Rolling Stone, mulheres que tiveram relacionamentos com o músico e antigas colegas de trabalho relataram terem sido enclausuradas na caixa durante horas repetidas vezes por Brian Warner — nome verdadeiro do músico — como forma de punição. Apelidado pelo próprio cantor como ""quarto das meninas más"", o espaço era destinado às mulheres que fizessem algo que o desagradasse.

Ashley Walters, uma ex-assistente que também abriu processo na Justiça, destacou que o roqueiro gostava de contar às pessoas sobre o local: ""ele sempre tinha um tom de brincadeira e se gabando”. Ele chegou a falar sobre a cela em entrevista a uma revista em 2012, quando afirmou que ""se alguém fosse ruim, poderia prendê-la lá dentro"".
A modelo Sarah McNeilly, que teve um relacionamento com o músico, relatou que a experiência na caixa de vidro foi ""absolutamente assustadora"" e revelou ainda que, em 2011, Manson ameaçou ""amassar"" sua cara com um taco de beisebol.
A reportagem da revista americana acontece após uma série de denúncias feitas por mais de dez mulheres, incluindo as atrizes Evan Rachel Wood (""Westworld""), Esmé Bianco (“Game of thrones”) e Bianca Allaine, todas ex-namoradas de Warner, além da cantora Ellie Rowsell.
Em fevereiro deste ano, Wood revelou ter sido vítima de estupro e agressões durante anos, encorajando outras mulheres a falarem sobre os abusos. ""Cansei de viver com medo de retaliação, calúnia ou chantagem. Estou aqui para expor este homem perigoso"", ela escreveu em um comunicado.
Em resposta, Manson afirmou que as alegações eram ""horríveis distorções da realidade"". ""Meus relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram inteiramente consensuais com parceiros que pensam como eu. Independentemente de como - e por que - os outros agora estão optando por deturpar o passado, essa é a verdade"", escreveu no Instagram.

A atriz contou ainda à revista Rolling Stone que o músico chegou a persegui-la pelo apartamento com um machado, abrindo buracos nas paredes. “Foi um momento decisivo para mim”, disse Bianco, que afirmou ainda que se sentiu ""em perigo iminente de vida"" e que partir foi sua melhor tentativa de sobreviver.

Marilyn Manson soll eine Folterzelle für Frauen gehabt haben,"Der ""Rolling Stone"" hat Vorwürfe gegen Schockmusiker Marilyn Manson gesammelt und dafür mit 55 beteiligten Menschen gesprochen. Was sie enthüllen, ist schockierend.
""Das Monster das sich für alle sichtbar versteckt"" – die Überschrift einer neuen ""Rolling Stone""-Reportage hat es bereits in sich.
Das Musikmagazin hat neue, schwerwiegende Vorwürfe gegen Schockmusiker Marilyn Manson gesammelt. Dafür haben die Journalisten Gerichtsakten untersucht und insgesamt mit 55 beteiligten Menschen gesprochen. Und was sie enthüllen, ist schockierend.
Marilyn Manson: Angebliche Folterzelle in seiner Wohnung
So soll Manson eine Aufnahmekabine in seinem Apartment in eine Folterzelle für Frauen umgewandelt haben. Mehrere Zeugen haben dem ""Rolling Stone"" berichtet, er habe die Frauen dort über Stunden eingesperrt und sie für vermeintliche Fehler bestraft. Die Zelle nannte er angeblich den ""Raum der bösen Mädchen"". Ganz überraschend kommt die Information allerdings nicht, immerhin hatte Manson bereits in Interviews erzählt, dass er einen ""schalldichten"" Raum habe, in den er Menschen einsperren könnte.
Eine der Frauen, die Manson so erlebt hat und mit dem Magazin sprach, sagte: ""Zuerst ließ er es cool klingen. Dann ließ er es sehr strafend klingen. Selbst wenn ich schrie, würde mich niemand hören. Zuerst kämpft man, und er genießt den Kampf. Ich lernte, mich nicht zu wehren, denn damit gab ich ihm, was er wollte. Ich war in meinem Kopf einfach ganz woanders."" Seine Wohnung, die eine andere Freundin als ""schwarzen Kühlschrank"" bezeichnete, soll mit Pornobildchen, Hakenkreuzen und Blut dekoriert gewesen sein.
Evan Rachel Wood wirft ihm Gewalt vor
Auch ""Game of Thrones""-Darstellerin Esmé Bianco behauptet, Manson habe sie missbraucht. Laut ""Rolling Stone"" soll er ihr Essen vorenthalten, sie gebissen, ausgepeitscht mit Stromschlägen malträtiert und sogar vergewaltigt haben. In einer Nacht habe er sie mit einer Axt bewaffnet durch seine Wohnung gejagt.
Im Oktober vergangenen Jahres setzten sich einige von Mansons Ex-Freundinnen und Geliebten zusammen und sprachen über ihre Erlebnisse. Dabei war auch Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood, die erst im Februar dieses Jahres den Namen ihres Peinigers genannt hatte. Vorher hatte sie darüber geschwiegen. Sie wolle nicht mehr ""in Angst vor Vergeltung, Verleumdung oder Erpressung"" leben, schrieb sie damals und gab so anderen Frauen den Mut, ihre Stimmen gegen Manson zu erheben.
Seinen Anwälten zufolge bestreitet Manson ""vehement jegliche Behauptung eines sexuellen Übergriffs oder Missbrauchs von Personen"". Mehrere Frauen haben ihn mittlerweile angeklagt.

Ο Marilyn Manson, του οποίου το πραγματικό όνομα είναι Brian Warner, έγινε γνωστός τη δεκαετία του 1990 λόγω της εκκεντρικής του προσωπικότητας και από τις μεγάλες επιτυχίες των τραγουδιών του. Τα Μέσα μαζικής ενημέρωσης τον θεωρούσαν απλώς «προκλητικό» και «διαφορετικό». Εκτός σκηνής όμως βάσει των αποκαλύψεων που έχουν γίνει γύρω από το όνομά του ήταν ένας βιαστής, που μετέτρεπε σε κόλαση τη ζωή των γυναικών.
Ήταν ένα τέρας, όπως τον χαρακτηρίζει το περιοδικό «Rolling Stone», το οποίο με έρευνά του φέρνει στο φως την «κρυφή και ανώμαλη» ζωή του.
Την ώρα που όλοι τον θεωρούσαν «ροκ» εκείνος κυνηγούσε τις συντρόφους του με τσεκούρια, τις βίαζε και τις κακοποιούσε τόσο ψυχολογικά όσο και σεξουαλικά. Αρκετοί φίλοι του 52χρονου Μάνσον είπαν ότι ο τραγουδιστής τραβούσε βίντεο με τον ίδιο να κάνει στοματικό σεξ μέσα σε ντουλάπα και μάλιστα το μοιράζονταν, ενώ ένιωθε «περήφανος για αυτό».
Το διαμέρισμά του ήταν ένα κολαστήριο για εκείνες. Είχε τσεκούρια, μαστίγια και ήταν γεμάτο αίμα, σβάστικες και πορνό.
Το «Rolling Stone» λοιπόν, έκανε μία έρευνα εννέα μηνών, η οποία βασίστηκε στα κείμενα της δικογραφίας εναντίον του, σε μαρτυρίες και σε 55 συνεντεύξεις από ανθρώπους που κακοποιήθηκαν από εκείνον.
Το διαμέρισμα με τους εφιάλτες
Μία δεκαετία πριν ο Manson νοίκιασε ένα διαμέρισμα πάνω από μία κάβα στο West Hollywoo. Ο προηγούμενος ένοικος ήταν μία εταιρεία ηχογράφησης που είχε στήσει ένα δωμάτιο με ηχομόνωση για επαγγελματικά μουσικά πρότζεκτ.
Ο χώρος αυτός χρησιμοποιήθηκε από τον μουσικό για να κελί. Σε αυτόν φυλακίζονταν οι γυναίκες όταν ήταν άτακτες και έπρεπε να τιμωρηθούν. Μάλιστα, του είχε δώσει και όνομα. Λεγόταν «bad girls room».
Η Ashley Morgan Smithlin, που έχει πέσει θύμα κακοποίησης από τον Manson αποκαλύπτει ότι την κρατούσε δεμένη σε αυτό το δωμάτιο και καλλιεργούσε την ιδέα ότι πρόκειται για μία τιμωρία που της άξιζε. «Δεν είχε νόημα να παλεύεις, γιατί αυτό του άρεσε», τονίζει.
Εκτός από τον συγκεκριμένο χώρο, το υπόλοιπο διαμέρισμα του μουσικού ήταν διακοσμημένο με αίμα, σβάστικες και κομμένες φωτογραφίες από περιοδικά πορνό με γυναικεία γεννητικά όργανα.
Πάνω από το κρεβάτι του υπήρχε ένα μήνυμα με σπρέι, και τη λέξη «AIDS».
Τα χαλιά, τα έπιπλα και όλη η διακόσμηση ήταν μαύρη, όπως και οι κουρτίνες. Ήθελε να υπάρχει απόλυτο σκοτάδι όλες τις ώρες της ημέρας.
Επίσης, ήθελε η θερμοκρασία να είναι πάρα πολύ χαμηλή. Αν κάποιος τολμούσε να την ανεβάσει, γινόταν έξαλλος και έσπαγε τα έπιπλα. Μία από τις πρώην συντρόφους του χαρακτηρίζει το διαμέρισμα «μαύρο ψυγείο» και «καταψύκτη για τέρατα».
Πολλές είναι οι γυναίκες που αναφέρουν ότι τους στερούσε τον ύπνο και το φαγητό, τις βίαζε, τις δάγκωνε, τις μαστίγωνε χωρίς φυσικά τη συναίνεσή τους. Επίσης, αναφέρουν ότι τις κυνηγούσε με τσεκούρι και άνοιγε τρύπες στον τοίχο.
Τα παραπάνω επιβεβαιώνει και η Esme Bianco, η γνωστή ηθοποιός του Game of Thrones, που έζησε στο συγκεκριμένο σπίτι για δύο χρόνια. Ο Manson αρνείται κάθε κατηγορία και μέσω του δικηγόρου του επισημαίνει ότι όλες οι κοπέλες πήγαιναν εκεί με τη θέλησή τους και ότι όλα γίνονταν αφού είχαν συναινέσει.
Η Evan Rachel Wood παρέμεινε 7 μήνες αρραβωνιασμένη μαζί του
«Το όνομα του κακοποιητή μου είναι Brian Warner». Θυμίζουμε ότι η γνωστή ηθοποιός Evan Rachel Woodέχει ήδη από τον Φεβρουάριο καταγγείλει τον Marilyn Manson.
Με μία ανάρτηση στο προσωπικό της προφίλ στο Instagram αποκάλυψε ότι ήταν θύμα ψυχολογικής κακοποίησης για πολλά χρόνια από τον τραγουδιστή. Η σχέση τους έγινε γνωστή το 2007, όταν εκείνη ήταν 19 και εκείνος 38. Το 2010 αρραβωνιάστηκαν και επτά μήνες μετά χώρισαν.
Στην ανάρτησή της γράφει: «Το όνομα του κακοποιητή μου είναι Brian Warner ή όπως είναι γνωστός σε όλο τον κόσμο Marilyn Manson. Από την εφηβεία μου και για πολλά χρόνια με κακοποιούσε ψυχικά. Μου έκανε πλύση εγκεφάλου και με χειραγωγούσε κατ’ επανάληψη.
Έχω τελειώσει με το να ζω μέσα στον φόβο, στα αντίποινα, στις συκοφαντίες και τους εκβιασμούς. Είμαι εδώ για να πω για να κατονομάσω αυτόν τον επικίνδυνο άνθρωπο και για τις βιομηχανίες που του επέτρεψαν να το κάνει αυτό, προτού καταστρέψει κι άλλες ζωές. Είμαι στο πλευρό των θυμάτων που δεν θέλουν πλέον να ζουν στη σιωπή».

Vorwürfe gegen Marilyn Manson: Sperrte er Frauen in gläserne Kammer?,"Die Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen Musiker Marilyn Manson reissen nicht ab.
Für eine Medienrecherche haben sich nun Betroffene zu Wort gemeldet.

Mehrere Frauen werfen Marilyn Manson sexuellen Missbrauch vor. Die US-Ausgabe des ""Rolling Stone"" hat nun mit Betroffenen gesprochen und in Gerichtsdokumenten recherchiert. In 55 Interviews schildern die Frauen ihre Erfahrungen mit Brian Warner, so sein bürgerlicher Name. Das ""Monster in Sichtweite"", wie Manson in dem Artikel bezeichnet wird, soll unter anderem Frauen häufig in eine kleine, schalldichte Kabine in seinem Zuhause in West Hollywood gesperrt haben.
Er soll sie dorthin verbannt und sie stundenlang dort festgehalten haben, um sie für schon kleinste Fehltritte zu bestrafen. Er nannte die Kammer den ""Bad Girls' Room"" (zu Deutsch: ""Raum für böse Mädchen""). Das Glasgehäuse, das eigentlich für die Musikproduktion eingerichtet worden war, soll der Vormieter bei seinem Auszug dagelassen haben.
Marilyn Manson: Kammer soll die Grösse eine Umkleidekabine gehabt haben
Ashley Walters, eine ehemalige Assistentin, die Warner unter anderem wegen sexueller Übergriffe verklagt hatte, sagte dem ""Rolling Stone"", Manson habe es genossen, den Leuten von der Kammer zu erzählen. ""Er hatte dabei immer einen scherzhaften, prahlenden Ton“, erinnerte sie sich. Ashley Morgan Smithline berichtete davon, selbst stundenlang in der Kammer in der Grösse einer Umkleidekabine eingesperrt gewesen zu sein. ""Zuerst hat er es cool klingen lassen"", sagte Smithline. ""Dann liess er es sehr bestrafend klingen. Selbst wenn ich schrie, würde mich niemand hören. Ich lernte, nicht dagegen anzukämpfen, denn das gab ihm, was er wollte. Ich bin in meinem Kopf einfach woanders hingegangen.""
Der Rest von Warners Wohnung, in der die Frauen psychischen und physischen Missbrauch erlebt haben sollen, soll mit Blut und ausgeschnittenen Fotos aus Pornomagazinen geschmückt gewesen sein. Teppiche, Möbel und Deko waren schwarz gehalten. Vorhänge dunkelten die Zimmer stets ab und die Temperatur wurde kalt gehalten.
GoT-Star klagt gegen Manson
Auch andere betroffene Frauen haben rechtliche Schritte gegen Manson eingeleitet. Dazu zählt der ""Games of Thrones""-Star Esmé Bianco. Die Schauspielerin reichte Anfang des Jahres Klage gegen den Schockrocker ein. Dessen Anwalt stellte einen Antrag auf Abweisung der Klage. Ein Richter hat dies abgelehnt, wie mehrere US-Medien berichten. Die Klage bleibt also weiterhin bestehen. Manson soll Bianco zwischen 2009 und 2013 mehrmals körperlich, sexuell, psychisch und emotional missbraucht haben.
Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte im Februar dieses Jahres ""Westworld""-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood, die mehrere Jahre mit Manson liiert gewesen war. Wood hatte auf Instagram behauptet, dass Manson sie ""jahrelang schrecklich missbraucht"" habe. Sie sei ""einer Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und durch Manipulation zur Unterwerfung gebracht"" worden.

"Marilyn Manson - To τέρας που κρυβόταν σε κοινή θέα - Αιχμαλώτιζε, βίαζε και κακοποιούσε γυναίκες","Για χρόνια ο Marilyn Manson, του οποίου το πραγματικό όνομα είναι Brian Warner, λατρεύτηκε σαν θεός. Τα Μέσα τον θεωρούσαν απλώς «προκλητικό» και «εκκεντρικό». Εκτός σκηνής όμως ήταν ένας βιαστής, που μετέτρεπε σε κόλαση τη ζωή των γυναικών.
Ήταν ένα τέρας, όπως τον χαρακτηρίζει το περιοδικό «Rolling Stone», το οποίο με έρευνά του φέρνει στο φως την «κρυφή» ζωή του.
Την ώρα που όλοι τον θεωρούσαν «ροκ» εκείνος κυνηγούσε τις συντρόφους του με τσεκούρια, τις βίαζε και τις κακοποιούσε τόσο ψυχολογικά όσο και σεξουαλικά.
Το διαμέρισμά του ήταν ένα κολαστήριο για εκείνες
Είχε τσεκούρια, μαστίγια και ήταν γεμάτο αίμα, σβάστικες και πορνό.

Ένα μαύρο σπίτι
Εκτός από τον συγκεκριμένο χώρο, το υπόλοιπο διαμέρισμα του μουσικού ήταν διακοσμημένο με αίμα, σβάστικες και κομμένες φωτογραφίες από περιοδικά πορνό με γυναικεία γεννητικά όργανα.
Πάνω από το κρεβάτι του υπήρχε ένα μήνυμα με σπρέι, και τη λέξη «AIDS».
Τα χαλιά, τα έπιπλα και όλη η διακόσμηση ήταν μαύρη, όπως και οι κουρτίνες. Ήθελε να υπάρχει απόλυτο σκοτάδι όλες τις ώρες της ημέρας.
Επίσης, ήθελε η θερμοκρασία να είναι πάρα πολύ χαμηλή. Αν κάποιος τολμούσε να ανεβάσει τη θερμοκρασία, γινόταν έξαλλος και έσπαγε τα πάντα. Μία από τις πρώην συντρόφους του χαρακτηρίζει το διαμέρισμα «μαύρο ψυγείο».
Όπλο του το τσεκούρι
Πολλές είναι οι γυναίκες που αναφέρουν ότι τους στερούσε τον ύπνο και το φαγητό, τις βίαζε, τις δάγκωνε, τις μαστίγωνε χωρίς φυσικά τη συναίνεσή τους.
Επίσης, αναφέρουν ότι τις κυνηγούσε με τσεκούρι και άνοιγε τρύπες στον τοίχο.
Τα παραπάνω επιβεβαιώνει και η Esme Bianco, η γνωστή ηθοποιός του Game of Thrones, που έζησε στο συγκεκριμένο σπίτι για δύο χρόνια.
Ο Manson αρνείται κάθε κατηγορία και μέσω του δικηγόρου του επισημαίνει ότι όλες οι κοπέλες πήγαιναν εκεί με τη θέλησή τους και ότι όλα γίνονταν αφού είχαν συναινέσει. Η έρευνα αναφέρει και την … οικογενειακή κατάσταση του Warner, ο οποίος είχε ένα βίαιο πατέρα με περίεργο χαρακτήρα και μία μάνα στην οποία είχε αδυναμία αλλά την κακοποιούσε λεκτικά.
«Το όνομα του κακοποιητή μου είναι Brian Warner»
Θυμίζουμε ότι η γνωστή ηθοποιός Evan Rachel Wood έχει ήδη από τον Φεβρουάριο καταγγείλει τον Marilyn Manson.
Με μία ανάρτηση στο προσωπικό της προφίλ στο Instagram αποκάλυψε ότι ήταν θύμα ψυχολογικής κακοποίησης για πολλά χρόνια από τον τραγουδιστή. Η σχέση τους έγινε γνωστή το 2007, όταν εκείνη ήταν 19 και εκείνος 38. Το 2010 αρραβωνιάστηκαν και επτά μήνες μετά χώρισαν.

Marilyn Manson: Neue Aussagen von Ex-Freundin zeichnen Bild eines Sadisten,"Zu den Missbrauchsvorwürfen gegen Marilyn Manson gibt es neue Details, die einen wirklich gruseln lassen. Aussagen seiner Ex-Freundin zeichnen das Bild eines Sadisten.
Gegen Marilyn Manson (52) wurden bereits Anfang des Jahres Vorwürfe laut, er hätte seine Ex-Freundinnen sexuell missbraucht und gequält. Das behauptete unter anderem US-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (33). Jetzt bringt ein neuer Bericht weitere Details zu den Abgründen des Schockrockers ans Licht. Was sagt Manson selbst zu den schlimmen Vorwürfen? Das seht ihr oben im Video!
Manson, der mit bürgerlichem Namen Brian Warner heißt, soll seine Partnerinnen in einem schalldichten Raum über mehrere Stunden eingeschlossen haben, wenn sie ihn ""verärgert"" haben, wie mehrere Zeugen dem amerikanischen ""The Rolling Stone"" bestätigten. Marilyn Manson soll über Folterraum gewitzelt haben Insgesamt 55 Personen interviewte das Magazin für seine Recherchen. Manson gab dem Raum, den der Vorbesitzer der Wohnung als Tonstudio eingebaut hatte, sogar einen Namen: ""Bad Girls Room"" (dt. ""Böse-Mädchen-Raum""). Laut Mansons ehemaliger Assistentin Ashley Walters soll der Musiker sogar öffentlich Witze über den Raum gemacht haben.
Ex-Freundin Ashley Morgan Smithline erklärte, dass Manson seinen ""Bad Girls Room"", der so groß wie ein Umkleideraum gewesen sein soll, ihr zuerst als ""cool"" verkaufte. Doch schnell wurde es schnell zur Bestrafung. ""Selbst wenn ich geschrien hätte, niemand hätte mich gehört"", so Smithline. ""Zuerst kämpfst du und er genießt deinen Kampf. Ich lernte nicht zu kämpfen, weil es das war, was er wollte. Ich ging mit meinem Kopf einfach woanders hin."" Marilyn Mansons Horrorhaus: Frauen beschreiben ihn als ""schwarzen Kühlschrank"" Nicht nur diese Aussage klingt nach einem Horrorfilm. Andere Frauen beschreiben Mansons Wohnung als ""schwarzen Kühlschrank"", denn der Sänger soll sein schwarzes Interieur rund um die Uhr mit Vorhängen abgedunkelt und die Temperatur runtergefahren haben. Wenn jemand die Heizung aufdrehte, soll der Musiker ausgerastet sein. Der Schockrocker selbst bestreitet übrigens die Vorwürfe von seinen Ex-Freundinnen. In einem Instagram-Statement schrieb er bereits im Feburar: ""Offensichtlich waren mein Leben und meine Kunst lange Zeit Magneten für Kontroversen, aber diese jüngsten Behauptungen über mich sind schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität.""",2021-11-16T10:49:25Z,https://www.bunte.de,BUNTE.de
Marilyn Manson soll Frauen in schalldichte Kammer gesperrt haben,"Neue Recherchen über den Grusel-Rocker geben Einblicke in den schockierenden Alltag seiner Ex-Freundinnen. Sie sollen teils stundenlang in eine Glaszelle eingesperrt worden sein.
Als Bestrafung : Marilyn Manson soll Frauen in schalldichte Kammer gesperrt haben
1 / 8 Skandal-Musiker Marilyn Manson (52) soll seine Ex-Freundinnen teils stundenlang in eine schalldichte Glaskammer gesperrt haben, wie «Rolling Stone» zurzeit berichtet. Getty Images via AFP/Frazer Harrison Seit Beginn des Jahres weist der US-Amerikaner Anschuldigungen wegen emotionaler, körperlicher sowie sexueller Gewalt von sich. Über ein Duzend Frauen haben sich bereits gegen ihn ausgesprochen.

In seiner Gegenwart habe sie oft Angst um ihre Sicherheit gehabt. Instagram/smashleywalters
Darum gehts Über ein Dutzend Frauen werfen dem Skandal-Rocker Marilyn Manson emotionale, körperliche sowie sexuelle Misshandlung vor.
Vier davon gehen zurzeit auch rechtlich gegen den 52-Jährigen vor.
Der Sänger streitet die Vorwürfe ab.
Neue «Rolling Stone»-Recherchen zeigen nun weitere Einblicke in den mutmasslich schockierenden Alltag seiner Ex-Freundinnen.
Anfang Jahr haben über ein Dutzend Frauen Marilyn Manson emotionale, körperliche sowie sexuelle Misshandlung vorgeworfen. Anschuldigungen, die der Grusel-Rocker bis heute von sich weist. Nun gibt eine intensive Recherche des «Rolling Stone»-Magazins, die auf Gerichtsdokumenten sowie über 55 Interviews basiert, weitere schockierende Einblicke in den Fall.
So soll der 52-Jährige, der bürgerlich Brian Warner heisst, seine Freundinnen regelmässig als Bestrafung in eine schalldichte Kammer gesperrt haben – teils stundenlang. Das Glasgehäuse im Eck eines Raumes soll etwa so gross wie eine Umkleidekabine gewesen sein und wurde vom vorherigen Mieter als kleines Musikstudio genutzt. Manson habe die Zelle zum «Bad Girls Room» gemacht, mit dem er Frauen psychologisch gefoltert habe.
Masons prahlte offen mit der Kammer
Ein Geheimnis war die Kammer jedoch bei weitem nicht. Der Sänger soll in seinem Umfeld und sogar in der Presse damit geprahlt haben. «Wenn jemand böse ist, kann ich die Person dort einsperren – es ist schalldicht», soll Manson laut «Rolling Stone» 2012 gegenüber einer Zeitschrift erzählt haben. Ashley Walters, eine ehemalige Assistentin, die eine Klage gegen den US-Amerikaner eingereicht hat, erinnert sich, dass er stets in einem «scherzhaften, angeberischen Ton» darüber gesprochen habe.
Mansons Ex-Freundin Ashley Morgan Smithline, die unter anderem wegen sexueller Nötigung und Freiheitsberaubung gegen Manson klagt, erzählt «Rolling Stone», dass Warner sie wiederholt gezwungen habe, für mehrere Stunden in der Zelle zu verweilen. Model Sarah McNeillye berichtete zudem bereits im Februar auf Instagram: «Ich wurde eingesperrt, wenn ich ‹böse› war. Manchmal wurde ich dabei sogar gezwungen, ihm zuzuhören, wie er mit anderen Frauen Spass hat.»
«Schwarzer Kühlschrank»
Auch sonst haben laut «Rolling Stone» in seiner Wohnung grenzwertige Zustände geherrscht. Sie soll mit Blut und Hakenkreuzen dekoriert gewesen sein. Ex-Freundinnen bezeichnen das Zuhause als «schwarzen Kühlschrank» oder «Fleischkammer». Die Inneneinrichtung sei komplett schwarz gewesen, einschliesslich der Vorhänge, mit denen er praktisch rund um die Uhr die Räume verdunkelte. Ausserdem soll es stets eiskalt gewesen sein.

Marilyn Manson: Το τέρας που κρυβόταν σε κοινή θέα - Αιχμαλώτιζε και βίαζε γυναίκες,"Συγκλονίζουν οι αποκαλύψεις που φέρνει στο φως το περιοδικό Rolling Stone για τον Αμερικανό τραγουδιστή Μέριλιν Μάνσον, σε βάρος του οποίου εκκρεμούν τρεις μηνύσεις και δεκάδες καταγγελίες γυναικών για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση. Όπως αποκαλύπτει μεταξύ άλλων το αμερικανικό περιοδικό στο άθρο του με τίτλο «Το τέρας που κρυβόταν σε κοινή θέα», ο εκκεντρικός performer και άλλοτε αγαπημένο παιδί των μίντια είχε στο διαμέρισμά του ειδικό ηχομονωμένο χώρο που προσομοίαζε σε κελί εγκλεισμού, στον οποίο φέρεται να αιχμαλώτιζε γυναίκες για να τις βασανίσει ψυχολογικά.

Στο πλαίσιο της έρευνας, που διήρκεσε εννέα μήνες, οι συντάκτες του Rolling Stone μίλησαν με περισσότερους από 55 ανθρώπους που έχουν γνωρίσει τον Marilyn Manson, ανάμεσά τους κάποιες από τις γυναίκες που τον έχουν καταγγείλει για σεξουαλική ή ψυχολογική κακοποίηση, όπως η ηθοποιός 'Εσμε Μπιάνκο που έπαιξε στη σειρά Game of Thrones.
Οι μαρτυρίες σκιαγραφούν το προφίλ ενός ανθρώπου που προσέγγιζε τις γυναίκες με κολακείες και «μαύρο» χιούμορ προτού εμφανίσει ένα μοτίβο κακοποίησης που φέρεται να περιελάμβανε μαστίγωμα, χάραγμα αρχικών στο δέρμα, αναγκαστικό εγκλεισμό και βιασμό. Γυναίκες κατηγορούν τον Manson πως τους προσέφερε ναρκωτικά, αλκοόλ και έλεγχε τις διατροφικές τους συνήθειες αλλά και τον ύπνο τους. Υποστηρίζουν πως τις κρατούσε αιχμάλωτες, συναισθηματικά και σωματικά μέχρι να υποκύψουν στη θέλησή του. Αν ήθελαν να τον εγκαταλείψουν, λένε, απειλούσε να αυτοκτονήσει ή και να τις σκοτώσει.

O Manson - κατά κόσμον Μπάιαν Χιου Γουόρνερ - έχει αρνηθεί κατηγορηματικά τους ισχυρισμούς, χαρακτηρίζοντάς τους ως μέρος μιας «απαίσιας διαστρέβλωσης της πραγματικότητας». Παραδόθηκε στην αστυνομία τον περασμένο Ιούλιο και αφέθηκε ελεύθερος χωρίς εγγύηση.
Bad Girl's Room
Σύμφωνα με το Rolling Stone, στο διαμέρισμα του Manson που βρισκόταν πάνω από ένα ποτοπωλείο στο δυτικό Χόλιγουντ, υπήρχε ειδικά διαμορφωμένος χώρος με ηχομόνωση, τον οποίο χρησιμοποιούσε για να βασανίζει γυναίκες ψυχολογικά. Φέρεται να τον αποκαλούσε ""Bad Girl's Room"" (Το δωμάτιο για τα κακά κορίτσια). Συνεργάτες και πρώην σύντροφοί του είπαν στο περιοδικό πως ο τραγουδιστής «εξόριζε» σε αυτόν τον χώρο γυναίκες και τις κρατούσε εκεί για ώρες προκειμένου να τις τιμωρήσει για τα παραμικρά «παραπτώματα».
Η Άσλεϊ Γουόλτερς, πρώην συνεργάτιδά του που τον έχει μηνύσει για σεξουαλική επίθεση μεταξύ άλλων, δηλώνει ότι ο Manson απολάμβανε να λέει σε άλλους για αυτόν τον θάλαμο. Ο πρώην βοηθός του, Ράιαν Μπράουν, που συνεργαζόταν με τον τραγουδιστή για 8 χρόνια αρνείται ότι είδε γυναίκες να κλείνονται στο «δωμάτιο των κακών κοριτσιών». Αλλά, συμπληρώνει, «ήταν γνωστό ότι έτσι το έλεγαν όλοι».
Η Άσλεϊ Μόργκαν Σμιθλάιν, που του έχει κάνει μήνυση για σεξουαλική επίθεση και παράνομη φυλάκιση μεταξύ άλλων, λέει ότι επανειλημμένα την είχε αναγκάσει να μείνει για ώρες σε αυτό τον χώρο, που έχει περίπου το μέγεθος δοκιμαστηρίου, όταν είχαν σχέση. «Στην αρχή το έκανε να ακούγεται cool. Μετά, το έκανε να ακούγεται πολύ τιμωρητικό. Ακόμη κι αν ούρλιαζα, κανένας δεν θα με άκουγε. Στην αρχή παλεύεις και εκείνος απολαμβάνει την πάλη. Έμαθα να μην το παλεύω, γιατί του έδινα αυτό που ήθελε. Απλά πήγαινα κάπου αλλού με το μυαλό μου», δηλώνει.
Διαμέρισμα με αίμα και σβάστικες
Το υπόλοιπο διαμέρισμα του Marilyn Manson ήταν διακοσμημένο με αίμα, σβάστικες και κομμένες φωτογραφίες από πορνοπεριοδικά, σύμφωνα με το Rolling Stone. «Υπήρχαν κόλποι παντού», λέει άτομο που είχε επισκεφθεί τον χώρο. Άλλοι, θυμούνται ότι είχαν δει ότι πάνω από το κρεβάτι του υπήρχε μήνυμα γραμμένο με σπρέι, που ανέφερε «AIDS». Τα έπιπλα, τα χαλιά και άλλα αντικείμενα ήταν μαύρα, όπως και οι κουρτίνες που ο τραγουδιστής χρησιμοποιούσε για να μπλοκάρει το φως σε κάθε παράθυρο, σχεδόν όλη την ημέρα.
Η θερμοκρασία ήταν σταθερά χαμηλή και αν κάποιος την ανέβαζε ο Manson είχε ξεσπάσματα και κατέστρεφε έπιπλα, σύμφωνα με την έρευνα. Μία πρώην σύντροφός του αναφέρεται στο διαμέρισμα ως «το μαύρο ψυγείο». Άλλη το περιγράφει ως «καταψύκτη για κρέατα». Εκεί, υποστηρίζουν πολλές πρώην του, ο Marilyn Manson διέπραξε επανειλημμένες πράξεις ψυχικής, σωματικής και σεξουαλικής κακοποίησης, που τις άφησε να παλεύουν με περιόδους άγχους, κατάθλιψης, κρίσεων πανικού αλλά και με διαταραχή μετατραυματικού στρες.
Μαστίγωμα και ηλεκτροπληξία
Η Έσμε Μπιάνκο δηλώνει ότι συχνά την κακοποιούσε λεκτικά, της στερούσε την τροφή και τον ύπνο, την δάγκωνε, την έκοβε, της προκαλούσε ηλεκτροπληξία, τη μαστίγωνε χωρίς τη συγκατάθεσή της και τη βίαζε κατά τη διάρκεια της διετούς σχέσης τους.
Μάλιστα η ηθοποιός λέει ότι κατά τη διάρκεια ενός τρομακτικού επεισοδίου ο τραγουδιστής έπιασε ένα τσεκούρι και την κυνηγούσε στο διαμέρισμα, ανοίγοντας τρύπες στους τοίχους.
«Αυτή ήταν η τελευταία σταγόνα για εμένα», λέει η Μπιάνκο, που του έχει κάνει μήνυση για σεξουαλική επίθεση και sex trafficking. Η ηθοποιός εξήγησε ότι ένιωθε «σε άμεσο κίνδυνο για τη ζωή της». Το να φύγει, λέει «ήταν η καλύτερη προσπάθειά μου για να επιβιώσω».

Marilyn Manson: Sperrte er Frauen in eine schalldichte Kammer?,"Marilyn Manson (52) setzt musikalisch auf Schockeffekte. Doch auch der Alltag an der Seite des Skandal-Musikers muss für viele seiner Frauen der blanke Horror gewesen zu sein.
Nachdem bereits im Mai insgesamt 15 Frauen, darunter das Model Ashley Morgan Smithline (36), US-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (33) und GoT-Star Esmé Bianco (38) massive Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen den Schock-Rocker erhoben haben, kommen nun neue, fürchterliche Grusel-Details über Manson ans Licht.
Wie das amerikanische Musikmagazin „The Rolling Stone“ berichtet, soll Marilyn Manson seine Freundinnen immer wieder in einen kleinen, schalldichten Raum eingesperrt haben. Als Strafe, wenn sie sich angeblich „schlecht“ benommen hatten. Das fanden die Autoren in Gesprächen mit insgesamt 55 Personen heraus.
Die winzige Kabine soll sich in seinem Apartment in Los Angeles (USA) befunden haben. Ein früherer Mieter habe das enge, mit Schaumstoff zur Schallisolierung ausgekleidete, Glasgehäuse in einer Zimmerecke gebaut, um Musik zu produzieren. Manson solle es dann zur Psycho-Folter-Kammer gedient haben. Er nannte ihn den „Bad Girls Room“ (deutsch: Raum der bösen Mädchen).

Die Frauen habe er zum Teil stundenlang dort eingesperrt. Ihre Schreie wurden durch den Schaumstoff gedämpft. Aus den persönlichen Geschichten der Opfer werde deutlich, dass sich hinter dem sorgfältig kultivierten Schockrocker-Mythos „ein Monster in Sichtweite“ versteckte, so „The Rolling Stone“.

„Er erwähnte diesen Raum stets in einem scherzhaften, prahlenden Ton“, wird Warners ehemalige Assistentin Ashley Walters zitiert. Auch Walters wirft ihrem ehemaligen Chef sexuelle Übergriffe vor. Und die Existenz der Schreckenskammer sei allgemein bekannt gewesen. „Wenn jemand böse ist, kann ich ihn dort einsperren, und es ist schalldicht“, soll Manson 2012 gegenüber einer Zeitschrift geprahlt haben. Nur habe niemand etwas dagegen unternommen.
Im Mai 2021 hatte das Ashley Morgan Smithline dem „People Magazine“ erklärt, er habe sie in diesen Raum gesperrt, als sie ihn „verärgert“ habe. „Zuerst ließ er es cool klingen“, so Smithline, „dann ließ er es sehr strafend klingen. Selbst wenn ich schrie, würde mich niemand hören.“
Auch das Model Sarah McNeillye erzählte bereits im Februar auf Instagram von dem Grusel-Zimmer: „Ich wurde emotional misshandelt, terrorisiert und mit Narben gezeichnet. Ich wurde in Räume eingesperrt, wenn ich 'böse' war, manchmal war ich gezwungen, ihm zuzuhören, wie er mit anderen Frauen Spaß hat.“

Die Wohnung selbst bezeichnen die Frauen im aktuellen Interview als „schwarzer Kühlschrank“. Teppiche, Möbel und Deko waren schwarz, ebenso wie die Vorhänge, mit denen er fast 24 Stunden am Tag das Licht aus jedem Fenster verdunkelte. Die Temperatur wurde eiskalt gehalten. Wenn jemand das Thermostat über 18 Grad einstellte, soll Manson Wutanfälle bekommen haben.
Brutale Gewalt, bizarre Sexspiele, körperliche Misshandlungen, psychischer Terror– all diese Qualen, die die Frauen angeblich durch Manson erleiden mussten, sollen in dieser Wohnung stattgefunden haben.
▶︎ Schon 2018 war eine Anzeige gegen Manson erstattet worden. Dabei ging es um mutmaßliche Sexualdelikte im Jahr 2011. Die Staatsanwaltschaft stellte das Verfahren aber ein.
Manson selbst hat sich zu den neuesten Vorwürfen bisher nicht geäußert. Die mehrfachen Anschuldigungen wegen Vergewaltigung und sexuellen Misshandlungen hatte er als „schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität“ zurückgewiesen. Laut einer Erklärung seines Anwalts bestreite er „vehement alle Vorwürfe des sexuellen Übergriffs oder Missbrauchs von Personen“.
Im Februar äußerte er sich via Instagram: „Offensichtlich waren mein Leben und meine Kunst lange Zeit Magneten für Kontroversen, aber diese jüngsten Behauptungen über mich sind schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität“.",2021-11-16T02:04:27Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD
Marilyn Manson: Rolling Stone investigation unearths alleged ‘torture chamber’,"Marilyn Manson would lock the women he dated in a tiny chamber he named the “Bad Girls’ Room”, an explosive new report alleges.
Accused sexual abuser Marilyn Manson had such an obsessive grip on the women he dated that he would lock them in a soundproof room, an explosive new report alleges.
Rolling Stone’s nine-month investigation, published on Monday, reported that the goth rocker allegedly turned the music studio of his West Hollywood apartment into a torture chamber called the “Bad Girls’ Room” – where it is claimed he “banished” his girlfriends and punished them for hours over the “tiniest perceived transgressions”.
Manson has denied all allegations against him.
Manson’s former assistant Ashley Walters, who is suing him for sexual assault and battery, claimed the Beautiful People singer “always” joked and bragged about the room, Page Six reports.
Another former assistant, Ryan Brown, denied ever seeing any women confined in the “Bad Girls’ Room,” but he told the magazine, “It was common knowledge – that’s what everybody had called it.”

Manson, 52, whose real name is Brian Warner, reportedly confirmed the existence of the room himself, stating in a magazine interview back in 2012: “If anyone’s bad, I can lock them in it, and it’s soundproof.”
Manson’s ex-girlfriend Ashley Morgan Smithline, who has accused the rocker of raping and abusing her during their two-year, on-and-off relationship, claimed she was one of the women forced to stay inside the room.
“At first, he made it sound cool,” the model told Rolling Stone. “Then, he made it sound very punitive. Even if I was screaming, no one would hear me.”
Smithline said the space was about the size of a department store dressing room. She alleged that if she fought Manson over going into the room, he would “enjoy” the struggle.
“I learned to not fight it, because that was giving him what he wanted,” she said. “I just went somewhere else in my head.”

According to Rolling Stone, the Dope Show singer’s pad was decorated with blood, swastikas and clipped photos from pornographic magazines.
“There were vaginas everywhere,” a source who visited the apartment claimed in the report.
Others recalled a spray-painted message above Manson’s bed that read “AIDS”. The decor was reportedly all black and the thermostat was always kept below 18C – otherwise Manson allegedly threw temper tantrums.
The apartment was where the Grammy nominee allegedly inflicted “repeated acts of mental, physical and sexual abuse that have left [his victims] with crippling bouts of anxiety, depression, panic attacks and PTSD,” according to the report.

Since early this year, at least 15 women – including Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco – have accused the singer of various levels of sexual, psychological and physical abuse. Although his case against Jane Doe was dismissed in September, a judge ruled in October to continue proceedings with Bianco’s case.
Manson has denied all allegations. His lawyer, Howard King, told Page Six in April that Bianco’s claims “are provably false”.
Manson again denied the claims in a statement to Rolling Stone on Sunday.
The singer said via his lawyer that he “vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual or abuse of anyone” and described the accusations as “part of a co-ordinated attack by former partners and associates of Mr Warner who have weaponised the otherwise mundane details of his personal life and their consensual relationships.”
Manson has further argued in court filings that his accusers “are desperately trying to conflate the imagery and artistry of [his] ‘shock rock’ stage persona, ‘Marilyn Manson,’ with fabricated accounts of abuse,” according to Rolling Stone.
When asked for comment, Manson’s rep told Page Six: “We don’t have anything further to add beyond our statements in the article.”

Marilyn Manson Reportedly Locked “Bad Girls” In A Soundproof Room,"Marilyn Manson has faced dozens of allegations from women over the years, but a new story from Rolling Stone says that the shock-rocker reportedly locked his victims in something he often referred to as the “Bad Girls’ Room.”
A group of women has come forward and shared their stories with the music publication, recounting the horrifying details of the small booth that’s said to sit in the corner of his West Hollywood apartment. It’s been said that Manson would lock people in there for hours on end as a method of psychological torture for any perceived transgressions.

A former assistant of the 52-year-old revealed that the room’s existence was common knowledge, although he says he never saw anyone actually locked inside the foam-covered booth, which was built to contain any noise emitted from inside.
TMZ notes that Manson seemingly mentioned the “Bad Girls’ Room” in interviews over the years, but many of the comments were brushed off as jokes. Thanks to the Rolling Stone story, we know that, to the “Killing Stranger” singer’s victims, it was an all-too-real form of abuse.
Rumour has it that the Ohio-born recording artist’s home has been compared to a “meat locker” or “black refrigerator” on more than one occasion, where things are super dark and the temperature remains below 65 degrees at all times. Those who chatted with RS alleged that much of what they endured went down at Manson’s home – claims he has since denied.

Vermeende slachtoffers Marilyn Manson: hij stopte ons in een cel,"Vermeende slachtoffers van Marilyn Manson hebben opnieuw gesproken over het misbruik waarmee ze te maken zouden hebben gehad. Aan Rolling Stone vertellen meerdere vrouwen onder meer dat de Amerikaanse shockrocker hen opsloot in een kleine glazen cel in zijn oude appartement als ze zich in zijn ogen misdroegen. Manson zou dat de Bad Girls Room hebben genoemd.
Meerdere vrouwen herinneren zich urenlang voor 'straf' in de cel opgesloten te hebben gezeten. Ashley Morgan Smithline, een ex van de zanger die hem aanklaagt voor onder meer seksueel misbruik, beweert dat ze vaker werd opgesloten. ""Eerst vecht je ertegen maar daar geniet hij van. Ik leerde mezelf aan niet tegen te stribbelen zodat ik hem niet gaf wat hij wilde."" Ashley Walters, de voormalige assistent van Manson, zegt dat haar oud-werkgever graag opschepte over het kamertje.
Manson huurde het appartement naar verluidt rond 2010 en het zat er volgens een paar van zijn ex-vriendinnen vol bloedplekken. Een dame omschrijft het als een ""zwarte koelkast"" omdat het er zwart en ijskoud was. Game of Thrones-actrice Esmé Bianco, die een korte relatie met Manson had, werd er naar eigen zeggen meermaals misbruikt. Ze verliet hem toen hij haar met een bijl achterna zou hebben gezeten, zo vertelde ze aan Rolling Stone.

"Um apartamento gelado, uma cela de tortura e anos de abusos: como Marilyn Manson terá colocado as namoradas em perigo","Duas investigações desenvolvidas pelas revistas Rolling Stone e Los Angeles Times, publicadas este domingo, reuniram vários testemunhos de ex-namoradas e antigos colegas de trabalho do cantor Marilyn Manson que revelam episódios de violência psicológica e física e abuso sexual protagonizadas pela estrela de rock.
Durante nove meses, as duas publicações reuniram documentos judiciais e entrevistaram mais de 55 pessoas que conheceram Marilyn Manson em várias fases da sua vida, e juntaram testemunhos de antigas namoradas do cantor que dizem ser vítimas de abuso psicológico e sexual durante o período dos relacionamentos.
Nos seus testemunhos, as mulheres - entre elas, Ashley Walters, uma antiga assistente do cantor, Ashley Morgan Smithline, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood e a modelo Sarah McNeilly, ex-namoradas do cantor - falam de uma cela solitária, à prova de som, onde ficavam enclausuradas durante horas como castigo pelas mais pequenas transgressões que cometiam perante Manson.
De acordo com as alegadas vítimas, a cela, que era toda envidraçada e que estava localizada no canto de uma sala no apartamento de Manson, em West Hollywood, era denominada pelo próprio cantor como ""o quarto das meninas más"".
Ashley Walters, a antiga assistente de Manson, que recentemente abriu um processo contra a estrela de rock por agressão sexual e outras acusações, diz que o cantor gostava de contar às pessoas sobre a cela:
Ele falava dela sempre com um tom de brincadeira, gabando-se”, recorda Walters.
Aliás, a Rolling Stone recorda mesmo uma entrevista em que Marilyn Manson falou abertamente sobre a respetiva cela: “Se alguém se portar mal, posso prendê-la ali [na cela], que é à prova de som”, afirmou, numa entrevista para uma revista, em 2012.
Ashley Morgan Smithline, que está a processar o cantor por agressão sexual, entre outras acusações, conta à Rolling Stone que, durante o período em que namoraram, Marilyn Manson a forçou repetidamente a permanecer no interior da cela – que era do tamanho de um provador de uma loja de roupa – durante horas.
No início, ele fez com que parecesse algo fixe”, admitiu Smithline, acrescentando, de seguida: “Depois, ele tornou a cela como algo muito punitivo. Mesmo se eu estivesse a gritar, ninguém conseguia ouvir-me”.
“A primeira reação é sempre lutar - e ele gostava dessa luta. Aprendi a não lutar [contra o castigo], porque era isso que ele queria. Eu simplesmente tentava ir para outro lugar na minha cabeça”, contou à revista.
De acordo com as descrições das mulheres, o interior do apartamento de Manson estava decorado com sangue, suásticas e fotos recortadas de revistas pornográficas. Os tapetes, os móveis e as decorações eram pretos, assim como as cortinas que ele usava para não deixar passar a luz do dia durante quase 24 horas por dia.
A temperatura do apartamento era sempre fria. Se alguém aumentasse a temperatura, Warner reagia com ataques de raiva e destruição de móveis, contaram as alegadas vítimas. Uma ex-namorada referiu-se ao apartamento como um “frigorífico preto"".
Foi naquele apartamento que, de acordo com os testemunhos das antigas namoradas de Manson, o cantor infligia atos repetidos de abuso mental, físico e sexual que as deixaram com crises de ansiedade, depressão e ataques de pânico e de transtorno pós-traumático.
A atriz Esmé Bianco, conhecida pelo seu papel na série Game of Thrones, alega que Marilyn Manson costumava abusar dela verbalmente, privava-a de sono e comida, mordia-a e cortava-a, e chegou a electrocutá-la e chicoteá-la sem o seu consentimento, além de abusar sexualmente dela durante os dois anos em que estiveram juntos.
Em entrevista à Rolling Stone, a atriz lembra um episódio em que Manson a perseguiu pelo apartamento com um machado na mão, ao mesmo tempo que destruía paredes.
“Aquele foi um momento decisivo para mim”, admitiu a atriz, que abriu um processo contra Manson por agressão e tráfico sexual. Bianco diz mesmo que se sentiu “em perigo iminente de vida”, e diz não ter dúvidas de que terminar a relação foi a sua ""melhor tentativa de sobrevivência”.
No último ano, mais de uma dezena de mulheres acusou Manson de abuso psicológico, físico ou sexual. Em março deste ano, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood acusou publicamente Marilyn Manson de abusos sexuais.",2021-11-15T16:02:00Z,https://tvi24.iol.pt,TVI24
"Marilyn Manson torturava mulheres em uma caixa de vidro, diz vítima","O cantor Marilyn Manson, de 52 anos, está sendo acusado pela ex-assistente Ashley Walters de trancar mulheres em uma pequena caixa de vidro à prova de som, que teria o tamanho de um provador de roupas, e seria apelidado de espaço para as ""meninas más"". O local, segundo ela, foi montado no apartamento do roqueiro, em West Hollywood, Califórnia (EUA).
Walters é uma das mais de 10 mulheres que foram à Justiça processar o famoso por assédio sexual e abuso. Ela expôs o espaço que seria usado pelo artista para trancafiar suas vítimas em entrevista à revista Rolling Stone.
A ex-assistente contou que, inicialmente, Marilyn Manson tentava fazer com que a caixa de vidro fosse compreendida como ""algo legal"" para, em seguida, fazer uso do espaço ""como uma forma de punição"" para as mulheres.
""Mesmo que eu gritasse, ninguém podia me ouvir. Você lutava e ele gostava dessa reação. Eu aprendi a não lutar, porque isso dava a ele o que ele queria. Então, eu acabava indo para algum outro lugar dentro da minha cabeça"", disse Ashley.
Ryan Brown, outra ex-funcionária do músico, disse nunca ter presenciado ninguém preso no espaço, mas pontuou que o próprio famoso já havia falado abertamente sobre a caixa durante uma entrevista em 2012. Segundo Brown, o local era considerado por Marilyn Manson como um espaço dedicado às ""meninas más"".
As acusações feitas por Ashley Walters foram corroboradas por Sarah McNeilly, ex-namorada de Manson. Ela relatou que a experiência na caixa de vidro foi ""absolutamente assustadora"" e que o artista a teria trancado no espaço após ela falar sobre um ex-namorado. ""Ali a máscara caiu e foi possível ver do que ele era capaz"", contou.
A ex-namorada disse ainda que foi ameaçada fisicamente por Marilyn Manson em 2011, quando ele, após um surto, fez menção sobre ""amassar"" sua cara com um taco de beisebol. ""A violência física era quase um alívio. A merda psicológica que ele me fazia passar, que infestava o meu cérebro, era o que eu queria que acabasse"", desabafou.
Por fim, segundo a revista, o apartamento em que Marilyn Manson mora é decorado com ""sangue, suásticas e imagens de revistas pornográficas"", e o artista decorou o local todo de preto, a fim de ""tapar a luz das janelas durante o dia"". A reportagem ainda diz que ele ficava violento quando o termóstato do apartamento era ajustado para uma temperatura superior a 18 graus e ""destruía os móveis"".
Modelo disse ter sido abusada por Marilyn Manson
Em junho, a modelo Ashley Morgan Smithline impetrou processo contra Marilyn Manson por abuso sexual. À revista People, ela também disse ter sido vítima de abuso psicológico, emocional e físico durante o relacionamento com o roqueiro.
""Tem sido importante para mim, apresentar o que tenho feito porque vivo com medo constante até hoje. Estou buscando justiça porque quero seguir em frente e me curar do terrível abuso que enfrentei. Quero que Brian Warner [nome de registro do cantor] seja responsabilizado de uma vez por todas"", declarou.
No processo, a defesa da modelo cita um dos episódios de abuso, em que o famoso teria pegado ""uma faca ao lado da cama e começou a cortar o ombro, a parte interna do braço e o estômago da Sra. Smithline"", e que ela ainda possui as cicatrizes.
Além deste, o caso cita estupro, cortes, chicotadas, fraturas e a marcação das iniciais do músico nas pernas da vítima. O famoso também teria ameaçado de morte a modelo caso ela o deixasse e, ainda, falou sobre a caixa para as ""garotas más"".
Em fevereiro deste ano, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood usou seu perfil nas redes sociais para denunciar abusos sofridos na época em que namorou com o cantor entre 2006 e 2010.
No Instagram, ela disse que o nome de seu ""abusador é Brian Warner, também conhecido como Marilyn Manson"". ""Ele começou a me assediar quando eu ainda era uma adolescente e abusou terrivelmente de mim por anos"", relatou ela, alegando ter sofrido ""uma lavagem cerebral"" e ter sido ""manipulada à submissão"".
A atriz Esmé Bianco também processa o músico por tê-la drogado e a ameaçado para manter relações sexuais com ele em ""múltiplas ocasiões"".
Desde o início dos processos, a defesa de Marilyn Manson tem negado as acusações e o cantor afirma que todas as suas relações foram consensuais, e que as denúncias são ""distorções da realidade"".
""Meus relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram totalmente consensuais com companheiras que pensam como eu. Independentemente de como e por que outras estão optando hoje por manipula o passado, está é a verdade"", escreveu o cantor em uma publicação no Instagram.",2021-11-15T15:29:00Z,https://www.uol.com.br,UOL
Rolling Stone Probe Delves Deep Into Marilyn Manson's Alleged Abuse,"(Newser) – Rolling Stone spent nine months speaking to more than 55 sources (some of them accusers who had not previously spoken publicly) for the magazine's extensive investigation into Marilyn Manson, published Sunday night. Many of them painted a picture of someone whose carefully cultivated ""shock rock,"" ""living demon"" persona allowed him to become what the magazine calls ""a monster hiding in plain sight."" Some of Rolling Stone's sources, who in addition to accusers included associates and former friends, described incidents prior to the rocker becoming famous in which he verbally abused his mother, and others describe alleged sexual misdeeds dating back to the early 1990s, including Manson recording sexual encounters and showing the videos to friends.
story continues below
The sources recall his frequent rape jokes and use of the n-word, his disturbing obsession with Nazis, and alleged bad behavior that went beyond the sexual abuse he's accused of—former associates say he was also verbally and physically abusive to band members and employees, and they describe an environment in which no one could be trusted because Manson had all the people surrounding him reporting to him on each other. Similarly, women have accused Manson of psychological torture such as being left in a solitary confinement cell for hours. He is accused of rape, holding women captive, physical abuse and violent threats, and of threatening to kill himself or the women if they left him. Some of his accusers met up last year to compare notes. Read the full article, which is nearly 10,000 words long, here.

"Uma cela, parafernália nazi, anos de abusos: como Marilyn Manson terá submetido as suas vítimas","Duas novas investigações jornalísticas reuniram testemunhos de mais de uma dezena de mulheres que dizem ter sido vítimas de violência sexual às mãos da estrela de rock Marilyn Manson. Revelando detalhes até aqui desconhecidos sobre a existência de uma cela insonorizada em que o músico torturaria física e psicologicamente as suas namoradas, que privava de alimentos e de sono e drogava, a revista Rolling Stone e o Los Angeles Times dão conta de como dois factores terão contribuído para manter o silêncio em torno dos seus alegados abusos: uma rede de colaboradores, técnicas de controlo mental, isolamento e administração de drogas, por um lado; e, por outro, a sua reputação de rocker transgressor e provocador, que ao longo de anos ofuscou actos e declarações problemáticas, a que se foram somando acusações públicas e privadas.",2021-11-15T12:59:29Z,https://www.publico.pt,PÚBLICO

Marilyn Manson Locked Women in Soundproof 'Bad Girls' Room': Report,"Sources told Rolling Stone Marilyn Manson had a soundproof room he used to lock women in.
More than a dozen women have accused the shock rocker of sexual and physical assault.
He has denied the allegations and said all of his relationships have been ""entirely consensual.""

Marilyn Manson had a small, soundproof glass enclosure in his West Hollywood apartment that he used to lock up women he was dating, according to a report published Sunday by Rolling Stone.
Several people who dated the shock rocker, whose real name is Brian Warner, told the outlet the space was a ""solitary-confinement cell used to psychologically torture women."" According to those sources, he called it the ""Bad Girls' Room.""
""He always had a joking, bragging tone,"" Ashley Walters, Warner's former assistant who has accused him of sexual assault, said, claiming that he liked to tell people about the room.
Warner has mentioned the room himself during media appearances, including in a 2011 interview with V Magazine. In May 2021, Ashley Morgan Smithline, one of dozens of women who have accused Warner of abuse, told People Magazine he locked her in the room when she ""pissed him off.""
Singer Phoebe Bridgers said in a tweet in February that when she visited Warner's home as a teenager he referred to one of the rooms as the ""r*pe room,"" which she said she thought was ""horrible frat boy sense of humor"" at the time.
Ryan Brown, another former assistant of Warner's, also told Rolling Stone that the room existed, saying ""it was common knowledge that's what everybody had called it."" He denied ever seeing a woman locked in it.
Attorneys for Warner did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
Many women have come forward to publicly accuse Warner of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse. Evan Rachel Wood said Warner ""horrifically"" abused her while they dated from 2007 to 2010. ""Game of Thrones"" actress Esmé Bianco is suing Warner, claiming he physically and sexually assaulted her. Walter, his former assistant, is also suing him.
Warner has previously denied the allegations against him, writing in a post shared on Instagram in February that ""these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.""
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners,"" he said.
Rolling Stone's report was based on 55 interviews with people who have known Warner. Accusers said the rocker ""was able to hide his abuses in plain sight behind the Marilyn Manson character he created and the music industry that supported, and profited from, his living-demon shtick,"" the outlet wrote.",2021-11-15T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
7 of the wildest performances ever including Ozzy Osborne & Marilyn Manson after Brass Against's Sophia Urista PEED,"BRASS Against's Sophia Urista shocked fans when she was captured on video pulling down her pants and peeing on a fan's face during a concert in Florida.
While the singer's stunt went viral and left many disgusted, rock stars have long used shock-value on stage to up their personas.

From Ozzy's infamous bat bite to Manson's Nazi flag bit, rock fans are no strangers to unexpected stage stunts.
Here we have compiled a list of seven of the wildest performances in recent history.
OZZY OSBOURNE

Ozzy Osbourne's stunt with a bat may be one of the most famous in the history of rock, and that's saying something.
The Prince of Darkness was performing in Des Moines, Iowa, during his 1982 solo tour when a fan threw a bat on stage.
Ozzy picked it up and bit its head off before throwing it back to the audience.
“I thought it was one of those rubber bats. I picked it up and it was a real bat, you know?' Ozzy later said.
The rock star has also said he was taken to the hospital immediately after the show to receive rabies shots.
While Ozzy claimed the bat was alive until ""he bit the head off,"" the man who threw the bat onstage, Mark Neal, told The Des Moines Register the animal had actually been dead for weeks.
MARILYN MANSON

Manson is known for his shocking stage stunts during performances.
But one of his most grotesque ones may be one involving an iron, a Nazi flag and an abortion.
In one of his early concerts in the 90s, the singer featured an actress ironing the wrinkles out of a Nazi flag on stage while he performed.
JIM MORRISON
The Door's lead singer liked to push the boundaries and had a history of testing authority.
He got arrested in 1969 after exposing himself to fans during a concert in Miami.
Rolling Stone reported at the time: ""The outraged aftermath became the object of six arrest warrants, including one for a felony charge of 'Lewd and lascivious behavior in public by exposing his private parts'.""
ALICE COOPER
Alice Cooper's concerts were a place where fans could expect to see some crazy stuff.
One of the rockstar's most famous stunts involved a working guillotine that became a major part of his show.
According to Forbes, ""Most of the time, the concerts have ended with the character of Alice being decapitated by a guillotine.""
""The lyrics are the script. If you say, 'Welcome to my Nightmare,' give the audience a nightmare. Make it come alive,"" Cooper told Forbes.
JIMMY HENDRIX
Hendrix had many iconic performances during his short life.
However, his show at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 is probably one of the most memorable.
That's because Hendrix's guitar was on fire - literally.
In the middle of his performance, Hendrix poured lighter fluid all over his guitar and set it on fire.
Hendrix was so committed to the stunt that he reportedly suffered burns in his hands.
IGGY POP
Iggy Pop is another rocker known for his taste for shock-value.
In 1973, while promoting the Stooge's Raw Power album in Kansas City, Iggy was crowd-surfing when a chair slipped from underneath him, causing a table of glasses to shatter against the floor.
Rolling Stone reported: ""Iggy landed atop them and emerged sliced and stabbed, but kept performing.""
The debate on whether the injuries were accidental or self-inflicted are now part of the Iggy Pop myth.
GG ALLIN
Perhaps GG Allin is the most shocking of this list, given that he was known to defecate on stage during his performances as part of the Punk scene of the 80s.
The Murder Junkies' lead singer had a habit of going to the bathroom on stage and then throwing his feces at fans in the audience.
He was so known for this that his family had to lock his headstone away because fans kept visiting it to defecate on it, as reported by the Daily Beast.
Allin died in 1993 at 36 years old from a heroin overdose.

Marilyn Manson's Sexual Abuse Accuser Says Seeing Him Perform With Justin Bieber and Kanye West Is 'Heartbreaking',"Justin Bieber, Kanye West, and Marilyn Manson might not seem like the trio of performers you would expect to collaborate. But that’s exactly what the three musicians did at West’s Sunday Service on Halloween.
The artists are no strangers to controversy, and Manson has been accused of sexual abuse and assault by multiple women in the past year. After Manson’s Sunday Service appearance, one of his accusers spoke out against West and Bieber for supporting an alleged abuser. Here’s what she had to say.

Several women accused Marilyn Manson of sexual abuse before his performance with Justin Bieber and Kanye West
Since early 2021, Manson has been accused of sexual abuse and assault by several women, including actor and musician Evan Rachel Wood.
On Feb. 1, Wood wrote an Instagram post naming Manson as her abuser. She claimed that he “started grooming [her] when [she] was a teenager” and “horrifically abused [her] for years.” She also wrote that she was “brainwashed and manipulated into submission.”
And according to Vanity Fair, at least four other women have come forward with similar allegations against Manson. They shared their experiences of “sexual assault, psychological abuse, and/or various forms of coercion, violence, and intimidation.”
Manson’s record label dropped him, and the television shows American Gods and Creepshow canceled his scheduled appearances. The “KILL4ME” singer then posted his rebuttal on Instagram.
“Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”

Justin Bieber and Kanye West performed with the disgraced musician at Sunday Service
So, what do Justin Bieber and Kanye West have to do with the Marilyn Manson sexual abuse allegations? On Sunday, Oct. 31, the two artists performed with the disgraced musician during West’s weekly Sunday Service.
One of Manson’s alleged victims, Ashley Morgan Smithline, spoke out against Bieber and West for supporting her abuser. “It’s heartbreaking. It makes me sick,” Smithline told People on Nov. 2. “How is this the world we live in?
“It makes everyone really f—ing sick. This is just like being retraumatized. And it’s just showing the point that the world doesn’t really care if you rape and if you beat and hurt all these [women], you can do whatever you want, basically, if you have money and you’re a guy and you’re famous.”
Speaking of West specifically, Smithline said, “This man has to know that he is enabling a rapist. He’s enabling an abuser and not just [of] one girl.”

The ‘Flashing Lights’ rapper brought Marilyn Manson onstage at his Donda listening party
Sunday Service wasn’t the first time that West showed support for Manson amidst the sexual abuse allegations. On Aug. 26, the “Gold Digger” rapper brought the “Sweet Dreams” singer on stage during his Chicago Donda listening party.
West also invited DaBaby, who was also embroiled in controversy due to making homophobic comments, on stage. The trio posed on a set replicating West’s childhood home. DaBaby and Manson are both featured on the track “Jail, Pt. 2” from the Donda album.
The song had highly suggestive lyrics, considering the allegations Manson is facing. The lyrics Manson sings on the track include, “I’ll be honest, we all liars; I’m pulled over and I got priors; Guess we goin’ down, guess who’s goin’ to jail? Guess who’s goin’ to jail tonight?”

"Kanye Defends Friendship With Marilyn Manson, Shades #MeToo Movement","The internet has been lit with headlines pertaining to Kanye West's wild Drink Champs interview. The rapper sat down for the first time since releasing Donda to chop it up with Noreaga and DJ EFN about all of his scandals, controversies, and career moments. There were several takeaways from the complete conversation, and we've been highlighting many of those moments here on HNHH.
A controversy that Ye has been embroiled in has been his relationship with Marilyn Manson after the shock-rocker appeared alongside West at his Donda listening event in Chicago. Later, Manson also joined Ye and Justin Bieber for an intimate prayer at Sunday Service, but the public vilified the rapper for giving an even greater platform to Manson.
In recent years, Manson has been hit with accusations from several women who have accused him of sexual assault, rape, sexual battery, and holding them against their will. There are lawsuits set against him and as litigation is ongoing, Manson has denied any wrongdoing. Kanye spoke about the backlash he has received for aligning himself with Manson, biting back at Cancel Culture.
“All the Me Too… like, when I sit next to Marilyn Manson and DaBaby right after both of them got canceled, for five songs, you know, it’s like they can’t cancel us all,” Ye explained. “They’ll hit you with the accusations of somebody who you was with 10 years ago. And also, there’s women who’ve been through really serious things, pulled in alleys against their will – that’s different than a hug, but it’s classified as the same thing.""

"Kanye West calls cancel culture, #MeToo part of 'mob mentality'","Kanye West has dismissed #MeToo and “cancel culture” as being part of “1984 mind control” and “mob mentality.”
In a nearly 2 1/2 hour interview with Revolt TV’s “Drink Champs,” the 44-year-old “All Falls Down” rapper dismissed the flood of public sex assault claims as “power and politics” by “power-hungry maniacs.”
“All the #MeToo – like, when I sit next to Marilyn Manson and DaBaby right after both of them got canceled … it’s like, they can’t cancel us all!” said the star, who has formally changed his name to Ye.
He has worked with both musicians despite their scandals, with DaBaby accused of a homophobic tirade at a concert and shock rocker Manson, 52, accused of violent sexual attacks on a slew of women.
Without detailing the allegations against either of the pals he mentioned, Ye dismissed the seriousness of most #MeToo complaints.
“They’ll hit you with the accusations or somebody who you was with 10 years ago,” said the star, who admitted during the interview that he still “wants to be” with estranged wife Kim Kardashian.

“Also, there’s women who’ve been through really serious things, pulled in alleys against they will – that’s different than a hug, but it’s classified as the same thing,” he claimed.
“It’s power and politics. You know, power-hungry maniacs and just, control,” he said.
“This is 1984 mind control that we in,” he said, referring to the George Orwell novel about a dystopian society under constant government control. “And mob mentality,” he said.

Ye laughed when asked his personal thoughts on cancel culture, though.
“Ah man, I love it — I’m above it,” he said, joking that he was deliberately daring critics to cancel him by giving his latest interview.
Ye also made clear that he still supports former President Trump, despite getting attacked for proudly wearing a red MAGA hat.

“I’ve still got a red hat on today, I’ll let y’all know that — I might not got it on, but I’ll let y’all know where I stand,” he said with a smile.

"Kanye West on Marriage Status, Drake Rivalry, Marilyn Manson Alliance","In a wide-ranging two-and-a-half conversation that Revolt TV’s “Drink Champs” billed as its “biggest interview ever,” Kanye West defended aligning himself with Marilyn Manson and DaBaby, knocked Big Sean and John Legend for being “used” by Democrats for “sellout shit,” affirmed that Kim Kardashian West is “still my wife,” spoke out against abortion and cancel culture, and discussed Drake in both admiring and dismissive terms, among many other topics.
It wasn’t revealed exactly when the interview with hosts N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN. But it may have been some time ago, based on one of West’s targets in the interview, Big Sean, tweeting photos of himself hanging out with West and saying he “was just wit this man, he ain’t say none of that!!! And this was after the interview! I’m dying laughing at you, @kanyewest.”
West frequently pointed out during the interview that he knew it would raise controversy, as in a portion of the chat where he said that Black History Month should be abolished, because being historically minded focuses on the subjugations of the past, when there should be a Black Future Month.
Subjects ranged from the mundane (“I love Drake. (Sir) Lucian (Grainge), how you like that one?”) to the sublime (“Collectively, we are God,” West said, adding some new wrinkles to his Christian theology). “I’m gonna take myself public and create a universal basic income… a basic universal wealth,” he promised.
West said he had invited Marilyn Manson, who is facing four lawsuits for sexual assault, to his Sunday Service worship, and defended having given the rocker and DaBaby, still under fire for homophobic comments, to perform alongside him and appear on his latest album, “Donda.”
“All the ‘Me Too’… like, when I sit next to Marilyn Manson and DaBaby, right after both of them got canceled, for five songs, you know, it’s like they can’t cancel a song,” he said. “They’ll hit you with the accusations or somebody who you was with 10 years ago. And also, there’s women who’ve been through very serious things, pulled in alleys against their will; that’s different than a hug, but it’s classified as the same thing. It’s power and politics. You know, power-hungry maniacs and just control. This is ‘1984’ mind-control we’re in.”
West suggested that he hasn’t given up on his marriage, despite the apparent finality. “She’s still my wife,” he said, as long as there’s “no paperwork” to seal his divorce from Kardashian West.
Although not much of the talk was political, and there were few mentions of West’s presidential bid last fall, West made it clear where he stands. “I still got a red hat on today,” he said. Although that wasn’t literal, he said, “I might not got it on, but I’ll let y’all know where I stand.”
Political differences figured into what he described as a sense of disappointment with Big Sean and John Legend, both formerly signed to his G.O.O.D. label. Both artists, he said, “got used quick by the Democrats to come at the boy who actually changed their life. And that’s some sellout shit…. And I don’t rock with neither of them and I need my apologies.”
West elaborated on his feelings about Big Sean in a closing quick-fire round, with one of the questions asking him to state his preference between Pusha, who is still on West’s label, and Big Sean, who departed.
“Oh, I love this! Let me tell you. I already decided that when I die, on my tombstone it’s gonna stay, ‘I deserve to be here because I signed Big Sean’,” Ye said. When one of the hosts murmured a seeming approval. West continued, “No, I’m saying that the worst thing I’ve ever done is sign Big Sean.”
Before those comments went public, Big Sean went on Twitter to say, “I just got asked to be on the next Drink Champs so I’m assuming Ye talking crazy.”
Asked whether he’d ever go on Verzuz, West went into joking hyperbole mode, saying, “Absolutely, but I would need about like four people to go against me at one time.” Specifically: “It would be Drake, right?” asked Ye as to who most people want him to battle against during a Verzuz. “Hov? I didn’t think about that. I wouldn’t go against Jay, though. He’s my boss…. Drake? I’m winning every situation.”
Ye also offered the idea of him doing a month worth of Verzuz where he would battle artists in categories such as producers, songwriter and rappers. He even suggested that he could even go against himself, album Verzuz album, name change Verzuz name change. “Nothing could go against ‘Dark, Twisted Fantasy’ though,” he said, referring to “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” from 2010.
He further comparing his rivalry with Drake to a sports rivalry. “You know what? I bit his ear,” he said, alluding to Mike Tyson biting Evander Holyfield’s ears in a 1997 boxing match.
West went into more detail on Drake. “Drake don’t do an outright diss song… He’s going to set it up like war,” he said. “He’s gonna do stuff like live five blocks down ,,, from you. He’s gonna go and DM every single girl in your family, every single girl around your family, all your [N-words’] girls.” He talked about confronting Drake in a group text that included Kid Cudi, Pusha T, Jay-Z, Travis Scott and others. “One of the lines I said that was legend was, ‘I’m worth more than all of y’all on this text combined’… I had this conversation with Drake that’s like, ‘I never fucked Kim,’ but I was like, ‘But you acted like you did.'” He said he texted Drake, “Did you ever DM her? you know, because it ain’t about just the actual act of it.”
Ultimately, though, Ye said that Drake is an artist who has added greatly to the culture, whose music is possessed of great sophisticated melody, and that he and Drake are on the same team. “We could become the first civilization to become civil.”
Introduced as a “super hero,” a “super genius,” a “fashion icon” and a “visionary,” Ye disagreed with none of those superlatives while announcing he would be “shamelessly name-dropping” celebrity friends such as Ralph Lauren, Steven Spielberg, Hilary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey, all in one eight-word sentence.
Ye started the conversation by tearing down conventional housing and class structures. “I’m not into the class system. That’s one of the main things they use to control us. My whole existence is not about being out of control, but rather, out of their control. Being in control of yourself…. My home is where my daughter FaceTimes me.”
When talking about fellow fashion designers and technology giants, Kanye was quick to call them his contemporaries in the field. “Arnaud is my peer. Balenciaga is my peer. Steve Jobs. Jeff Bezos. These are my peers.” He also discussed his role working for the Gap and his Yeezy X Gap line.
“Ego and anger, they hang out,” he said. “They definitely blood. I wrote this song for the ‘Donda’ album that’s going to wind up on the deluxe (edition).” Ye trailed off, then went on to rap the lyrics to a track called “If I Let Go,” where he performs his own AutoTune fade with the word “Mondrian.. drian… drian.”
”If you ahead long enough you become the head. Lauryn (Hill)’s gonna be mad at me for saying this, but I remember telling her that I was the leader. She was like ‘You a leader. You’re not the leader.”
When asked about why he jumped up onstage during Taylor Swift’s victory over Beyonce during the 2009 VMAs, and if it was liquor was a motivator, he answered, “Well, I was showing both of my addictions.”
When the subject of “the phobia” of mental health came up, Ye mentioned getting a weird haircut, calling the cut a “Britney… which now could be called a ‘Ye,’” and saying that any “declaration of insanity is a form of censorship and control.”
“The most influential rapper today is Future,” said Ye, also giving credit to Chief Keef and Soldja Boy for being voices to listen for. “Drake added something to the algorithm,” due to his level of sophistication, which was different than the Nas and Rakim that Ye grew up with.
Talking about Kim Kardashian West, Ye claimed that she’s “still my wife. There ain’t no paperwork” to show otherwise. Ye also went on to praise Kardashian West as being influential for changing the face of beauty. “White girls in school used to talk down to her for having an ass. Now those same white girls go and get an ass now.”
Ye took a poke at record labels for their brand of enslavement, while talking up Black excellence and self-empowerment. “We’re not just colors in a crayon box… We are kings… But we farm land that isn’t our own: record labels, the NBA, Hollywood.”
Eventually, the “Drink Champs” team played a comparative drinking game with Ye where they threw out rapper names, watched Ye react, and threw back shots.
Common or Talib? “My opinion? Definitely Common…. The only thing I don’t like about Common is that he works for the Democrats and does what they tell him.”
Producers Timbaland or Pharrell? “Timbaland.”
Scarface or Ice Cube? “I like Ice Cube to play, but I like Scarface for his influence… for adding to the flow.”",2021-11-05T11:16:55Z,https://variety.com,Variety
"Ye (Kanye West) on Drake Beef, Cancel Culture & More","N.O.R.E. also pointed out at the beginning of the episode that Ye was about to arrive on set with no security, something that he’s been seen doing more recently, even being seen taking commercial flights to places with his full-face mask on. But don’t be confused, the rapper still takes time to remind everyone that he’s the wealthiest person in the room, saying that he still owns 12,000 acres of property, 1,200 sheep, and various other forms of real estate. Ye also revealed that a deluxe version of Donda will eventually be released and some of the inspiration behind the album’s songs, like “24” being dedicated to the late Kobe Bryant. Ultimately, for better or for worse, Ye left no stone unturned in his inaugural visit to Drink Champs and gave us a glimpse at where his mind is at. To save you the 2 hours and 20 minutes, here are the six things we learned from Ye’s episode of Drink Champs. Ye Thinks No One Can Face Him in a Verzuz Battle Not even 30-minutes into the interview, Ye already gets into how he thinks no one could face him in a Verzuz battle. The rapper said that he would be interested in participating in Swizz Beatz and Timbaland’s series; however, he doesn’t think anyone would be up for the challenge of facing him. “I’m winning in every situation,” Ye responds when asked if he thinks he would beat Drake, another decorated artist, in a battle. In fact, Ye clarified that he thinks it would take “about four people” to go against him head-to-head in a Verzuz, and that he could even go against himself for a whole season of the series, pitting his different albums or different production styles against each other to make it interesting. Ye Doesn’t Hate Drake -- He Hates Subliminals As per usual, Ye had a lot to say about his rap peer/rival/nemesis Drake during his time on Drink Champs. After both of their studio albums, Donda and Certified Lover Boy, dropped a week apart from each other—with the latter containing a very direct diss track in “7am on Bridle Path”—many were curious as to how their relationship got this contentious, and where the feud might go from here. Ye cleared the air about his stance towards Drake and talked about how he dislikes how the Toronto rapper uses subliminals to indirectly disrespect him, like insinuating he slept with Kim Kardashian even though they both know he didn’t. However, Ye also recognizes that Drake’s music has a utilitarian quality to it, and that he makes rap accessible to varying groups of people. “The style of rap that he was doing was more sophisticated from the style of rap I grew up on,” Ye explained. He clarifies that he doesn’t hate Drake, and that he thinks he’s an influential artist who “added something to the algorithm” in terms of changing the way people engage with hip-hop. At one point, Ye even revealed that his favorite song on CLB is “TSU'' and that he wanted the beat for the song himself. While they don’t have the best relationship, Ye appreciates what Drake does for music, just not the sneaky way he goes about getting under his skin on songs.
He Disagrees with Big Sean and John Legend’s Political Affiliations Big Sean recently revealed that he left G.O.O.D. Music after 14 years of being signed to the label to secure a “bigger cut” of profits for himself, and Ye just added more fuel to the proverbial dumpster fire by saying that signing the Detroit rapper to his label was “the worst thing I’ve ever done.” While he never says he has a problem with Sean as a person, he did say that he feels like the Detroit rapper is a “sellout” for how he and John Legend publicly supported Joe Biden and the Democratic Party this past election cycle. “Nah, look, I know this man’s mama,” Ye explained. “I’ve changed this man’s family. And both John Legend and Big Sean, when I ran for office, got used quick by the Democrats to come at they boy that actually changed they life and that’s some sellout shit. And I don’t rock with neither of them and I need my apologies… n----s is scared.” Only a few minutes after the episode aired, Sean took to Twitter to reveal that he and Ye were just together at what looks like his Sunday Service concert held during Halloween. “Was just wit this man, he ain’t say none of that!!! And this was after the interview! I’m dying laughing at you @kanyewest,” Sean tweeted. It didn’t appear like Sean and Ye’s relationship was that fractured, but given these new comments, it’s unclear where they stand now. He Still Wants to be With Kim Kardashian and Preserve His Family Ye brought up several times during his Drink Champs interview that he still wants to preserve his marriage with Kim Kardashian—who officially filed for divorce from him on Feb. 19—he hates her publicist, and he hates Hulu and E! Network. Hulu and E! are both stations that used to air Keeping Up With The Kardashians before the series concluded this year, and he asserts that his family life is real and not just for people’s entertainment. He also believes that Kim’s publicist is trying to keep them and his family apart. Questions were raised when the Kardashian appeared at the end of Ye’s third Donda listening event in Chicago, wearing what appeared to be a white wedding gown, after the two hadn’t been seen together in months. Ye confirmed in the interview that he and Kim are still technically married, and that he still views her as “his wife.”
The Red Cap Isn’t Going Anywhere Some thought that Ye had undergone some kind of metamorphosis when he disappeared from the public eye after his failed presidential run and pro-life outcry in early 2020, but rest assured, the man behind the mask is still wearing a red cap. During several points of the interview, Ye made it clear that he still “got the red cap on today. I’ll let y’all know that right now.” Despite being heavily criticized for his visits with former-president Donald Trump during his tenure at the White House, Ye still holds a firm conviction against cancel culture and the Democratic Party. He says several times throughout the interview that he can’t be “canceled” at all. “I love it, I’m above it,” Ye says in response to being asked about the criticism he got for bringing DaBaby and Marilyn Manson out with him during his third Donda listening event in Chicago, two artists who were previously believed to be “canceled.” This was followed by disturbing comments about how sexual assault allegations of varying severity are all looked at the same, referring to the several allegations of assault and misconduct against Manson. He Has a Few Hot Takes During “Quicktime with Slime” In a popular Drink Champs segment called “Quicktime with Slime,” N.O.R.E. asks the guest a series of questions where they have to pick between two people about which is better, and if they can’t choose, then they have to take a shot. For this edition, Ye barely drank as he didn’t hold back in choosing which person he thought was better. Among some of his interesting answers, Ye revealed that he believes Just Blaze is a “copycat” who replicated his own production style on most of Jay-Z's 2001 album The Blueprint, that Common is “a thousand times better” than Talib Kweli, and that he’s picking Funkmaster Flex over Kid Capri on the DJ front because of how Flex made “Otis” a legendary song by spinning it back on air 30-plus times. He also revealed that it was Fivio Foriegn’s impressive freestyle fresh out of prison on Hot 97 with Flex that made him want to reach out to get the drill rapper on “Off The Grid,” delivering one of the most memorable features on Donda. He even talked about the current generation of rappers, picking Lil Baby over DaBaby because he believes everyone is trying to rap like him and has a very captivating sound.",2021-11-05T04:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Kanye West Discusses Marilyn Manson, DaBaby, Drake Beef on Drink Champs Podcast: Watch","Ye, the musician formerly known as Kanye West, appeared on the podcast Drink Champs Thursday night (November 4). During the discussion, he discussed a wide range of subjects, including God, politics, the NBA and his relationship with Kobe Bryant, his marriage, Donda, Drake, group chats, thoughts on cancel culture, and much more. Early in the program, he said that he had received only one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, calling himself “halfcinated.” He also returned to the subject of abortion and further expanded on some of his other ideas on spiritual and physical wellness.
Ye said he’d be open to appearing on Verzuz, and said that he’d beat Drake in a face-off. He continued to discuss his ongoing feud with Drake, comparing it to both a basketball rivalry and Mike Tyson’s beef with Evander Holyfield. “I bit his ear,” Ye said, aligning himself with Tyson.
At one point, Ye compared himself to Robin Hood, using that comparison to explain his recent collaboration with Gap. He went on to discuss his other work with Marilyn Manson and DaBaby, saying, “They can’t cancel us all.” Later, he claimed that he had been shadowbanned on Twitter after traveling to Haiti. He detailed his recent experience cutting his own hair, saying it was representative of his thoughts developing.
Ye revived his Sunday Service performances at the end of October with guests Justin Bieber, Marilyn Manson, and Roddy Ricch, having rolled out the record with three stadium listening events. Manson had joined West for the final installment at Chicago’s Soldier Field, which featured a replica of West’s childhood home.

Marilyn Manson abusou de mulheres em uma caixa de vidro à prova de som,"RN Ronayre Nunes
O local tem até nome: ""quarto das meninas más"" - (crédito: LISA O'CONNOR)
Conhecido mundialmente como Marilyn Manson, Brian Warner foi acusado no último domingo (14/11), através de uma série de relatos na revista Rolling Stone, de abusos psicológicos e sexuais contra mulheres. De acordo com a publicação, Manson mantém uma caixa de vidro — à prova de som — dentro do apartamento que tem em Nova York, onde seriam realizados os abusos.
O local tem até nome: “quarto das meninas más”. Segundo relato de uma das mulheres à revista, a caixa era usada para “punir as transgressões"" das parceiras. Ainda de acordo com a ex-namorada, Ashley Morgan Smithline, o cantor a deixava por horas no local, em um ritual semelhante a tortura. “No começo, ele fazia parecer algo legal. Então, ele a fez parecer algo bastante punitivo. Mesmo que eu gritasse, ninguém me ouviria”.
Vale lembrar que Ashley Walters, uma ex-assistente de Manson processa o artista por abuso sexual. De acordo com os autos do processo, Manson “mantinha (a caixa) em um tom de piada, se gabando”.
Entre outros detalhes sobre o local onde fica o objeto, a revista pontua que os móveis são decorados com sangue, suásticas e fotos pornográficas. A pintura do apartamento é toda em preto e as cortinas barram qualquer entrada de luz. Além disso, a publicação lembra que a temperatura do quarto é sempre de 18 graus.
Memória
No dia 1º de fevereiro deste ano, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood usou o Instagram para distribuir uma carta aberta contra Manson. “O nome do meu abusador é Brian Warner, também conhecido como Marilyn Manson. Ele começou a me aliciar quando eu era apenas uma adolescente e abusou horrivelmente de mim durante anos. Fui submetida a uma lavagem cerebral e manipulada até a submissão”, diz trecho da mensagem.

Kanye West Hit With Backlash Over Marilyn Manson At Sunday Service,"The surprise Sunday Service that kicked off on Halloween this past weekend continues to be a topic of debate. Kanye West's Sunday Services were once all the rage, but there seems to have been a bit of a lull in recent months as the rapper prepared for the epic rollout of Donda. On Halloween, West was joined by Justin Bieber and Marilyn Manson as they were all photographed together in prayer, and the shock-rocker's inclusion in Ye's recent dealings have confused the public.
Previously, Manson made an appearance with West and DaBaby at Donda's Chicago listening event. That came amid the ongoing allegations of sexual assault, battery, and rape that Manson is facing from several accusers, including Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco.

Others who have accused the rocker of abuse have been his ex-girlfriend andWestworld actress Evan Rachel Wood in addition to his former assistant. Manson has vehemently denied the claims but his appearances with West have caused the public to question Kanye's intentions, as well as Manson's.
The debates have spurned op-ed think-pieces, TikTok video series', and back and forth spats between social media users across all platforms. We've collected a few reactions regarding the backlash below. West, meanwhile, has not addressed his critics.",2021-11-04T00:04:14Z,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com,HotNewHipHop
Marylin Manson accusé de viol : pourquoi Kanye West et Justin Bieber se retrouvent au coeur de la polémique,"Les internautes ont été très choqués de voir Justin Bieber et Kanye West aux côtés de Marilyn Manson lors d'une cérémonie religieuse, diffusée en direct.
En avril dernier, l'actrice Esmé Bianco dépose plainte contre Marilyn Manson, l'accusant de viol. Une grave accusation qui s'ajoute à celles pour trafic d'être humains et emprisonnement. Mais apparemment, l'artiste peut compter sur le soutien de deux autres chanteurs : Kanye West et Justin Bieber. En effet, les internautes ont été choqués de voir ces derniers rejoindre Marilyn Manson lors d'un office religieux. Diffusée en direct, la cérémonie a vu Justin Bieber interpréter Hurricane avec Kanye West. Celui qui est accusé de plusieurs agressions sexuelles a vu ses péchés pardonnés par les deux chanteurs. ""Nous chassons toute activité démoniaque qui tenterait de voler notre paix aujourd'hui et notre joie"", a été entendue dans la vidéo.
Suite à cette diffusion, Ashley Morgan Smithline qui a elle aussi déposé une plainte contre le chanteur s'est confiée au média People : elle avoue être ""traumatisée"" par la vidéo des trois artistes. ""C'est navrant. Cela me rend malade"". Elle avoue que le voir ainsi mis en scène l'a blessé et a bien évidemment traumatisé les autres victimes présumées de Marylin Manson : ""Cela rend tout le monde vraiment malade. C'est comme être traumatisé à nouveau.Et cela montre simplement que le monde ne se soucie pas vraiment si vous violez et si vous battez et blessez toutes ces femmes, vous pouvez faire ce que vous voulez"", a-t-elle déploré.
Justin Bieber n'aurait pas été pas au courant de la présence de Marilyn Manson
Elle regrette également que Kanye West ait joué le jeu du chanteur : ""Cet homme doit savoir qu'il est aux côtés d'un violeur"". Selon une source, Justin Bieber n'était pas au courant de la présence de Marilyn Manson. ""Tout au long de sa carrière, Marilyn Manson a collaboré avec des artistes innovants et légendaires dans tous les genres musicaux, et Ye ne fait pas exception"", a déclaré le porte-parole de l'artiste.

Justin Bieber y Marilyn Manson participaron en los servicios religiosos de Kanye West,"Los cantantes Justin Bieber y Marilyn Manson acompañaron a Kanye West ‘Ye’ durante uno de sus eventos religiosos y terminaron sorprendiendo a los cibernautas, quienes se preguntan si ahora Manson es cristiano. Usaron atuendos completamente blancos. Además, formaron un círculo de oración y alabanzas.
En las fotos se puede apreciar a los tres artistas durante el acto religioso que viene siendo organizado y realizado por el intérprete de “Flashing lights” desde hace casi tres años, ya que se considera así mismo como un líder religioso o pastor. En esas líneas, sus más recientes lanzamientos musicales, como gran parte de su vida, han estado enfocados en la religión.
El artista organiza conciertos secretos y exclusivos con una escenografía cargada de espiritualidad llamado Sunday service, en el que reinterpretan su música en clave gospel como una auténtica misa. Según una entrevista que dio Kim Kardashian para la revista Elle, su aún esposa estaría principalmente enfocado en la música. “Es una experiencia curativa para él. (…) Es solo música. Es algo en lo que él cree, en Jesús, y hay una atmósfera cristiana. Pero no hay oraciones”, comentó.

¿Marilyn Manson ya no rinde culto a Satán?
El intérprete de “Sweet dreams” fue nombrado como pastor de la iglesia de Satán en 1994, la cual fue fundada en 1966. Esta organización fue creada por Anton Szandor LaVey y, pese al nombre, no venera ni rinde culto al maligno, sino que rechaza la dualidad entre el bien y el mal en el mundo y se posiciona contra el cristianismo considerando a Satanás como una representación de la humanidad.
En esa línea, Brian Warner, nombre real de Manson, nunca se consideró una seguidor de la creencia, solo recibió dicho título por su trabajo artístico. Sin embargo, por esos años se consideró ateo y recientemente reveló que se convirtió en una persona espiritual, tal vez influida por su amistad con ‘Ye’.

Marilyn Manson's ex Ashley Morgan Smithline is speaking out amid his continued embrace in prominent Hollywood circles.
On Halloween, Manson appeared alongside Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and Justin Bieber at the rapper's livestreamed Sunday Service. Images of the three musicians leading a prayer circle quickly began circulating online.
Smithline — who recently filed a lawsuit against Manson containing accusations of sexual assault, human trafficking, and unlawful imprisonment, among other allegations — told People that seeing Manson play a major role in the event felt ""just like being traumatized.""
""It's heartbreaking. It makes me sick,"" she said. ""How is this the world we live in?""
Smithline and Manson met in 2010 and dated for about two years. She publicly accused the singer of sexual, psychological, and physical abuse in February, and previously told People that she ""thought he was going to kill"" her during their relationship. (A spokesperson for Manson told People they ""strongly deny her claims."")
Smithline is one of more than 15 women who have come forward with allegations against Manson. His accusers also include actors Evan Rachel Wood and Esmé Bianco.
""It makes everyone really fucking sick. This is just like being retraumatized,"" Smithline told People. ""And it's just showing the point that the world doesn't really care if you rape and if you beat and hurt all these [women], you can do whatever you want, basically, if you have money and you're a guy and you're famous.""
She also said Manson's accusers are ""terrified for our lives"" while ""he's having lunch in West Hollywood.""
""This man has to know that he is enabling a rapist,"" she added, referring to Ye. ""He's enabling an abuser and not just [of] one girl.""
A spokesperson for Manson told People that he was an ""integral part"" of the Sunday Service, and it's ""nobody's business"" whether the ""Antichrist Superstar"" singer has turned to Christianity.
""Throughout his career, Marilyn Manson has collaborated with innovative and legendary artists across all musical genres, and Ye is no exception,"" the spokesperson told People.
Manson previously appeared alongside Ye at the rapper's ""Donda"" listening party in Chicago. He is also credited as a cowriter on ""Jail, Pt 2,"" the 24th track on Ye's newest album.
Manson is currently being investigated for domestic violence by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. He has denied all accusations of assault and described his past relationships as ""entirely consensual.""

Marilyn Manson e Justin Bieber sul palco assieme a Kanye West,"Il 31 ottobre si è tenuto uno dei ""Sunday Service"" di West/Ye, le sue jam session musicali eseguite con un coro gospel, diversi strumenti e ospiti vari. Stavolta è toccato a Manson (che aveva già partecipato al listening party dell’album “Donda” a Chicago, inonché al disco stesso per la traccia ""Jail 2""), a Bieber e al rapper Roddy Ricch. I 4 hanno anche pregato insieme, scatenando polemiche sui social. Manson, oltre a essere il ""Reverendo"" della Chiesa di Satana, è infatti accusato di abusi da più donne
Il 31 ottobre 2021 si è tenuto uno dei cosiddetti Sunday Service di Kanye West (che oggi ha cambiato legalmente il suo nome in Ye), le sue performance che si propongono come particolari jam session musicali eseguite dall'artista con un coro gospel, diversi strumenti e ospiti vari.
Stavolta è toccato a Marilyn Manson (che aveva già partecipato al listening party dell’album “Donda” a Chicago, nonché al disco stesso, cui ha collaborato per quanto riguarda la traccia ""Jail 2""), a Justin Bieber e al rapper Roddy Ricch, tutti coinvolti da West/Ye nelle esibizioni di brani facenti parte della sua ultima fatica discografica, quel parto lungo e sofferto che è stato battezzato Donda.
Se già la prima ospitata di Marilyn Manson, quella in occasione degli eventi di ascolto del disco, non era piaciuta a parte dell’opinione pubblica, anche questa si aggiunge alla listache fa storcere il naso.
Ma soprattutto non tanto a far storcere il naso ma semmai a fare traboccare il vaso è un particolare di questo Sunday Service targato 31 ottobre: Kanye West, Marilyn Manson, Justin Bieber e Roddy Ricch non si sono limitati a suonare gomito a gomito ma hanno anche pregato insieme.Sì, avete capito bene: pregato.
Questo dettaglio ha scatenato parecchie polemiche sui social network. Il motivo? A parte che Marilyn Manson si definisce dalla notte dei tempi l’Anticristo e che la data era il 31 ottobre, anche conosciuta come notte di Halloween, delle streghe, del diavolo e chi più ne ha più ne metta? A parte tutto questo, uno dei motivi principali è senz’altro legato al fatto che Marilyn Manson è stato accusato di abusi da diverse donne, tra cui Evan Rachel Wood.
Proprio l'attrice si è fatta portavoce per prima di questa accusa, che sarebbe stata poi sollevata anche da altre donne: nel febbraio 2021 Wood - coinvolta in una relazione sentimentale con Manson a più riprese (dal 2007 al 2008 e poi dal 2009 al 2010) - ha denunciato pubblicamente sul suo profilo di Instagram gli abusi che sostiene di aver subito dal cantante durante il periodo in cui stavano assieme.
Dopo la prima apparizione di Marilyn Manson al listening party di Donda, l’attrice ha voluto fare sentire la propria voce, letteralmente: a fine agosto 2021, dopo il listening party di West, ha cantato sul palco della Bourbon Room di Hollywood You Get What You Give, la canzone dei New Radicals che cita Manson. E in maniera eloquente ha voluto alzare il dito medio proprio nel verso dedicato al suo ex compagno, dedicando il brano «alle sopravvissute che questa settimana hanno preso uno schiaffo in faccia».",2021-11-02T11:10:00Z,https://tg24.sky.it,Sky Tg24 
Bizarrer Gottesdienst: Kanye West betet mit Marilyn Manson und Justin Bieber,"Los Angeles -
Mit gemeinsamen Aufnahmen haben die US-Stars Kanye West, Marilyn Manson und Justin Bieber für Empörung gesorgt. Der Rapper, der sich offiziell nun Ye nennt, lud die Musiker Manson und Bieber zu seinem hauseigenen Gottesdienst „Sunday Service“ an Halloween, 31. Oktober, ein. Dass gegen Marilyn Manson Vorwürfe wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs laufen, scheint Kanye West dabei nicht zu stören.
Kanye Wests Gottesdienste sind beliebt bei Promis
Ins Leben gerufen hat der ehemalige Rapper den Gottesdienst anlässlich seines neunten Albums „Jesus is King“ im Januar 2019, berichtet „Buzzfeed“. Obwohl West häufig als sehr christlich und gläubig auftritt, hat der West-Gottesdienst eher etwas von einem Promi-Treffen, die gemeinsam neben Gott auch Musik, Mode und Exklusivität feiern.

So waren auch schon Schauspieler-Größen wie Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom oder Shia LaBeouf genauso wie Sängerin Katy Perry Teil der West-Messe. Das Portal berichtet weiter, dass auch die Prominenten eine Verschwiegenheitserklärung unterzeichnen und sich an einen strikten Dresscode halten müssen. Kritik werfen West Sektentum vor.

Die neusten Gäste nun in dem skurrilen Gottesdienst: Schock-Rocker Marilyn Manson und Teeniestar Justin Bieber. In sozialen Netzwerken kursieren Fotos und Videos, die die Prominenten gemeinsam, ganz in weiß gehüllt, zeigen. Einen gemeinsamen Gebetskreis soll Marilyn Manson sogar geleitet haben, der sich in der Vergangenheit zur „Kirche Satans“ bekannt hatte.
Vorwürfe des sexuellen Missbrauchs an Marilyn Manson
Zu großer Kritik an Gastgeber Kanye West führt, dass die Vorwürfe gegen Marilyn Manson noch nicht geklärt seien. Mehreren Frauen hatten den Musiker schwer belastet. Unter anderem die bekannte Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood („Westworld“, „Kajillionaire“) hatte berichtet, dass Manson sie grausam missbraucht haben soll. Der Musiker stritt die Vorwürfe ab. Wood nannte Manson einen „gefährlichen Mann“.
Dass ausgerechnet ein in der Vergangenheit bekennender Satanist und mit schweren Vorwürfen belasteter Mann die Messe zeitweise geleitet haben soll, brachte Kanye West viel Kritik von Gläubigen ein. Einige Kritiker vermuten hinter dem Zusammentreffen auch eine Promo-Aktion, dies ist aber bislang unbestätigt. (mab/red)",2021-11-02T10:09:41Z,https://www.ksta.de,Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger
Fans sind sauer: Kanye West betet mit Marilyn Manson,"Immer wieder sorgt Kanye West mit merkwürdigen Aktionen für Aufsehen und nicht selten für Ärger. So auch jetzt: Denn dass der Rapper trotz der Vorwürfe gegen Marilyn Manson weiter an der Freundschaft mit dem Schockrocker festhält, stößt vielen Fans sauer auf.
Schon seit Anfang 2019 lädt Kanye West an vielen Sonntagen Familienmitglieder und deren Freunde zur Gospel-Messe ""Sunday Service"" unter freiem Himmel ein. Mit seinem außergewöhnlichen Gottesdienst und der besonderen Musikauswahl erreicht er inzwischen immer mehr Menschen.
Immer wieder sind - neben den eigenen Familienmitgliedern - auch Promis unter den Gästen. Angeblich wurden unter anderem Courtney Love, Katy Perry und Wests mittlerweile verstorbener Rapper-Kollege DMX gesichtet. Auch Hollywood-Star Brad Pitt stattete den Messen bereits zweimal einen Besuch ab.
Mit seinem letzten Gast hat sich Kanye West am vergangenen Sonntag jedoch keinen Gefallen getan. Denn dass er ausgerechnet Marilyn Manson zum ""Sunday Service"" einlud, stößt vielen Fans in den sozialen Medien sauer auf. Mehrere Frauen werfen dem Schockrocker unter anderem Vergewaltigung, häusliche Gewalt und emotionalen Missbrauch vor. Der 52-Jährige streitet die Vorwürfe ab.
""Unglaublich, wie wir Ye immer noch unterstützen""
Fotos zeigen, wie sich Kanye West, Marilyn Manson und Justin Bieber, der ein Gebet ins Mikrofon sprach, in den Armen halten. Dem US-Promiportal ""TMZ"" zufolge stand Manson ganz vorne in der Mitte neben dem Rest des Chors.
""Ich kann nicht glauben, dass wir in einer Zeitlinie leben, in der Kanye West, Justin Bieber und Marilyn Manson in einem Kreis zusammengekauert sind und sich umarmen"", twitterte etwa ein Nutzer. ""Unglaublich, wie wir Ye immer noch unterstützen, indem wir seiner Arbeit zuhören"", schrieb ein anderer.
Die Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen Marilyn Manson scheinen Kanye West jedoch nicht weiter zu stören. Die beiden Musiker sind seit geraumer Zeit miteinander befreundet. Manson ist auch auf Wests neuestem Album ""DONDA"" zu hören, gemeinsam haben sie das Lied ""Jail Pt. 2"" aufgenommen.

Kanye West chama Marilyn Manson para culto e é alvo de críticas,"Reprodução Vídeo/Twitter
O rapper Kanye West, que mudou o nome para Ye, realiza frequentemente cultos religiosos e os encontros geralmente contam com a presença de amigos famosos. No último domingo, 31 de outubro, não foi diferente, porém, a presença de Marilyn Manson acabou gerando críticas por parte do público.
Isto porque a participação do roqueiro no evento religioso do ex-marido da socialite Kim Kardashian ocorre em meio as investigações de várias acusações de abuso sexual contra o artista de 52 anos. Manson e seus advogados negam os crimes. Entre as mulheres que denunciaram os estupros estão as atrizes Evan Rachel Wood, ex-noiva do músico, e Esmé Bianco, ex-namorada dele. Há registros de pelo menos outras 14 mulheres com acusações semelhantes contra o artista.
O culto foi transmitido pelas redes sociais e os internautas começaram a detonar Kanye West. Tanto West quanto seus convidados participaram do culto vestidos de branco.
“Mas que p**** o Marilyn Manson está fazendo nesse culto?”, questionou um internauta.
“Só o Kanye para convidar o Marilyn Manson para um culto…”, lamentou uma pessoa no Twitter.
“Kanye West vai ser conhecido como o cara que converteu o Marilyn Manson”, escreveu outro.

MÁSCARA BIZARRA
Kanye West foi visto se encontrando com o ex- advogado de Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, no bairro do Upper East Side de Nova York, na terça-feira, usando uma estranha máscara. Cohen explicou que eles estavam se reunindo, e que a máscara foi projetada para esconder o rapper de fãs e paparazzi.
“O propósito [da máscara] era para que as pessoas não o reconhecessem… nos primeiros 10 minutos em que nos sentamos, ele foi cercado por pessoas que queriam fotos, e para dizer olá. Então, ele colocou essa máscara para lhe dar algum anonimato, o que, curiosamente, não funcionou de verdade” explicou o advogado ao Page Six.
O candidato a prefeito de Nova York também planejou comparecer ao encontro, mas teve de cancelar. Segundo o CEO da 5WPR, Ronn Torossian, a máscara permitiu a West atravessar Nova York sem a necessidade de segurança. “Ele estava usando a máscara na maior parte do tempo e disse que a estava usando para poder andar livremente. Não havia segurança, ele estava apenas vagando pelas ruas com a máscara. Ele e Michael Cohen estavam conversando sobre imóveis.” explicou também ao Page Six.

Kanye West’s budding friendship with Marilyn Manson continues to flourish.
The “Jesus Walks” rapper invited the shock rocker to join him and pal Justin Bieber for a prayer circle at Sunday Service on Halloween.
The unlikely trio were seen wrapping their arms around each other as they bowed their heads in prayer. They wore head-to-toe white for the religious gathering.
“Thank you for your power, thank you for your grace, thank you for your peace, thank you for your forgiveness,” Bieber, 27, can be heard saying in a clip shared on Twitter as a gospel choir chants behind him.
Meanwhile, Manson, who has been accused by several women of sexual abuse, nodded in agreement. Under his white headpiece, the 52-year-old “Dope Show” singer could be seen wearing his signature white face makeup and black eyeshadow. West, 44, had his eyes closed and his arms in front of his waist.
Manson, Bieber and West put their arms around each other as they pray. Twitter
“Thank you that you never leave us or forsake us,” Bieber continued in the video. “Thank you that we could never be more loved than we are right now in this moment.”
At one point in the nearly 2-minute clip, the “Holy” singer says in a timid tone, “I come against any lies of the enemy, any fear … Your name is above it all. The name of Jesus is above it all. We cast out any demonic activity that would try to steal our peace today or steal our joy.”
A full livestream of the service was featured on Triller and Fite TV, and is available for download for $9.99. West revealed last year that he spent $50 million on Sunday Service in 2019, and faced two class-action lawsuits earlier this year alleging mistreatment of performers and staff.
Bieber, a practicing Christian, led the group prayer and Manson and West bowed their heads. Twitter
This is the first Sunday Service that Manson has attended.
In 2007, the Church of Satan High Priest Peter Gilmore told WikiNews that Manson was a member of their church and had been given “honorary priesthood.”
“When asked about what Satanism is he can be very articulate in explaining it,” the priest said at the time. “But his own music is his own art. His stage shows are his own, and they don’t really exemplify Satanism in particular.”
Gilmore described Satanism in that interview as a “self-centered philosophy,” in which
“you are taking on for yourself the complete onus for your personal success or failure.”
A gospel choir also performed at the special Sunday Service, held on Halloween. Twitter
“You can’t be praying to a God or blaming a devil, or anyone else, for that matter, for what happens to you,” he added.
Manson wrote about his involvement with the Church of Satan in his autobiography, “The Long Hard Road Out of Hell,” according to Rolling Stone.
Since early this year, at least 15 women — including actress Esmé Bianco — have accused the “Personal Jesus” singer of various levels of sexual, psychological and physical abuse. Although his case against Jane Does was dismissed in September, a judge ruled in October to continue proceedings with Bianco’s case.
Manson has denied all allegations. His attorney, Howard King, told Page Six in April that Bianco’s claims “are provably false.”
Amid the onslaught of sexual assault claims, West invited Manson to attend his “Donda” listening party in Chicago back in August, which was met with much criticism.

Fans are baffled after Kanye West invites Marilyn Manson to lead Sunday prayers,"Kanye West, also known as his now-legal name Ye, baffled fans after inviting Marilyn Manson to join his Sunday Service on Halloween – despite his affiliation with Satanism and once being made a minister in the Church of Satan.
In what could be perceived as one of the most unlikely trios, Manson, who is currently facing sexual misconduct and abuse allegations, was invited to join Kanye and devout Christian Justin Bieber on stage to lead a prayer.
The images from Sunday, show attendants dressed in head-to-toe white, some of whom wore masks. The heavy metalist bowed his head during the prayer and was seen touching foreheads with West.
Some have branded the newly-formed friendship between the pair as “odd” after Manson made his first public appearance in August at West’s Donda listening event at Soldier Field. He also featured on West’s track Jail Pt. 2.

Sunday marked the return of the rapper’s religious ceremony. The event is live-streamed to eager fans for $10 (£7.30) through Triller and Fite TV app.
One displeased viewer took to Twitter and said: “Just wasted all my f**king money, kanye forgot the lyrics to come to life and justin bieber has sang more and Marilyn manson is about to cry.”
“You’re telling me Kanye West managed to get Marilyn Manson to become a Christian?” Another said, “Anything’s possible, I suppose, but I wasn’t counting on that particular intersection of words.”
While one tweeted, “I am literally crying because this is so ridiculous. Like what even is this?”
Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood was the first to publicly out Manson in her allegations, which prompted more than 15 other women to step forward, including Phoebe Bridgers, Wolf Alice’s Ellie Rowsell and Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco.

Kanye West faces backlash for welcoming Marilyn Manson to Sunday Service,"Something went wrong, please try again later.

Kanye West may have raised eyebrows again by getting close to controversial musician Marilyn Manson – and invited him to join him at his latest Sunday Service event.
Rap superstar Kanye, 44, already provoked a backlash earlier this year when he welcomed 52-year-old Marilyn on stage during a listening performance of his latest album, Donda, at a stadium in Chicago in August.
Marilyn has been attracting negative headlines in recent months after a number of women made allegations against him of psychological and sexual abuse – claims the American singer has furiously denied.
Perhaps in an effort to beam forgiveness on the embattled rocker, Kanye invited Marilyn to join him and Canadian pop star Justin Bieber, 27, to his Sunday Service over the weekend – with the event falling on Halloween.
(Image: Twitter)
All three men were dressed in white for the event – with Marilyn almost entirely covered in material as white fabric covered his face from the nose down and a hood covered his ears and hairline.
Marilyn — whose real name is Brian Warner and is also an honorary priest in the Church of Satan — stood with his arms outstretched while Kanye delivered a prayer.
The MailOnline reports that Justin also gave a prayer, saying: “We cast out any demonic negativity that would try and steal our peace today or steal our joy.”

Kanye is facing a backlash after he invited Marilyn to join him at the event – having also included the grunge rock star to perform on one of the tracks of his Donda album, called Jail pt 2.
Taking to social media as photos of Kanye, Marilyn and Justin in prayer started to circulate, many fans issued statements of concern and anger.
One tweeted: “I am literally crying because this is so ridiculous. Like what even is this?”

Another person added: “This is scary.”
Another wrote: “Marilyn Manson at Kanye West ’s aka Ye’s Sunday service doesn’t sit right with me..”
And a further concerned fan tweeted: “justin bieber praying alongside Marilyn Manson and Kanye west is so crazy.”
Marilyn has been accused of rape and “further degrading acts” of exploitation and abuse by a string of women including his ex-girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood.
British actress Esmé Bianco has filed a lawsuit accusing the rock star of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse.
Her suit was originally filed in April – and was given approval by a judge last month to proceed.

Esmé – who played Ros in Game of Thrones – has claimed Marilyn chased her with an axe and would play her sex scenes from the HBO show “repeatedly” in an effort to humiliate her.
Marilyn previously hit out at the accusations against him, writing on social media: “these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.
“My intimate relationship have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”",2021-11-01T12:09:38Z,https://www.irishmirror.ie,Irish Mirror

"Marilyn Manson, Justin Bieber, & Kanye West Pray Together At Sunday Service","Earlier today, Kanye West announced the return of Sunday Service via his Instagram page. Fans of the rapper were elated to hear the news, but when they find out who was on the guest list, they may find themselves disappointed. As reported by TMZ, ”Killing Strangers” singer Marilyn Manson was front and centre at the event this afternoon.
Throughout his career, the shock-rocker has been accused of sexual assault by numerous women. That didn’t stop Ye from bringing him out during the rollout of DONDA, and it looks like it won’t stop him from worshiping God with his new friend either.
“Marilyn Manson is currently leading a prayer circle with Justin Bieber and Kanye West,” a tweet posted by @RapDose says. Viewers can see the three artists all dressed in white from head to toe, and everyone in the background appears to be rocking similar ensembles.
The gossip site says that Bieber got on the mic and said a few words while attending Sunday Service, although he kept his hood on and face covered for most of the event, seemingly trying to lay low. Other photos that have made their way onto Twitter show a bald West, now also missing his eyebrows.
While Kanye spends time with his boys, his estranged wife, Kim Kardashian West, has been spending time with Saturday Night Live actor Pete Davidson. The 41-year-old was spotted holding hands with the comedian on a rollercoaster at Knott’s Scary Farm earlier this weekend, while hanging out with Kourtney Kardashian, Travis Barker, and some others.
How do you feel about Ye bringing someone with a reputation like Marilyn Manson’s to a place that’s intended for worship?

Justin Bieber appeared with the Sunday Service Choir for a rooftop performance of Donda songs including “No Child Left Behind,” “Hurricane,” “Moon,” and “Come to Life.” Roddy Ricch performed “Pure Souls.” Marilyn Manson made his second live appearance with Ye this year after the Chicago listening event at Soldier Field. Manson, who also appeared on Donda, is actively facing multiple sexual assault lawsuits. A children’s choir also appeared, assisting for a performance of “Jesus Lord.”
Ye’s new album Donda arrived earlier this year. It debuted at No. 1 with the biggest week for any album released in 2021, although it was unseated from that record by Drake’s Certified Lover Boy one week later. Shortly after the album’s release, Ye claimed it was released without his approval.

Las últimas imágenes de Marilyn Manson, viralizadas casi de forma inmediata en redes sociales, han preocupado y generado memes a partes iguales. Un rostro cambiado, visiblemente afectado por la edad que han suscitado una infinidad de parecidos.
La realidad es que esa fotografía del artista fue tomada en la presentación del disco 'Donda' de Kanye West, hecho por el que fue muy criticado debido a los antecedentes recientes que involucran al autor de 'The Beautiful People'.
Esa imagen se hizo viral solo unas semanas después, aunque no la original sino una retocada por una de las populares aplicaciones de móvil que cambian radicalmente tu rostro. Ahora, Manson se mostraba con arrugas y con un aspecto de señora mayor, lo que propició todo tipo de comparaciones: desde una profesora de instituto hasta la exalcaldesa de Madrid Manuela Carmena.

The same day he lost an appeal to dismiss sexual assault charges against him, Marilyn Manson listed his Los Angeles mansion for sale, asking $1.75 million.
The “Antichrist Superstar” singer’s three-bedroom, three-bathroom Spanish home built in 1926 spans 2,711 square feet. It has a dark architectural aesthetic with beamed ceilings, wrought iron railings, arched windows, barrel ceilings and a spiral staircase, according to Realtor.com.
There is a living room, a dining room, an office, a lounge area and dual owner’s suites with tiled bathrooms and walk-in closets, according to the listing.
The 0.15-acre plot has a patio, gardens and a garage flex space, according to the listing.
Manson, whose name at birth was Brian Warner, bought the house in 2013, according to Realtor.com.

Marilyn Manson: Missbrauchs-Prozess wird fortgesetzt,"So soll der Richter laut ‘Daily Mail‘ begründet haben: „Eine Jury könnte befinden, dass die Auswirkungen von Warners angeblichen skrupellosen Handlungen, wie seine vermeintlichen Drohungen Biancos Sicherheit, Aufenthaltsstatus und Karriere betreffend, noch Jahre nach ihrem letzten Kontakt mit Warner angehalten haben.“ Schauspielerin Esme Bianco sagte danach gegenüber ‘Deadline‘: „Meine Hoffnung ist, dass diese Entscheidung anderen Überlebenden Mut macht, um Gerechtigkeit zu kämpfen, während es den Tätern zeigt, dass sie ihre Opfer nicht zum Schweigen bringen können."" Gegenüber ‘Good Morning America’ hatte sie einmal erklärt, in einem Video von dem Musiker ausgepeitscht worden zu sein: „Er hat mich in seinem Schlafzimmer eingeschlossen, hat mich halbnackt an ein hölzernes Betpult gefesselt und mich mit einer Peitsche geschlagen.“

Marilyn Manson: Gerichts-Schlappe wegen Vergewaltigungs-Klage,"Der US-Musiker Marilyn Manson wollte verhindern, dass eine Vergewaltigungsklage gegen ihn überhaupt vor Gericht kommt. Das Gericht wies den Antrag der Verjährung allerdings ab.
1/8 Marilyn Manson musste vor Gericht eine Schlappe hinnehmen.
2/8 Die «Game of Thrones»-Darstellerin Esmé Bianco hatte eine Klage eingereicht, in dem sie dem Musiker vorwirft, sie misshandelt zu haben.
3/8
7/8 Marilyn Manson argumentierte, die Vorfälle seien schon verjährt. Das Gericht wies den Antrag ab, der Fall kommt vor Gericht.
8/8 Nun hat Manson zwei Wochen Zeit, zu den Vorwürfen Stellung zu nehmen. Danach wird ein Termin für den Prozess definiert.
Jetzt könnte es Marilyn Manson (52) an den Kragen gehen. Das Gericht in Los Angeles entschied, die Schadensersatzklage von Esmé Bianco (39) gegen ihn zuzulassen. Die «Game of Thrones»-Darstellerin wirft ihrem Ex-Freund vor, sie unter Drogen gesetzt und dann körperlich und sexuell missbraucht zu haben.
Die 39-Jährige hatte den Schockrocker im April unter dessen bürgerlichen Name Brian Warner verklagt. Den Inhalt ihrer Klage hatte sie zuvor im «New York Magazine» in einem Interview offengelegt. In diesem nannte sie den Musiker «ein Monster, das mich fast zerstört hat».
Er habe ihr Leben kontrolliert
Bianco war 2011 mit dem Sänger zusammengezogen, nachdem sie die Hauptrolle in dessen Musikvideo «I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies» gespielt hatte. Sie beschrieb, wie Manson die totale Kontrolle über ihr Leben an sich riss. Er habe ihren Terminplan kontrolliert, ihr vorgeschrieben, was sie anziehen soll und wann sie das Apartment verlassen darf.
Bianco: «Er hat mich ohne Einwilligung beim Sex gebissen, mich einmal mit einem Nazi-Messer geschnitten und dann ein Foto meiner Wunden an seine damaligen Assistenten und Bandmitglieder geschickt.» Die Schauspielerin habe sich wie eine Gefangene gefühlt: «Ich wurde nach seinem Gutdünken angefordert und weggeschickt. Auch mit wem ich reden durfte, hat er bestimmt. Ich habe mich im Schrank versteckt, um mit meiner Familie zu telefonieren.» Sie floh im Juni 2011 aus Mansons Appartement und machte mit ihm Schluss, nachdem dieser sie mit einer Axt durch die Wohnung gejagt habe.
Sie postete Bild mit verwundetem Rücken
2019 postete Bianco auf ihrem Instagram ein Foto von ihrem nackten Rücken, der von Schwielen und Wunden überzogen war. Dazu schrieb sie: «Das ist wirklich mein Rücken. Ich wurde im Namen von ‹Kunst› ausgepeitscht und gefilmt. Obwohl seither viele Jahre vergangen sind, leide ich bis heute unter Albträumen und posttraumatischen Stresssyndrom.» Den Namen des Mannes, der sie misshandelt hatte, nannte sie damals noch nicht. Dafür dann aber in ihrer Klage: «Brian Warner hat das mit seiner Peitsche getan.»
Manson hatte vor Gericht beantragt, Biancos Klage wegen Verjährung abzuweisen. Doch der Richter entschied, dass das Trauma der vorgeworfenen Taten bei Bianco noch Jahre später nachgewirkt hat – was eine Verjährungsfrist nach hinten schiebt: «Aufgrund der vorgeworfenen unvorstellbaren Akte ist es wahrscheinlich, dass Bianco auch noch Jahre nach ihrem letzten Kontakt mit Warner um ihre Sicherheit, ihren Immigrationsstatus und ihre Karriere gefürchtet hat». Er ordnete an, dass Manson jetzt 14 Tage Zeit hat, um auf jeden einzelnen Vorwurf von Bianco zu antworten – ehe ein Termin für einen Prozess festgelegt wird.

Wegen Missbrauchs angeklagt: Marilyn Manson erleidet Schlappe vor Gericht,"Marilyn Manson steht unter Verdacht, mehrere Frauen sexuell missbraucht zu haben. Der Schockrocker selbst bestreitet die Vorwürfe - doch ein Gericht lässt eine von seiner Ex-Freundin Esmé Bianco eingereichte Klage nun zu.
Mehrere Frauen werfen Marilyn Manson sexuellen Missbrauch vor. Dazu zählt auch der ""Games of Thrones""-Star Esmé Bianco. Die Schauspielerin reichte Anfang des Jahres Klage gegen den Schockrocker ein. Dessen Anwalt stellte einen Antrag auf Abweisung der Klage. Ein Richter hat dies nun abgelehnt, wie mehrere US-Medien berichten. Die Klage bleibt also weiterhin bestehen.
Manson soll Bianco zwischen 2009 und 2013 mehrmals körperlich, sexuell, psychisch und emotional missbraucht haben. Wie der US-Richter mitteilte, hätten die ""skrupellosen Handlungen"" von Brian Hugh Warner - so der bürgerliche Name des Musikers - auch Jahre nach dem letzten Kontakt der beiden noch Auswirkungen auf das Leben der 39-jährigen Bianco. Dazu gehören etwa die Bedrohung ihrer Sicherheit, ihr Einwanderungsstatus sowie ihre Karriere.
Der Richter wies Manson an, innerhalb von 14 Tagen eine förmliche Antwort auf jede der in der Klage erhobenen Forderungen einzureichen. ""Ich hoffe, dass dieses Urteil andere Überlebende ermutigt, selbst für Gerechtigkeit zu sorgen, während es den Tätern signalisiert, dass sie die Opfer nicht zum Schweigen bringen können"", sagte Bianco in einem Statement.
Manson spricht von ""Verzerrungen der Realität""
Wie es in den Gerichtsunterlagen heißt, soll der 52-Jährige ""bei mehreren Gelegenheiten Drogen, Gewalt und Gewaltandrohungen eingesetzt"" haben, ""um sexuelle Handlungen (...) zu erzwingen"". Er habe Bianco angeblich Medikamente verabreicht und Schlaf und Nahrung entzogen, ""um sie körperlich und geistig zu schwächen und ihre Fähigkeit, sich ihm zu widersetzen, zu verringern"".
Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte im Februar dieses Jahres ""Westworld""-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood, die mehrere Jahre mit Manson liiert gewesen war. Wood hatte auf Instagram behauptet, dass Manson sie ""jahrelang schrecklich missbraucht"" habe. Sie sei ""einer Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und durch Manipulation zur Unterwerfung gebracht"" worden.
Manson wies von Beginn an alle Vorwürfe von sich. In einem Statement teilte er mit: ""Offensichtlich waren mein Leben und meine Kunst lange Zeit Magneten für Kontroversen, aber diese jüngsten Behauptungen über mich sind schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität.""

Marilyn Manson to now face 'Game of Thrones' actor Esme Bianco's sex assault lawsuit,"The sexual assault lawsuit filed by 'Games of Thrones' fame actor Esme Bianco against Marilyn Manson has received a judge's consent to move forward. According to Fox News, judge Fernando L Aenlle-Rocha of the US District Court of California has denied Manson's attempt to have Bianco's claims dismissed based on the statute of limitations, court documents revealed on Thursday.
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, has been ordered by the judge to file a formal answer to each of the claims made in Bianco's lawsuit within 14 days. ""A reasonable jury could find that the effects of Warner's alleged unconscionable acts, including the perceived threat to Plaintiff's safety, immigration status, and career, persisted years after her last contact with Warner,"" Aenlle-Rocha wrote in his court address. Bianco had filed a lawsuit against the shock rocker in April for alleged sexual assault and sexual battery. The court submission came just three months after she publicly accused Manson of physical and psychological abuse that supposedly occurred when Manson cut her torso with a knife and chased her with an axe.
The complaint also alleged that Warner and his former manager violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act when Warner used fraud to bring Bianco to the US, and then allegedly Warner made threats of force and performed violent sexual acts on her to which she did not consent. ""Warner used drugs, force, and threats of force to coerce sexual acts from Bianco on multiple occasions,"" the initial detailed filing said, Deadline reported at the time.
Bianco said she was involved with Manson from 2009 to 2013 and in her original filing, the British-born actress claimed through her attorney Jay Ellwanger, ""Warner raped Bianco in or around May 2011."" In an April statement to Fox News issued through her representative, Bianco said, ""As millions of survivors like myself are painfully aware, our legal system is far from perfect. This is why I co-created the Phoenix Act, a law that gives precious additional healing time to thousands of domestic violence survivors. But while I fight for a more just legal system, I am also pursuing my right to demand my abuser be held to account, using every avenue available to me.""
The actor further continued, ""For far too long my abuser has been left unchecked, enabled by money, fame and an industry that turned a blind eye. Despite the numerous brave women who have spoken out against Marilyn Manson, countless survivors remain silenced, and some of their voices will never be heard. My hope is that by raising mine I will help to stop Brian Warner from shattering any more lives and empower other victims to seek their own small measure of justice."" Just last month, another of Manson's rape accusers, known only as Jane Doe, saw her lawsuit dismissed by California Judge Gregory Keosian after it fell out of the statute of limitations.
The woman sued Manson for alleged rape and sexual battery in Los Angeles back in May and in her complaint claimed she began dating him in 2011 and soon found herself exploited and victimized by Manson. A member of Manson's team who ""strongly"" denied the claims to Fox News at the time maintained last month that while the judge dismissed Jane Doe's complaint, he did, however, give the woman's attorneys 20 days to file a new complaint if they can provide more facts to get around the statute of limitations as she admitted to the court that she repressed her memories, which the lawsuit classifies as ""delayed discovery.""
Furthermore, as per Fox News, Manson has also denied claims that he assaulted a woman at a show in New Hampshire when he allegedly spat on and blew snot on the woman. (ANI)

Esmé Bianco Speaks Out As Marilyn Manson Rape Lawsuit Allowed to Move Forward,"Esmé Bianco has said she hopes her legal action against Marilyn Manson will ""empower"" others to seek justice.

Court filings also revealed Thursday that it took the actress years to realize the extent of the alleged abuse.
The judge dismissed Manson's (real name Brian Warner) request to dismiss Bianco's lawsuit on statute-of-limitations grounds.
The two dated in 2011 after meeting on a music video set. She is one of several women to accuse the shock rocker of abuse.
Bianco has accused Warner of sexual battery, sexual assault and breaches of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.
Per Deadline, the judge wrote that ""a reasonable jury could find that the effects of Warner's alleged unconscionable acts, including the perceived threat to Plaintiff's safety, immigration status, and career, persisted years after her last contact with Warner.""
Manson has been ordered to file a formal answer to each of the claims made in the lawsuit within 14 days.
Speaking after the judge's decision, Bianco released a statement.
""My hope is that this ruling empowers other survivors to pursue justice for themselves while signaling to abusers that they cannot bully victims into silence,"" she said.
Court documents say it took Bianco ""years to understand the extent of Mr. Warner's physical, sexual, psychological, and emotional abuse."" The filing continues: ""Her career suffered due to the deterioration of her mental health caused by Mr. Warner. She deals with complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety, depression, and panic attacks to this day as a result.""
Manson's lawyer Howard E. King had asked for the suit to be dismissed and said that Bianco's claims are ""provably false.""
""To be clear, this suit was only filed after my client refused to be shaken down by Ms. Bianco and her lawyer and give in to their outrageous financial demands based on conduct that simply never occurred. We will vigorously contest these allegations in court and are confident that we will prevail,"" King added.
Manson is also under investigation by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department for multiple domestic abuse allegations.
Another of Manson's exes, Evan Rachel Wood, has accused him of ""horrific abuse.""
Manson has denied all allegations against him. He released a statement in early 2021 reading: ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how—and why —others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""",2021-10-08T11:59:05Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek

A federal judge in California on Thursday shot down Marilyn Manson's efforts to dismiss a lawsuit from ""Game of Thrones"" actress Esmé Bianco.
The actress has accused the shock rocker, whose real name is Brian Warner, of sexual assault and battery on multiple occasions between 2009 and 2013.
Bianco's lawsuit also accused Warner of violating human trafficking laws in 2009 by flying her to Los Angeles for a purported work opportunity. Instead, she alleged Warner spent four days subjecting her to sleep deprivation, beating her, threatening her, and trying to force her to perform sexual acts on camera.
""One day, Warner locked [Bianco] in a bedroom, tied her to a prayer kneeler, beat her with a whip that he said was utilized by Nazis, and electrocuted her,"" the lawsuit said.
Bianco's lawsuit also said she lived with Warner in 2011 for several months, during which she alleges he deprived her of sleep, cut her with a Nazi knife during sex, sexually assaulted her when she was unconscious or incapacitated, chased her with an axe, and smashed holes in the walls.
Warner's attorney, John Snow, did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the judge's ruling.

Bianco is one of many women who have come forward publicly to accuse Warner of sexual and physical abuse. The actress Evan Rachel Wood has alleged that Warner ""horrifically"" abused her when they were dating between 2007 and 2010, and Warner's former assistant, Ashley Walters, has also sued him, alleging sexual assault, battery, and harassment.

Warner had sought to dismiss Bianco's lawsuit in July, on grounds that her allegations were past California's statute of limitations. Judge Fernando Aenlle-Rocha disagreed.

Esmé Bianco’s Rape & Abuse Suit Against Marilyn Manson Can Proceed,"UPDATED, 4:30 PM: A U.S. District Court Judge is allowing former Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco’s lawsuit against Brian Warner, aka Marilyn Manson, to proceed.
Manson’s legal team attempted to dismiss Bianco’s lawsuit on statute-of-limitations grounds. The lawsuit, originally filed by Bianco and attorney Jay Ellwanger in April 2021, alleges that on multiple instances Warner physically, sexually, psychologically, and emotionally abused Bianco.
The judge wrote that “a reasonable jury could find that the effects of Warner’s alleged unconscionable acts, including the perceived threat to Plaintiff’s safety, immigration status, and career, persisted years after her last contact with Warner,” and ordered Warner to file a formal answer to each of the claims made in the lawsuit within fourteen days.
“My hope is that this ruling empowers other survivors to pursue justice for themselves while signaling to abusers that they cannot bully victims into silence,” said Bianco in a statement.
UPDATED with latest: Marilyn Manson has responded to a lawsuit filed by Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco today accusing the shock rocker of sexual assault and sexual battery.
Manson — whose real name is Brian Warner — spoke through an attorney, Howard E. King, who said the allegations have no merit.
“These claims are provably false,” King said in a statement. “To be clear, this suit was only filed after my client refused to be shaken down by Ms. Bianco and her lawyer and give in to their outrageous financial demands based on conduct that simply never occurred. We will vigorously contest these allegations in court and are confident that we will prevail.”
PREVIOUSLY on Friday: Three months after publicly accusing Marilyn Manson of physical and psychological abuse, Game of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco today has sued the shock rocker for sexual assault and sexual battery.
“Mr. Warner used drugs, force, and threats of force to coerce sexual acts from Ms.
Bianco on multiple occasions,” states the detailed complaint filed in federal court in California by the actress who was involved with Manson AKA Brian Warner from 2009 to around 2013. “Mr. Warner raped Ms. Bianco in or around May 2011,’ the jury trial seeking filing adds (read it here).
“Ms. Bianco was well aware of the violence Mr. Warner could dole out if she fought back, having been on the receiving end of his temper many times,” continues the 10-page document from attorney Jay D. Ellwanger on behalf of the British-born Bianco. “He also supplied drugs to Ms. Bianco and deprived her of sleep and food in order to weaken her physically and mentally and decrease her ability to refuse him. Mr. Warner committed sexual acts with Ms. Bianco when she was unconscious or otherwise unable to consent.”
The complaint also names Manson’s ex-manager as a defendant.
Tony Ciulla and his self-titled company are accused of violating human trafficking laws because they flew her from the UK to LA in 2007 and 2011 with promises of work in an unreleased music video and unmade film. Bianco additionally alleges she was forced to perform “unpaid labor” by Manson. That work included “serving and preparing food for Mr. Warner and his guests, cleaning his apartment, consulting on his album, providing uncredited backup vocals during the creative process for the album Born Villain, and being offered up to his guests and bandmates to ‘spank,'” the suit says.
Bianco is asking for wide-ranging damages from the court.
Reps for Manson nor Ciulla did not respond to requests for comment from Deadline. Manson is currently under investigation by the LA Sheriff’s department for multiple domestic abuse allegations from approximately half-a-dozen women, and maybe more.
“It took Ms. Bianco years to understand the extent of Mr. Warner’s physical, sexual,
psychological, and emotional abuse,” today’s filing says. “Her career suffered due to the deterioration of her mental health caused by Mr. Warner. She deals with complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety, depression, and panic attacks to this day as a result.”
Magicians alum Bianco has been a major proponent along with another ex of Manson’s, Evan Rachel Wood, of California’s Phoenix Act, which extended the Golden State’s statute of limitations on domestic violence by five years. The Phoenix Act became law last year.
Manson was dropped by CAA, his label and roles in Starz’s American Gods and Shudder’s Creepshow in early February after Wood detailed her own wretched experiences with the “Beautiful People” singer. Taking to social media at the time, Wood wrote that the now 52-year old Manson “horrifically” abused her when they were together. The Westworld actress and anti-domestic violence activist also stated that Manson was systematically “grooming” her when she was still a teenager. “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission,” revealed Wood. “I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander or blackmail.”
Manson, at the time, denied the allegations.

Marilyn Manson: la singular razón por la que el cantante fue tendencia en las últimas horas,"Una vez más el nombre del cantante Marilyn Manson es tendencia en redes sociales. Esta vez no se trata de una polémica o problemas con la justicia, sino que fue gracias a la creatividad de miles de internautas que gracias a una fotografía y un filtro produjeron una ola de memes.
Como se recuerda, lel polémico cantante de rock fue demandado por abuso sexual, la denuncia fue interpuesta por su ex pareja Evan Rachel Wood. Ella relató la violencia y la relación de abuso que existía cuando aún eran pareja.
Tras este escándalo, Manson ha tenido breves apariciones públicas y cada vez con menos maquillaje, lo cual ha sido característica suya por años. Una de sus fotos más recientes fue retocada por un internauta con la ayuda de un filtro de envejecimiento. Esto desató los memes sobre el posible futuro del artista.
Específicamente en Twitter —el epicentro de la actividad— los memes y bromas fueron en relación a que el cantante podría tener un un futuro ‘look’ bastante lejano a su habitual caracterización. Según los usuarios —tras ver la foto trucada por el filtro— el intérprete de “Beautiful people” tendría un fuerte parecido con algunos personajes mucho mayores que él.
Manson —hoy de 52 años de edad— fue comparado con Manuela Carmena, Manuel Zaragoza, Phyllis de “The Office”, el cantante español Ramoncín, entre otros.

The clips have been posted to Instagram by DJ Akademiks from photographer Onda's IG Story and show West dressed in a balaclava and a button-up shirt that seemed to show his controversial collaborator's face.
Marilyn Manson—real name Brian Warner—collaborated on Donda this summer in a move that was heavily criticized by music fans as the shock rocker is currently under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for alleged domestic violence incidents.
Manson and DaBaby were brought on stage by West at the rapper's Chicago listening party back in August, in a move that was heavily criticized on social media.
The ""Tainted Love"" singer is facing multiple allegations of sexual, physical and emotional abuse from his former partners including Westworld actress Evan Rachel Wood and Esmé Bianco from Game of Thrones.

""I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail,"" Wood wrote in an Instagram post about her experience with the singer. ""I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""
Manson has denied all allegations against him.
The latest development in the case came on September 15 when a Los Angeles judge dismissed a lawsuit from a woman who accused Manson of raping and threatening to kill her in 2011.
The judge said that the initial allegations were ""not sufficient to invoke the delayed discovery rule."" (per music website Pitchfork.)
The woman, identified as Jane Doe, had 20 days to amend the filings with other details. She has since refiled the lawsuit.
Manson is facing a spate of sexual assault and battery allegations from numerous women.
In April, the actress Esmé Bianco of Game of Thrones fame sued Manson for sexual assault and sexual battery.
Then in May, a former assistant of the singer sued him for sexual assault, battery, and harassment. The next month saw Manson again sued by model Ashley Morgan Smithline for sexual assault, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and unlawful imprisonment.
""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,"" Manson said in a statement on Instagram in February. ""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how—and why—others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""",2021-09-27T08:52:32Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
This Marilyn Manson Song Is Supposed to Sound Like Elvis Presley,"Marilyn Manson and Elvis Presley made very different songs. Despite this, a musician who worked with Manson said one of his songs had an Elvis vibe. He also said the song was similar to the work of another classic rock star.

Marilyn Manson really embraced this instrument on some of his songs
Manson is most known for making shock rock and industrial rock. In more recent years, he started taking influence from other genres like blues and country music. For example, he collaborated with country musician Shooter Jennings to craft his self-titled band’s album We Are Chaos.
During an interview with Guitar World, Jennings discussed We Are Chaos‘ relationship with the acoustic guitar. “I wrote the demo for ‘Don’t Chase the Dead’ on acoustic, and then when we cut it, it became electric,” he said. But on certain songs the acoustic was used to add layers, to add steps to it. But then on ‘We Are Chaos,’ that was a Nashville-stringed acoustic that I played doubled.”

Jennings further discussed the title track of We Are Chaos. “On that song we were going for that glimmery, not quite 12-string — it’s like that movie Tropic Thunder, you never go full 12-string!” he said. “But the Nashville tuning kind of adds that Jeff Lynne vibe.”
He explained why he used the acoustic guitar on “We Are Chaos.” “It was brought in to bring that Elvis meets Jeff Lynne vibe,” he said. “Nashville tuning gives you the glimmer but you don’t have that whole f****** hippy, ’60s peace thing going on. Otherwise, it was this Gibson Hummingbird that was on everything, and really I feel it greased the wheel.” For context, Lynne is a member of the Electric Light Orchestra who produced songs for George Harrison’s solo career and The Beatles’ Anthology albums. Notably, Lynne’s music is very distinct from Elvis’.

Manson was never an extremely mainstream artist, so “We Are Chaos” was a modest hit, if that. The track reached No. 8 on Billboard’s Mainstream Rock Airplay chart, staying on the chart for 17 weeks. It did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100. We Are Chaos was more successful, peaking at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, remaining on the chart for two weeks.
The Official Charts Company reports the song did not chart in the United Kingdom. None of Manson’s songs have charted in the U.K. since “Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand)” in 2007. On the other hand, We Are Chaos reached No. 7 in the U.K., staying on the chart for three weeks.
While the song “We Are Chaos” did not become a famous song, Jennings said it had a “vibe” similar to the music of two very famous artists.",2021-09-27T01:04:51Z,https://www.cheatsheet.com,Showbiz Cheat Sheet
Marilyn Manson Accuser Refiles Lawsuit After Judge Dismisses It: Report,"Just when Marilyn Manson thought he had one case behind him, his accusers has decided to refile. The shock-rocker has been hit with legal blows in recent months as several women have come forward with allegations of sexual abuse and assault. An actress from Game of Thrones and an ex-assistant are just two women who have filed lawsuits against him, and amid the scandal, Manson has denied the allegations.
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners,"" Manson wrote in a statement he uploaded to social media back in February. ""Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
Last week, we reported on one of Manson's accusers having her lawsuit dismissed due to the statute of limitations, and today (September 24), Pitchfork reported that she has refiled her claim.
The revived complaint was filed today (September 23), and contains new details about the alleged assault and alleged incidents that followed. According to court documents, Jane Doe alleges that Manson told her he would “bash her head in” if she reported the alleged assault to authorities. The refiled suit also states that Jane Doe should qualify for the delayed discovery rule due to the fact that she initially repressed memories of the alleged assault.
While he continues to be under investigation in Los Angeles, Manson also faces charges in New Hampshire in connection to an altercation that allegedly took place at a 2019 concert. Read Manson's February statement below.

Marilyn Manson Accuser Refiles Complaint After Judge's Dismissal,"One of Marilyn Manson’s former partners, known only as ""Jane Doe,"" on Thursday (Sept. 23) refiled a complaint against the singer for allegedly raping and torturing her in 2011. The accuser’s initial complaint was dismissed by California Superior Court Judge Gregory Keosian on Sept. 15. The judge had stated that the accuser's claims of repressed memories were “not sufficient” to overrule the two-year statute of limitations.
In the complaint, the accuser claims that for 10 years, she repressed memories of being raped by Manson -- real name Brian Warner -- and only recovered the memories when she was confronted in February 2021 when other women stepped forward with accusations. While the judge stated that the claim of repressed memories ""is common for sexual assault victims,"" he ruled that more was needed to invoke California’s so-called “delayed-discovery” rule, which effectively postpones the start date of the statute of limitations if the plaintiff can prove that they first became aware of the injury within two years of filing their complaint, regardless of when the incident itself took place.
The judge's Sept. 15 ruling stated that the original “complaint alleges neither when the repression began -- such as immediately after the events took place, or outside the limitations period -- nor its nature or extent, such as what memories were repressed or the extent to which Plaintiff was prevented from recalling them.” The judge gave her 20 days from the ruling to amend and refile her complaint.",2021-09-24T04:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Sexual Assault Lawsuit Against Marilyn Manson Refiled After Judge’s Dismissal,"Note: This article contains discusses alleged sexual assault.
On September 15, a Los Angeles judge dismissed a lawsuit from a woman who accused Marilyn Manson of raping and threatening to kill her in 2011. The judge argued that the initial allegations were “not sufficient to invoke the delayed discovery rule,” and that the woman, identified as Jane Doe, had 20 days to amend the filing with new details. Now, Jane Doe has refiled the suit, as Rolling Stone reports. According to RS, the revived complaint was filed today (September 23), and contains new details about the alleged assault and alleged incidents that followed. Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Jane Doe and Marilyn Manson for further comment.
According to documents viewed by RS, Jane Doe alleges that Manson told her he would “bash her head in” if she reported the alleged assault to authorities. The refiled suit also reportedly states that Jane Doe should qualify for the delayed discovery rule due to the fact that she initially repressed memories of the alleged assault.
The original complaint was filed in May of this year. It is one of multiple lawsuits that have been brought against Manson recently. In April, the actress Esmé Bianco sued Manson for sexual assault and sexual battery. In mid-May, a former assistant of the singer sued him for sexual assault, battery, and harassment. In June, Manson was sued by model Ashley Morgan Smithline for sexual assault, sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and unlawful imprisonment. He was also named an alleged abuser by the actress Evan Rachel Wood earlier this year.
Manson is currently under investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department for allegations of domestic violence incidents that fell between 2009 and 2011. This month, Manson pleaded not guilty in New Hampshire on two counts of Class A misdemeanor Simple Assault, stemming from an alleged incident during a 2019 concert.

Μέριλιν Μάνσον: Απορρίφθηκε η πρώτη μήνυση για βιασμό λόγω παραγραφής,"Μία από τις πολλές περιπτώσεις καταγγελιών για βιασμό και κακοποίηση κατά του Marilyn Manson, δεν θα προχωρήσει στο δικαστήριο, αφού ο δικαστής θεώρησε ότι τα όποια αδικήματα έχουν παραγραφεί.
H μήνυση κατατέθηκε τον Μάιο, από γυναίκα που δεν δημοσιοποίησε το όνομα της και υποστήριξε ότι o Manson τη βίασε κάποια στιγμή το 2011 και ενώ είχαν ήδη σχέση. Τόνισε στο δικαστήριο ότι είχε καταπιέσει τις αναμνήσεις και αυτός ήταν ο λόγος που δεν είχε καταγγείλει το περιστατικό νωρίτερα.
Ο δικαστής έδωσε στη γυναίκα 20 ημέρες περιθώριο για να δώσει λεπτομέρειες για την καταπίεση των αναμνήσεων, αλλά τελικά κατέληξε ότι η υπόθεση δεν έχει βάση για να συνεχιστεί λόγω του του μεγάλου χρονικού διαστήματος που έχει περάσει.
Ο Manson έχει πολλά ανοιχτά μέτωπα, με μηνύσεις για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση και βιασμούς ενώ από τη στιγμή που ξεκίνησαν οι καταγγελίες έμεινε χωρίς δισκογραφική εταιρεία και μάνατζερ, ενώ κόπηκαν οι προγραμματισμένες εμφανίσεις του σε τηλεοπτικές σειρές.
Πρόσφατα πάντως έκανε την επανεμφάνιση του σε event για την κυκλοφορία του νέου άλμπουμ του Kanye West, ενώ συμμετέχει και σε ένα τραγούδι.

Marilyn Manson’s sexual abuse case dismissed by California court,"Marilyn Manson’s sexual abuse lawsuit has been dismissed, after the goth rocker’s lawyers discovered a legal loophole.
A California judge has dismissed a woman’s sexual abuse case against Marilyn Manson because the claims have come past the statute of limitations, according to reports.
The unnamed accuser – listed as “Jane Doe” in court documents – claimed the goth rocker, 52, raped and physically abused her throughout their relationship.
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Gregory Keosian said at a hearing on Tuesday that her accusations had expired due to issues related to the statute of limitations, according to People.
Judge Keosian said that the complaint by the accuser, who said her memories of the alleged 2011 attack were “repressed,” does not make clear “when the repression began – such as immediately after the events took place, or outside the limitations period – nor its nature or extent,” according to People.

He gave the woman 20 days to clarify their claims – and the accuser’s lawyers told Page Six on Thursday that their client plans to file an amendment they hope will allow the case to proceeded.
In court documents obtained byPage Six, Manson – whose real name is Brian Warner – filed a request on September 9 to have the case dismissed, claiming the plaintiff’s claims were “barred by the statute of limitations”.
The defendant had requested at the time a jury trial, per court records. The initial complaint was filed in May 2021.
Court records showed that Manson said in his September 9 request that he was willing to participate in mediation and a settlement conference. However, he objected to his accuser continuing to proceed anonymously as “Jane Doe”.
According to People, the unnamed accuser claims Manson raped and sexually abused her multiple times during their relationship in 2011, but said she had “repressed” her memories until other women spoke out.
In February, actress Evan Rachel Wood, who was briefly engaged to Manson in 2010 before calling it quits, alleged he had abused her.
At least 15 other women – including actress Esmé Bianco – have since also accused The Dope Show singer of various levels of sexual, psychological and physical abuse.
Manson’s lawyer Howard King told Page Six in April that Bianco’s allegations “are provably false”. They have also denied all accusations of sexual assault and Manson has not been charged with any crime connected to the alleged incidents.

According to NBC, in the case of Jane Doe, she has 20 days to amend and file a new complaint if her lawyers can provide more facts to get around the statute of limitations.
Her lawyers told Page Six in a statement on Thursday: “Marilyn Manson wants to silence our client about her rape. He tried to use technical legal arguments to get her case thrown out altogether.
“The judge thoughtfully analysed the case law, and rightfully held that her case can go forward, so long as she amends her complaint to add some additional details,” the lawyer said. “We intend to amend with those additional details very shortly, and look forward to the opportunity to make Manson answer for his actions.”
Manson’s lawyers did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Marilyn Manson: Judge dismisses ex-girlfriend's lawsuit accusing star of rape and physical abuse,"A judge in California has dismissed a lawsuit from one of Marilyn Manson's ex-girlfriends, who accused him of raping and physically abusing her during their relationship.
At a hearing on Tuesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Gregory Keosian ruled that the statute of limitations - the time limit for charges to be filed - on the woman's claims had expired.
The woman, referred to as ""Jane Doe"", said the abuse started in 2011 and that repressed memories kept her from reporting it earlier.

In her lawsuit, Jane Doe also accused the musician of raping her, denying her food and demanding ""extremely frequent sex"".

Vergewaltigungsklage gegen Marilyn Manson abgewiesen
16.09.2021, 20:16 Uhr | mbo, t-online
Mehrere Frauen werfen Marilyn Manson sexuellen Missbrauch. Das Gericht hat eine Klage gegen den Schockrocker jetzt jedoch zurückgewiesen und legt auch die Gründe dafür offen.
Im Mai wurde Marylin Manson von ""Game of Thrones""-Star Esmé Bianco verklagt, mit der er einst liiert war. Sie wirft ihm sexuelle Übergriffe und Missbrauch vor. Schon vor und auch nach ihr hatten weitere Frauen dem Musiker Vergewaltigungsvorwürfe gemacht und Klagen eingereicht. Nun hat das Gericht in Los Angeles eine Klage abgewiesen, dies berichten das US-Magazin ""TMZ"" und ""NBC News"" übereinstimmend.
Demnach gehe aus juristischen Dokumenten hervor, dass Richter Gregory Keosian vom Los Angeles County Superior Court die Klage abgewiesen habe, weil die Ansprüche der nicht namentlich genannten Frau inzwischen verjährt seien. Die Klägerin habe erklärt, den Missbrauch durch den Musiker, der sich ab 2011 ereignet habe, verdrängt und deshalb nicht früher zur Anzeige habe bringen können.
Möglichkeit, weitere Fakten vorzulegen
Die Frau habe nun 20 Tage Zeit, erneut Klage einzureichen. Dann müssen dem Gericht jedoch weitere Fakten und Details vorgelegt werden, um die nun genannte Verjährungsfrist zu umgehen.
Die nicht namentlich genannte Klägerin ist eine von drei Frauen, die Manson wegen sexuellem Missbrauchs angezeigt hat. Unter anderem eben auch Esmé Bianco. Sie sei zwischen 2009 und 2013 mehrfach von Brian Warner, wie der Sänger mit bürgerlichem Namen heißt, missbraucht worden, heißt es in einer Klage vom April. Seine ehemalige Assistentin Ashley Walters hat im Mai Vorwürfe der sexuellen Ausbeutung und des psychischen Missbrauchs erhoben. Im Juni folgte eine Klage von Model Ashley Morgan Smithline gegen den Gothrocker. Manson hat bislang alle Vorwürfe abgestritten.
Begonnen hatte die Welle der Klagen und Vorwürfe gegen Marilyn Manson übrigens im Februar 2021 als seine Ex-Freundin, die Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood, auf Instagram behauptete, ""jahrelang schrecklich [von ihm] missbraucht"" worden zu sein und Vorwürfe der Gehirnwäsche und Manipulation erhob.",2021-09-16T18:40:00Z,https://www.t-online.de,t-online.de

A member of Manson's team strongly denied the allegations made in the suit.
In June, California police arrested the musician after he surrendered on an outstanding New Hampshire warrant. The warrant stemmed from a 2019 incident at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion involving a videographer, police said. Manson was performing a concert at the venue on Aug. 18, 2019, when an alleged assault occurred, according to authorities.
Gilford, New Hampshire, police said in May that the arrest warrant on two counts of misdemeanor assault was issued in October 2019 and that Manson had ""been aware of the warrant for some time.""
Manson was processed and released on ""personal recognizance bail"" and other conditions, among them that he have no contact with the alleged victim, Police Chief Anthony J. Bean Burpee said in a statement.
An attorney for Manson called the claim ""ludicrous"" but said they are committed to cooperating with authorities.
Last month, the singer made an appearance at Kanye's listening party for his new album, ""Donda."" It wasn't immediately clear why he was invited on stage, but a representative for Manson previously told NBC News his voice is featured on Donda, ""and he will continue to conceptually collaborate with Ye on the Donda project.""",2021-09-16T12:47:56Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News

Korn to replace Faith No More on System of a Down tour Korn to join SOAD tour Photo: All rights reserved. Korn perform live at Manchester Arena
Photo: Sakura/WENN.com Korn have stepped in to replace Faith No More for System of a Down's upcoming U.S. tour.
On Tuesday (14Sep21), Mike Patton's group canceled a string of 2021 shows, including a run of five concerts with System of a Down, to allow the singer to take time to focus on a number of pandemic-related mental health issues.
And Korn, who have recently battled a trio of COVID cases that prompted them to postpone shows, have agreed to step in for the concerts next month (Oct21).
The two bands will be joined by Russian Circles and Helmet for select dates.

Photo: Sheri Determan/WENN.com A judge has tossed a lawsuit filed by one of Marilyn Manson's rape accusers.
The unnamed woman won't get her day in court with the rocker, according to TMZ, because the lawmaker ruled the statute of limitations had passed on her claims.
The accuser sued the Rock Is Dead singer back in May (21), claiming he raped her while they were dating a decade ago.
She claimed she repressed her memories of the alleged rape but the judge dismissed the suit because the accuser couldn't specify how her memory was repressed.
The woman, identified in court as Jane Doe, has been given 20 days to refile her complaint and address the judge's concerns about her allegedly repressed memories and the statute of limitations.
Manson is also being sued for sexual assault by three other women, including another former girlfriend, Game of Thrones star Esme Bianco, and an ex-assistant.

Nicki Minaj's COVID vaccine impotency claims slammed by British Prime Minister PM bashes Nicki's story Photo: All rights reserved. Nicki Minaj Nicki Minaj's story about a man who became impotent after getting his COVID jab has been slammed by U.K. leader Boris Johnson and American vaccine czar Dr. Anthony Fauci.
Nicki revealed on Monday that she had contracted the deadly disease after refusing to get vaccinated.
In a series of tweets, she made a couple of controversial statements, revealing a cousin's friend in Trinidad is now impotent and has ""swollen testicles"" after being vaccinated.
She added the man was ""weeks away from getting married"" and now his girlfriend has ""called off the wedding.""
Nicki wrote: ""So just pray on it & make sure you're comfortable with ur decision, not bullied.""
Among those ridiculing her claims were the British Prime Minister, who addressed the unsubstantiated story during his Tuesday press conference.
""I'm not as familiar with the works of Nicki Minaj as I probably should be, but I'm familiar with Nikki Kanani, superstar GP (doctor) of (London borough) Bexley, who has appeared many times before you, who will tell you that vaccines are wonderful and everybody should get them.
""So I prefer to listen to Nikki Kanani.""
The U.K.'s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, told the press members, ""There are a number of myths that fly around, some of which are just clearly ridiculous and some of which are clearly designed just to scare. That happens to be one of them.""
On Tuesday, top U.S. COVID expert Anthony Fauci also dismissed the rapper's take on Tuesday as misinformation.
When asked by CNN's Jake Tapper if the vaccines lead to impotency in men, Fauci said, ""The answer to that is a resounding no. There's no evidence that it happens.""
He added, ""She should be thinking twice about propagating information that has no (scientific) basis, except as a one-off anecdote. That's not how science works.""
Despite her initial anti-vax stance, Nicki admitted on Monday she will likely get her shots so she can tour safely.
She polled her followers on Twitter after asking them which vaccine they thought she should get, with Pfizer - so far, the only version approved by the U.S.'s Federal Drug Administration - coming out on top.

Branson - who appeared on U.S. morning show Today on Tuesday to chat about his new cruise line, Virgin Voyages, which is launching in October - seemed unconcerned about the investigation into his July 11 space mission by chiefs at America's Federal Aviation Administration.
The music mogul insisted the historic launch ""couldn't have gone better"", despite the ""tiny"" error, which agency bosses are now looking into.
Earlier this month, chiefs at the governmental agency issued a statement about their investigation into the trip, revealing Branson and his Virgin Galactic colleagues are currently barred from organising further space flights.
""It was a test flight. As far as I was concerned, it just couldn't have gone better,"" Branson said.
""It felt like it went straight up into space. Sometime later, I learned it went a tiny bit out of the designated area, but still over desert,"" he explained of the voyage, which launched from New Mexico. ""It wasn't over any cities or anything like that, and it was only for a minute.""
And the space snafu isn't the only current headache for the British business leader.
Last week, Virgin Galactic officials announced they had pushed back their second mission ""out of an abundance of caution"" because of a possible manufacturing defect that might affect its VSS Unity space plane.
The second launch - originally scheduled for late September - is now expected to blast off in mid-October, according to company officials.

Flav spoke to TMZ.com overnight and insisted in the video that he's ""not the hold up of this Public Enemy project"". Instead, he suggested Chuck's failure to sign a ""partnership agreement"" is what's preventing them from getting back on the road.
However, Chuck - real name Carlton Ridenhour - has now hit back in a statement via his publicist, as he labeled Flav's allegations ""tired and stupid"".
""Flav sues the folks he works with, so in 2017 he decided it was my turn,"" he said. ""He lost when the judge dismissed the suit with prejudice in 2020, which means it's permanent. Over. He can't file again. He lost.
""Even after all of this, even after all the years of Flav giving the situation minimum while always asking for the maximum, I still work with him. But it's time to change. Everybody in the situation can't be burdened with picking up his slack.""
He added: ""The key word in 'Brothers Gonna Work It Out' is the word 'work'. We're always gonna be brothers regardless, but Flav's gotta do the work and there ain't no getting down without the work. Simple as that.""

"Marilyn Manson Rape, Assault Lawsuit By Ex-Girlfriend Tossed By Judge","UPDATE: A woman who accused rocker Marilyn Manson of rape has had her lawsuit tossed out of court.
The lawsuit was dismissed Tuesday because the statute of limitations had passed on the woman’s claims, TMZ reported.
The lawsuit dates to May, when the woman – identified only as “Jane Doe” in legal papers – said the rape happened after she and Manson started dating in 2011. She claimed repressed memories of the incident stopped her from reporting the incident then.
The judge was skeptical of the claim, but gave the woman 20 days to refile the complaint and address concerns over the repressed memories claim.
EARLIER: Rocker Marilyn Manson has more legal troubles on his plate. A lawsuit has been filed by an ex-girlfriend in Los Angeles County state Superior Court, claiming he raped her and forced her to watch a gruesome film depicting abuse of a groupie.
The lawsuit was filed by a “Jane Doe,” who claims she started dating Manson, aka Brian Warner, in 2011.

In its most sensational claim, the lawsuit contends Manson showed her a video he kept locked in a safe. The video allegedly depicted abuse of a groupie after a 1996 appearance by the band at the Hollywood Bowl. The young fan is allegedly forced to drink urine, was threatened with a gun, and may have been pistol-whipped.

TMZ reported that a source claims the video is actually a scripted short film intended for a project that was shelved.The film, the woman claimed in the legal documents, left her afraid for her life.But when she went to return a key to Manson’s home, she alleges he forcibly raped her and threatened to kill her.
The Jane Doe lawsuit asks for damages and a declaration that the Manson conduct broke the law.

Judge Dismisses One Marilyn Manson Sexual Assault Lawsuit,"Photo: Leon Bennett/WireImage
One of the four sexual assault lawsuits against Marilyn Manson has been dismissed, per Pitchfork. The suit, from an ex-girlfriend of Manson who was only identified as Jane Doe, alleged that Manson raped and threatened to kill her. A judge ruled the allegations were not “sufficient to invoke the delayed discovery rule.” Jane Doe has 20 days to amend the lawsuit with additional details, which could reverse the ruling.
Three other lawsuits against Manson remain: one from a former assistant claiming sexual battery, one from actress Esmé Bianco for sexual assault and sexual battery, and one from Ashley Morgan Smithline for “abuse, sexual violence, physical violence, and coercion.” Evan Rachel Wood also named Manson as her abuser earlier this year. Manson’s lawyer filed documents in July claiming that these multiple allegations are part of a conspiracy “cynically and dishonestly seeking to monetize and exploit the Me Too movement.” At the start of this month, Manson pleaded not guilty to two counts of Class A misdemeanor Simple Assault in New Hampsire, relating to the alleged assault of a videographer in 2019.",2021-09-16T02:45:16Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
Marilyn Manson's Sexual Assault Lawsuit Dismissed: Report,"He still has a long way to go in battling the cases set against him, but Marilyn Manson managed to secure a legal victory. The shock-rocker has long faced accusations of sexual assault and impropriety, but only in recent years have several alleged victims come forward with their stories. We have previously reported on Manson being tacked with multiple lawsuits as women have alleged he raped and abused them.
The singer has denied the accusations and although he has maintained a low profile, Manson did make an appearance alongside Kanye West at the rapper's Donda listening event in Chicago.

On Wednesday (September 15), TMZ reported that one of the sexual assault lawsuits against Manson had been dismissed by a judge. According to the outlet, it was determined that the statute of limitations was the reason why the lawsuit was dismissed as too much time had passed. The accuser, only known as ""Jane Doe"" in documents, alleged that she began dating Manson in 2011, and during their relationship, he allegedly raped her.
Three other women, including a former assistant and a Game of Thrones actress, have filed lawsuits and those cases are ongoing. As far as the dismissed lawsuit is concerned, a judge has reportedly allowed Jane Doe to refile within 20 days, but she first has to answer to the statute of limitations and she must explain her assertion that she has repressed memories of certain events with Manson.

Rechter verwerpt aanklacht vermeend slachtoffer Marilyn Manson,"Een van de vrouwen die Marilyn Manson ervan beschuldigde haar te hebben verkracht is door de rechter terecht gewezen. Haar aanklacht tegen de zanger werd verworpen omdat ze niet specifiek kon aanduiden hoe haar geheugen al die tijd was onderdrukt en waarom ze daar niet eerder achter was gekomen. Dit meldt TMZ.
De vrouw, die anoniem wenste te blijven, beweerde dat de twee in 2011 met elkaar begonnen te daten, waarna zaken al snel bergafwaarts gingen. Manson zou haar toen verkracht hebben, zegt ze. Maar omdat het vermeende slachtoffer te vaag bleef over wat er zich had afgespeeld, verwierp de rechter haar aanklacht. Ze krijgt 20 dagen de tijd om opnieuw een aanklacht in te dienen en in te gaan op de bezwaren die zijn aangetekend.
Overigens is Manson ondanks deze verwerping nog niet uit de problemen: er lopen nog 3 aanklachten tegen hem wegens seksueel misbruik, waaronder een van actrice Esme Bianco.",2021-09-16T00:43:19Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen

Marilyn Manson Lawyer Claims Videographer Consented to Bodily Fluid Exposure,"A videographer who accuses Marilyn Manson of spitting and blowing his nose on her during a concert in New Hampshire consented to being exposed to bodily fluids, according to an attorney for the musical artist. Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, is charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from the encounter at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford on Aug. 19, 2019.
According to police, Manson approached videographer Susan Fountain in the venue’s stage pit area, put his face close to her camera and spit at her. He also is accused of blowing his nose on her arm and hands. In court documents made public Tuesday (Sept. 14), Manson’s attorney Kent Barker argues that type of filming Fountain was doing commonly exposes videographers to “incidental contact” with bodily fluids.",2021-09-15T04:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Marilyn Manson Accuser's Lawsuit Dismissed,"“Here, the Complaint alleges only that Plaintiff repressed unspecified memories at some point before reading an article in February 2021,” Keosian’s ruling reads. “The complaint alleges neither when the repression began — such as immediately after the events took place, or outside the limitations period — nor its nature or extent, such as what memories were repressed or the extent to which Plaintiff was prevented from recalling them.”
But Keosian found that the woman’s claim of repressed memories around the alleged rape -- which the ruling allows “is common for sexual-assault victims” -- was “not sufficient” to invoke California’s so-called “delayed-discovery” rule, which effectively postpones the start date of the statute of limitations if the plaintiff can prove that they first became aware of the injury within two years of filing their complaint, regardless of when the incident itself took place.
“Marilyn Manson wants to silence our client about her rape,” said Doe’s attorneys, Adam Wolf and Tracey Cowan of Peiffer Wolf, in a statement sent to Billboard. “He tried to use technical legal arguments to get her case thrown out altogether. The judge thoughtfully analyzed the case law, and rightfully held that her case can go forward, so long as she amends her Complaint to add some additional details. We intend to amend with those additional details very shortly, and look forward to the opportunity to make Manson answer for his actions.”
An attorney for Manson declined to comment.
In her original complaint, which was filed May 28, Doe claimed that over the course of their relationship, the musician subjected her to ""degrading acts of sexual exploitation, manipulation, and psychological abuse."" She alleged that when she went to return the keys to Manson’s apartment following their breakup, Manson pushed her to the floor, and ""with her face down on the carpet, and his hands on top of her,” raped her. Doe further claimed that after the alleged assault, Manson threatened to kill her and “bragged that he would get away with it” if he followed through.
Manson is currently being sued for sexual assault by three other women, including Game of Thrones actress and former girlfriend Esme Bianco, his former personal assistant Ashley Walters and another ex-girlfriend, Ashley Morgan Smithline. The lawsuits all arrived after Manson’s ex-girlfriend, actress Evan Rachel Wood, publicly named him as her abuser in February.",2021-09-15T04:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

Marilyn Manson Pleads Not Guilty to Misdemeanor Assault,"Marilyn Manson has pleaded not guilty to two charges of misdemeanor assault, Billboard reports. The arrest warrant was originally issued by New Hampshire’s Gilford Police Department in October 2019, but wasn’t announced to the public until May of this year. The charges are tied to an alleged incident at Manson’s August 18, 2019 concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion. After Manson surrendered himself to police in July and was subsequently released, the musician’s attorney filed the plea and a waiver of arraignment in Laconia District Court.
The incident involved Manson allegedly spitting at a videographer during a concert. Manson is facing potential jail sentence (maximum one year) and a maximum fine of $2000. After the arrest warrant was made public in May, an attorney for Manson called the charges “ludicrous” in an email to The New York Times.
Manson, who recently appeared at Kanye West’s third Donda event at Soldier Field in Chicago, is also facing four lawsuits from different women alleging sexual assault.

Marylin Manson: Δηλώνει αθώος στις κατηγορίες για επίθεση,"Αθώος δήλωσε μέσω του δικηγόρου του ο Marilyn Manson, ο οποίος κατηγορείται ότι πλησίασε υπάλληλο που βιντεοσκοπούσε τη συναυλία του το 2019 στο Νιου Χάμσαϊρ και την έφτυσε.
Ο Manson, του οποίου το πραγματικό όνομα είναι Brian Hugh Warner, παραδόθηκε τον Ιούλιο στην αστυνομία του Λος Άντζελες, καθώς εκκρεμούσε ένταλμα σύλληψης εναντίον του.
Ο μουσικός κατηγορήθηκε για δύο πλημμελήματα για απλή επίθεση που φέρεται να έκανε στις 19 Αυγούστου 2019, αε μια συναυλία στο Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion στο Gilford. Οι ποινές για τα πλημμελήματα αυτά είναι φυλάκιση λιγότερη του ενός έτους και πρόστιμο 2.000 δολάρια.
Η ακροαματική διαδικασία ήταν προγραμματισμένη για σήμερα, αλλά ο πληρεξούσιος δικηγόρος του Μάνσον κατέθεσε την δήλωση αθωότητάς του και έκανε προσφυγή στο Επαρχιακό Δικαστήριο της Laconia. Η υπόθεση έχει μετατεθεί για τις 27 Δεκεμβρίου.
Η Susan Fountain, κινηματογραφίστρια η ίδια, βρισκόταν στη σκηνή κατά τη διάρκεια της φερόμενης επίθεσης. Η εταιρεία της, Metronome Media, είχε υπογράψει με την Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion για τη σεζόν των συναυλιών.
Σύμφωνα με την καταγγελία, ο Manson την πλησίασε την πρώτη φορά, έβαλε το πρόσωπό του κοντά στην κάμερα και την έφτυσε. Τα χέρια της κόλλησαν με το σάλιο του, όπως αναφέρεται.
Ο Manson φέρεται να επέστρεψε για δεύτερη φορά, καλύπτοντας τη μία πλευρά του ρουθουνιού του και φυσώντας πάνω της. Εκείνη άφησε την κάμερα της και πήγε στην τουαλέτα για να πλύνει τα χέρια της, που είχαν πάνω τους τα σωματικά υγρά του.
Ο τραγουδιστής είναι ωστόσο αντιμέτωπος και με άλλες κατηγορίες, που δεν σχετίζονται με την παραπάνω, τις οποίες ο ίδιος αρνείται.
Τον Φεβρουάριο, η ηθοποιός Evan Rachel Wood κατήγγειλε τον πρώην αρραβωνιαστικό της, για σεξουαλική και σωματική κακοποίηση, ισχυριζόμενη ότι «χειραγωγήθηκε με σκοπό την υποταγή» κατά τη διάρκεια της σχέσης τους.
Μήνες αργότερα, η ηθοποιός του «Game of Thrones», Esmé Bianco, μήνυσε τον Manson σε ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο στο Λος Άντζελες, κατηγορώντας τον για σεξουαλική, σωματική και συναισθηματική κακοποίηση.

Westside Gunn & Marilyn Manson Connect,"Westside Gunn is not afraid of controversy, and today the Griselda visionary decided to stare it dead in the face.
Taking to Instagram, Gunn uploaded a picture of himself and Marilyn Manson, who currently stands accused of rape and sexual, physical, and emotional assault in lawsuits filed by multiple women.

Manson has denied the authenticity of the claims. ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,"" he wrote, addressing the accusations in February. ""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners.""
Though many have distanced themselves from the singer, Kanye West embraced him with an onstage invite to the latest DONDA listening event. Afterward, it would appear that Manson ended up linking with Westside Gunn backstage for a photo. Upon posting the image, many flooded Gunn's comments with disapproval, prompting Gunn to respond with his take on the matter.

""Matter of fakt y’all show me where he was convicted I’ll take it down!!!"" he writes, amidst a sea of negativity. ""Until then stfu… I been to prison before u can’t say somebody a snitch without paperwork, yall can’t convict anybody off allegations. Y’all didn’t stop watching Tyson fights and I love Tyson. Y’all didn’t say that about Kobe legacy and I love Kobe, y’all don’t say that about 2pac y’all say he the greatest so get tf outta here. Y’all was just saying don’t wear Gucci last year and now y’all lined down the block for them belts.""
Clearly, Westside Gunn is unconcerned by the association, though he may consider taking it down should Manson be found guilty. Check out the unlikely crossover below.",2021-09-02T14:46:05Z,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com,HotNewHipHop
Marilyn Manson pleads not guilty to blowing snot at videographer,"Shark Tank investors Kevin O'Leary and Kevin Harrington named in fraud suit 'Sharks' named in fraud suit Photo: All rights reserved. Kevin O'Leary Shark Tank investors Kevin O'Leary and Kevin Harrington have been accused of scamming hopeful entrepreneurs.
The businessmen have been hit by a lawsuit from 20 people across the US, which has alleged they worked together to defraud people through the alleged use of ""fictional executives, false promises of financial success, and even illusions of being on the show Shark Tank itself.""
According to legal documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight, the pair allegedly used a ""predatory fraud scheme to induce inventors and entrepreneurs to hire one of two companies, InventureX or Ideazon.""
The entrepreneurs claim they were asked to invest financial resources into them and in return were ""promised that they would receive help with crowd funding to start their businesses.""
However, after paying InventureX and Ideazon, they didn't receive any help or support.
The documents state: ""These companies turned out to be nothing less than facades designed to lure in unsuspecting victims, extract their money and then virtually disappear under the guise of delays, minimal to no performance, and no results.""
The lawsuit suggests it is possible the companies don't even really exist or could both be a front to scam potential investors.
A probe into InventureX and Ideazon revealed ""they used the same success stories, same percentage rates of success, same marketing/promotional ideas, same promises/representations, same agreements, same bank accounts and one entity pulling both their strings: Defendant Crowdfund, LLC.""
Harrington - who appeared regularly on the first two seasons of Shark Tank - is listed as a partner and primary executive of InventureX,"" while O'Leary, who has been on the panel since 2009, allegedly ""endorsed and recommended"" the same two companies.
The people who have filed the fraud case claim their losses could run to hundreds of thousands of dollars per plaintiff.
The lawsuit is asking for damages, economic loss, emotional distress and legal fees to be paid by the two reality TV stars.
According to TMZ, the 20 people attached to the suit represent a small portion of potential victims, which could ultimately run into the hundreds.

The Lockdown Sessions will feature Cold Heart (PNAU Remix), which he recorded with Dua Lipa, as well as collaborations with the late Glen Campbell, Lil Nas X, Nicki Minaj, Charlie Puth, Stevie Nicks, and Stevie Wonder.
""The last thing I expected to do during lockdown was make an album, but, as the pandemic went on, one-off projects kept cropping up,"" Elton said in a statement. ""All the tracks I worked on were really interesting and diverse, stuff that was completely different to anything I'm known for, stuff that took me out of my comfort zone into completely new territory.
""I realized there was something weirdly familiar about working like this. At the start of my career, in the late '60s, I worked as a session musician. Working with different artists during lockdown reminded me of that. I'd come full circle: I was a session musician again. And it was still a blast.""

Smith himself surprised the young star with the news on Tuesday in a video chat, which has been shared to YouTube.
""I'm so ready to bite down,"" Jabari told Will, revealing his dad alerted him to the audition for the new Fresh Prince series and two months later he got the call from his agent that he was being considered.

The new show will be Jabari's first television role.
Diane Warren: 'Cher hated If I Could Turn Back Time' Cher hated Turn Back Time Photo: All rights reserved. Cher Cher once hated the song that became one of her biggest hits - If I Could Turn Back Time, by songwriter Diane Warren.
On a Tuesday appearance on British breakfast program Lorraine, Warren revealed the I Got You Babe hitmaker initially refused to sing the track that became a chart topper in1989.
""Yes, Cher hated it,"" Diane said of the song, which she penned exclusively for the Moonstruck star. ""I basically had to hold her leg down in the studio lounge and say, 'I'm not letting go of your leg until you at least try this song.'
""The rest is history, right? It's probably her most iconic song, but she definitely didn't want to record it. She hated it.""
Warren's instincts were right: If I Could Turn Back Time became Cher's second consecutive solo number one on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Chart in the U.S.
Ofcom rejects complaints about Piers Morgan's Duchess of Sussex comments on Good Morning Britain Morgan complaints rejected Photo: All rights reserved. 2019 British Academy Britannia Awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on October 25, 2019 in Beverly Hills, CA
Photo: Nicky Nelson/WENN.com British newsman Piers Morgan is off the hook after communications regulator Ofcom rejected complaints about comments he made about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, which led to his Good Morning Britain exit.
The former tabloid editor-turned-TV host took aim at Meghan in March (21) following the airing of her explosive TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, during which she claimed her mixed-race background made members of the royal family uncomfortable.
Morgan was taken to task for his comments, walked off the set of his live U.K. breakfast show, then quit the program hours later.
Thousands of viewers complained to Ofcom about Morgan's comments about Meghan, but the body has found, following an investigation, that Good Morning Britain was not in breach of the broadcasting code with the remarks.
After the decision was made, Piers tweeted his joy, writing: ""BREAKING: ? @Ofcom rejects all complaints against me over Meghan Markle furor that led to my exit from @GMB ?. Verdict says I was entitled to disbelieve her & Prince Harry & to restrict my right to do so would be a ""chilling restriction on freedom of expression.""
He then questioned whether or not he would be offered his position back at Good Morning Britain, adding: ""I'm delighted OFCOM has endorsed my right to disbelieve the Duke & Duchess of Sussex's incendiary claims to Oprah Winfrey, many of which have proven to be untrue. This is a resounding victory for free speech and a resounding defeat for Princess Pinocchios. Do I get my job back?""

The Godfather director is willing to spend more than $100 million making the movie that has been in the pipeline for decades and is hoping that stars such as Oscar Isaac and Cate Blanchett come on board.
Francis also wants Forest Whitaker, Jon Voight, Zendaya, Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange for the proposed film and is also set to be reunited with James Caan, who played Sonny Corleone in The Godfather.
""I'm committed to making this movie, I'd like to make it in the fall of 2022,"" he told Deadline. ""I don't have all my cast approved, but I have enough of them to have confidence that it is going to be a very exciting cast. The picture's going to cost $100 million to $120 million . Needless to say, I hope it's closer to $100 million.
""I'm prepared to match some outside financing, almost dollar for dollar. In other words, I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is.""
The movie takes place in a modern city but the origins of the story are in Ancient Rome and Francis is confident that the flick will be different from everything else that is on offer in cinemas.
The 82-year-old filmmaker said: ""This film I want to make, I believe is an exciting change from the kinds of movies being offered to the public.
""Mainly because it puts forward a fundamental message that it's time for us to consider the society we live in isn't the only alternative available to us. And that a utopia isn't so much a little experiment place in the country; a utopia is a discussion of people asking the right questions on just that subject, and if the society we're living in is the only alternative or, if for the sake of young people, there are better choices that should be discussed.
""Hopefully that is the influence I dream of this movie having. And for that reason I am willing and capable of investing at a high number, to make it come true. I'm putting together the means of doing that.""

Not Guilty Plea Entered for Marilyn Manson on Misdemeanors,"This article is republished here with permission from The Associated Press . This content is shared here because the topic may interest Snopes readers; it does not, however, represent the work of Snopes fact-checkers or editors.
LACONIA, N.H. (AP) — An attorney has entered a not guilty plea on behalf of musical artist Marilyn Manson, who is accused of approaching a videographer at his 2019 concert in New Hampshire and allegedly spitting and blowing his nose on her.
Manson, whose legal name is Brian Hugh Warner, surrendered in July to police in Los Angeles in connection with a 2019 arrest warrant in the case. The allegations were detailed in a police affidavit that was released along with a criminal complaint.
Manson was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from the alleged altercation on Aug. 19, 2019, at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford. The misdemeanor charges can each result in a jail sentence of less than a year and a $2,000 fine if convicted.
An arraignment hearing on the charges was scheduled for Thursday, but an attorney for Manson filed the not guilty plea and a wavier of arraignment in Laconia District Court. A case status hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 27.
Susan Fountain, a videographer, was in the venue’s stage pit area at the time of the alleged assault. Her company, Metronome Media, was contracted by the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion for the concert season.
According to the affidavit, Manson approached Fountain the first time, put his face close to the camera and spit a “big lougee” at her. She was struck on both hands with saliva.
Manson allegedly returned a second time, covering one side of his nostril and blowing in Fountain’s direction. Fountain put down her camera and went to the restroom to wash her hands and arms that had Manson’s bodily fluids on them.
Manson also has faced abuse accusations — unrelated to the New Hampshire allegation — in recent years. He has denied wrongdoing.
In February, actor Evan Rachel Wood publicly accused Manson, her ex-fiance, of sexual and other physical abuse, alleging she was “manipulated into submission” during their relationship. Months later, “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco sued Manson in federal court in Los Angeles, alleging sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Bianco and Wood have spoken publicly.
In 2018, Los Angeles County prosecutors declined to file charges against Manson over allegations of assault, battery and sexual assault dating to 2011, saying they were limited by statutes of limitations and a lack of corroboration. The accuser in that case was identified only as a social acquaintance of Manson.",2021-09-02T04:00:00Z,https://www.snopes.com,Snopes.com

An arraignment hearing on the charges was scheduled for Thursday, but an attorney for Manson filed the not guilty plea and a wavier of arraignment in Laconia District Court. A case status hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 27.
Susan Fountain, a videographer, was in the venue’s stage pit area at the time of the alleged assault. Her company, Metronome Media, was contracted by the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion for the concert season.
According to the affidavit, Manson approached Fountain the first time, put his face close to the camera and spit a “big lougee” at her. She was struck on both hands with saliva.
Manson allegedly returned a second time, covering one side of his nostril and blowing in Fountain’s direction. Fountain put down her camera and went to the restroom to wash her hands and arms that had Manson’s bodily fluids on them.
Manson also has faced abuse accusations — unrelated to the New Hampshire allegation — in recent years. He has denied wrongdoing.
In February, actor Evan Rachel Wood publicly accused Manson, her ex-fiance, of sexual and other physical abuse, alleging she was “manipulated into submission” during their relationship. Months later, “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco sued Manson in federal court in Los Angeles, alleging sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Bianco and Wood have spoken publicly.
In 2018, Los Angeles County prosecutors declined to file charges against Manson over allegations of assault, battery and sexual assault dating to 2011, saying they were limited by statutes of limitations and a lack of corroboration. The accuser in that case was identified only as a social acquaintance of Manson.",2021-09-02T02:14:00Z,https://abcnews.go.com,ABC News

Advocaat Marilyn Manson: mijn cliënt is onschuldig,"Een van de advocaten van Marilyn Manson heeft namens de zanger laten weten dat hij pleit onschuldig te zijn in de tegen hem aangespannen zaak uit 2019. Manson zou destijds tijdens een concert in New Hampshire een cameravrouw hebben aangevallen en bespuugd. Dit meldt AP.
Manson, wiens echte naam Brian Hugh Warner is, meldde zichzelf in juli bij de politie in Los Angeles nadat er een arrestatiebevel uitstond. Ook toen al meldde hij onschuldig te zijn en wilde dat kracht bij zetten door zelf naar het politiebureau te komen. ""Ik heb niks te verbergen,"" aldus Manson.
Mocht de excentrieke zanger, die eveneens flink onder vuur ligt vanwege meerdere aanklachten tegen hem over seksueel misbruik, door de rechter wèl schuldig bevonden worden, dan kan hij daar maximaal een jaar celstraf of een boete van 1700 euro voor krijgen. De zaak stond gepland voor donderdag, maar omdat Mansons advocaat een document heeft ingediend met een 'niet schuldig' verklaring gaat deze niet door.
Op 27 december staat er een zitting gepland om de zaak door te nemen. Tot die tijd is de zanger op vrije voeten.
Manson kwam afgelopen week in het nieuws toen hij bij de albumrelease van Kanye West verscheen, samen met rapper DaBaby die onder vuur ligt vanwege homofobe uitspraken.",2021-09-01T23:58:10Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen

"""Donda"", le dixième album aussi réussi que controversé de Kanye West","""Donda"", du nom de sa mère, le dixième album du rappeur américain Kanye West publié dimanche, suscite à la fois l'enthousiasme et la controverse, en accueillant parmi ses invités notamment Marilyn Manson, accusé de viol, et DaBaby, rappeur aux récents propos homophobes.
""Donda"" martelé une bonne centaine de fois en guise de beat d'ouverture par Syleena Johnson. Kanye West est bien de retour et craint d'emblée qu'on oublie le nom de son dixième album studio, qui est celui de sa mère décédée en 2007... Peu de risques toutefois au vu des 27 nouveaux titres aussi réussis que mégalomaniaques et controversés publiés officiellement dimanche, après des semaines de retard et plusieurs séances d'écoute dans des stades bondés aux Etats-Unis qui auraient permis de faire évoluer les morceaux.
Après ""Ye"" et ""Jesus is King"", le rappeur américain marque à nouveau les esprits, en s'entourant cette fois deux heures durant d'une pléiade d'invités renommés. De Jay-Z à The Weeknd via Travis Scott, Ariana Grande ou Lil Baby et des personnalités plus polémiques, à l'image du chanteur américain Marylin Manson, accusé de viol, du rappeur DaBaby, qui avait provoqué cet été une controverse avec des propos homophobes et sexistes, et de Chris Brown, condamné en 2009 pour coups et blessures sur la chanteuse Rihanna qui signe les paroles et la musique de ""New Again"". Dans sa grande bonté, Kanye West offre aussi à quelques nouveaux talents un enviable strapontin, du défunt rappeur américain Pop Smoke à la Jamaïcaine Shenseea.
>> A écouter à défaut encore de clip vidéo, l'album ""Donda"":
Thèmes religieux et séparation d'avec Kim Kardashian
Le nouveau répertoire musicalement flamboyant et égomaniaque de Kanye West aborde encore des thèmes religieux (""God Braithed"", ""Praise God"" ou ""Jesus Lord""), évoquant la sainte conversion du rappeur à Dieu, et fait aussi de nombreuses fois référence à sa généalogie familiale ainsi qu'à sa séparation ultra médiatisée avec Kim Kardashian avec laquelle il est en instance de divorce.
Au coeur de ces morceaux denses et très variés dopés par une armada de producteurs, Kanye West interroge par ailleurs souvent ses propres contradictions existentielles et spirituelles, tiraillé entre génie absolu et idiot du village, pêcheur et messie. Autant de zones d'ombres parfaitement scandées, mêmes quand elles sont vocodées à l'excès, qui réhaussent les rythmiques au contraire parfois trop tapageuses pour pleinement séduire.
""Je vais être honnête, nous sommes tous des menteurs"".
Si la chanson-titre s'avère des plus démagogiques, avec ses remerciements aux fans pour leur soutien à son exceptionnelle personnalité depuis de nombreuses années, Kanye West s'avère lexicalement bien plus inspiré ailleurs. Comme entre autres dans l'impressionnant ""Jail"" où, au côté de Jay-Z, il joue sur un fil équilibriste au repentant échappé de prison et sauvé par Jésus et Moïse, mais confessant au passage ""je vais être honnête, nous sommes tous des menteurs"".
L'artiste de 44 ans, qui a aussi entamé une procédure pour changer officiellement son nom en ""Ye"" - son surnom- et envisage de se représenter à la prochaine élection présidentielle américaine de 2024, montre ici de belles dispositions inventives au-delà de ses bondieuseries obsessives.

Evan Rachel Wood zeigt ihrem Ex-Verlobten Marilyn Manson den Mittelfinger,"Die Schauspielerin hat gegen ihren Ex-Verlobten Vorwürfe des Missbrauchs erhoben. Nach seinem Auftritt in Kanye Wests «Donda»-Show hat sie ihm nun ein klares Zeichen gesendet.
Auf der Bühne : Evan Rachel Wood zeigt Marilyn Manson den Mittelfinger
1 / 8 Dieses Bild dürfte wohl viele Leute verärgert haben: Kanye West (44) performt mit Rapper DaBaby (29) und Schockrocker Marilyn Manson (52) auf seiner «Donda»-Release-Party. Apple Music Seit Beginn des Jahres wird dem Sänger von mehreren Frauen sexuelle oder physische Gewalt und Missbrauch vorgeworfen. Er weist bislang alle Anschuldigungen von sich. Getty Images via AFP/Frazer Harrison Besonders verärgert über Mansons jüngste Performance mit Kanye West ist wohl Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (33). Anfang Februar sprach seine Ex-Verlobte das erste Mal über den schrecklichen Missbrauch, den sie durch Manson erfahren haben soll. Instagram/evanrachelwood
Darum gehts Anfang des Jahres warfen mehrere Frauen dem Schockrocker Marilyn Manson (52) vor, ihnen sexuelle und psychische Gewalt angetan zu haben.
Darunter: seine Ex-Verlobte Evan Rachel Wood (33).
Nach Mansons kontroversem Auftritt an Kanye Wests «Donda»-Event ergreift der «Westworld»-Star nun erneut das Wort.
Auf der Bühne des Bourbon Rooms Hollywood performt die Schauspielerin den Song «You Get What You Give» von den New Radicals – und zeigt ihrem Ex dabei den Mittelfinger.
Bei seinem dritten «Donda»-Release-Event im Football-Stadion Soldier Field in Chicago vergangenen Donnerstag holte Rapper Kanye West zwei umstrittene Figuren aus dem Musikbiz auf die Bühne: Rapper DaBaby (29), der wegen homophober Äusserungen von mehreren Festivals gestrichen wurde, und Musiker Marilyn Manson (52), gegen den wegen sexueller Misshandlung ermittelt wird. Eine, die sich über den Auftritt des Schockrockers wohl besonders aufregte, war seine Ex-Verlobte Evan Rachel Wood (33).
Am Samstag zeigte sich die Schauspielerin auf der Bühne des Bourbon Rooms in Hollywood. Begleitet von nur einer Gitarre und ihrem Handy in der Hand, performte der «Westworld»-Star den Song «You Get What You Give» von der Band New Radicals. Während des Auftritts hob Wood schliesslich ihren Mittelfinger – in dem Moment, in dem sie Mansons Namen sang, der im vorgetragenen Song an einer Stelle vorkommt.
«Gebt nicht auf»
Ein Video von ihrem Auftritt postete die 33-Jährige dann auf Instagram – und kommentiert dazu: «Das ist für die anderen Überlebenden, die diese Woche eine Ohrfeige bekommen haben. Ich liebe euch. Gebt nicht auf.» Anfang Februar hatten die US-Schauspielerin sowie weitere Frauen schwere Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen Manson erhoben.
Damals veröffentlichte Evan Rachel Wood ein Statement auf Instagram, in dem sie vor der Gefahr, die von ihrem Ex ausgehe, warnte: «Der Name des Täters ist Brian Warner, der Welt auch als Marilyn Manson bekannt. Er hat mich jahrelang auf schreckliche Weise misshandelt. Ich wurde einer Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und zur Unterwerfung manipuliert. Ich habe es satt, in Angst vor Vergeltung, Verleumdung oder Erpressung zu leben.»
Marilyn Manson hat die Missbrauchsvorwürfe bislang immer zurückgewiesen. Seine Kunst und sein Leben seien schon lange «Magnete für Kontroversen», aber die jüngsten Behauptungen über ihn seien «schreckliche Verfälschungen der Realität», schrieb der Musiker damals auf Instagram. Seine intimen Beziehungen mit gleichgesinnten Partnerinnen seien immer einvernehmlich gewesen. Dies sei die Wahrheit, egal wie andere nun die Vergangenheit verzerren würden, führte Manson aus.",2021-08-31T17:18:03Z,https://www.20min.ch,20 Minuten

Evan Rachel Wood accused Marilyn Manson of sexual abuse
In February 2021, actor and singer Evan Rachel Wood accused her former partner Marilyn Manson of sexual abuse. Wood wrote an Instagram post naming Brian Warner, Manson’s real name, as her abuser. She accused him of “grooming [her] when [she] was a teenager” and said he “horrifically abused [her] for years.” She also wrote that she was “brainwashed and manipulated into submission.”
According to Vanity Fair, at least four other women have come forward with similar allegations against Manson. They each detailed their experiences of “sexual assault, psychological abuse, and/or various forms of coercion, violence, and intimidation” at the hands of Manson.
Manson categorically denied all the allegations by posting a blanket rebuttal on Instagram. “Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”

Kanye West brought Marilyn Manson on stage at his Chicago ‘Donda’ listening party
West has held listening events for his new album in Atlanta, Georgia and Chicago, Illinois. At one of his Chicago listening parties, West had a replica of his childhood home on stage. He invited DaBaby and Marilyn Manson, two musicians who are currently embroiled in controversy, onto the porch of his replica home during the event.
Both DaBaby and Manson appear on Donda on a track called “Jail, Pt. 2.” which seems to address the controversies both disgraced artists are facing. “Jail, Pt. 2” has Manson singing lyrics like, “I’ll be honest, we all liars; I’m pulled over and I got priors; Guess we goin’ down, guess who’s goin’ to jail? Guess who’s goin’ to jail tonight?”
In light of Wood’s and the other women’s accusations, the lyrics are highly suggestive.

Evan Rachel Wood responded to Kanye West’s hosting Marilyn Manson
Actor and singer Wood, who has won three Golden Globes, didn’t hold back from calling out her alleged abuser on Instagram. She also seemed to call out West for hosting her ex at his listening party.
According to People, Wood performed a cover of the New Radicals’ 1998 single “You Get What You Give” with her musical partner Zane Carney (of Evan + Zane) on Saturday at the Bourbon Room in Los Angeles.
“I’ve been saving this, but it seems like the appropriate time,” Wood told the audience before starting to sing the popular song, which contains a reference to Manson in the lyrics. Wood put up her middle finger as she sang his name, making the audience erupt in cheers and applause.
Wood posted a video of the performance to her Instagram account. She captioned the post, “For my fellow survivors who got slapped in the face this week. I love you. Don’t give up.”
The actor and singer also uploaded a screenshot of a Loudwire headline that says, “Marilyn Manon’s Voice Is Featured on Kanye West’s ‘Donda’ Album” to her Instagram Stories. Wood tagged Loudwire in the story and underneath the headline wrote, “Triggered, re-traumatized, and unsafe.”

Evan Rachel Wood Tells Survivors 'Don't Give Up' After Marilyn Manson's 'Donda' Collab,"Evan Rachel Wood has seemingly condemned Marilyn Manson's inclusion on Kanye West's new album Donda.
The Westworld actress spoke out and addressed ""survivors"" while on stage this weekend, shortly after it was reported that Manson was confirmed to be featured on the album and after his appearance on stage with West in Chicago last Thursday.

Wood is one of a number of women who has accused her ex-boyfriend Manson (real name Brian Warner) of ""horrific abuse""—claims the rockstar denies.
Following the album's release over the weekend, Wood shared a clip of herself on Instagram performing ""You Get What You Give"" by the New Radicals to a crowd at Hollywood's Bourbon Room on Saturday.
She captioned the video: ""'You get what you give.' For my fellow survivors who got slapped in the face this week. I love you. Don't give up.""
""I've been saving this but it seems like the appropriate time,"" Evan said in a video before raising her middle finger as she sang Manson's name.
While Wood did not reference West or Manson directly, it is highly likely she is referencing Manson's inclusion on Donda and appearance at the listening event, which was attended by almost 40,000 people.
The 33-year-old detailed her experience with Manson in February when she posted a harrowing statement on Instagram.
""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,"" Wood wrote at the time.
""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.
""I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""
The former couple started dating in 2007. She was 18 at the time while he was 36. They got engaged in 2010 but split seven months later.
In 2009, Manson spoke about Wood in a Spin interview, saying: ""I have fantasies every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer.""
Following West's claims, other women came forward with similar accusations against Manson, including actress Esmé Bianco, of Game of Thrones fame.
As of June this year, Manson is facing four sexual assault lawsuits—he denies all allegations against him.
Addressing the situation on Instagram earlier this year, Manson wrote: ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how—and why—others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""",2021-08-31T12:31:57Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
Evan Rachel Wood gives Marilyn Manson the finger on stage,"After controversially appearing onstage at Kanye West’s ‘Donda’ event last week, Evan Rachel Wood has furiously hit out.
Evan Rachel Wood blasted her allegedly abusive ex Marilyn Manson after he appeared onstage at Kanye West’s ‘Donda’ event last week.
The Westworld star, 33, subtly called out Manson, 52, while performing a cover of New Radicals’ 1998 single You Get What You Give with her musical partner Zane Carney on Saturday at the Bourbon Room in Hollywood.
“I’ve been saving this, but it seems like the appropriate time,” she prefaced the song, which includes a reference to the embattled performer.
When Wood reached the part of the track that mentioned Manson’s name, she put up her middle finger as the crowd erupted in cheers.
She shared a clip of her performance on Instagram and addressed the shock rocker’s other alleged victims.
“You get what you give,” she wrote. “For my fellow survivors who got slapped in the face this week. I love you. Don’t give up.”
The Thirteen star named Manson as her alleged abuser in February after claiming for years that she had been abused by an unnamed ex.
“He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” she claimed to Vanity Fair. “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.”

Wood is one of 15 women who have come forward to accuse the Killing Strangers singer of sexual assault or abuse. Manson has vehemently denied all the allegations, calling them “horrible distortions of reality”.
“My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth,” he wrote on Instagram in February.
West, 44, recently came under fire for inviting Manson and rapper DaBaby – who made homophobic remarks during a festival performance in July – to appear alongside him at the final listening party for his new album, Donda.
The Gold Digger singer caused even more of an uproar Sunday when Donda finally hit streaming services and included a collaboration with both Manson and DaBaby, 29, titled Jail Pt. 2.

Kanye West Hosted Marilyn Manson and DaBaby at 'Donda' Event Despite Controversies,"Kanye West has been making headlines lately for his 10th studio album Donda. The rapper’s listening parties have generated a lot of buzz in the entertainment industry. Whether West is weeping onstage about losing his family or bringing out Kim Kardashian West in a bridal gown amidst the couple’s divorce, the musician certainly knows how to bring attention to the Donda events.
At a listening party in Chicago, West brought Marilyn Manson and DaBaby on stage, despite the controversies surrounding both musicians. Here is everything you need to know about the two polarizing artists and why West hosted them.
Marilyn Mason is accused of sexual abuse by multiple women
In February 2021, actress Evan Rachel Wood accused former partner Marilyn Manson of abuse. Wood wrote an Instagram post naming Brian Warner, Manson’s real name, as her abuser. She accused him of “grooming [her] when [she] was a teenager” and “horrifically abused [her] for years.” She also wrote that she was “brainwashed and manipulated into submission.”
Wood is not alone in her claims. According to Vanity Fair, at least four other women have come forward with allegations against Manson. They gave details of their experiences of “sexual assault, psychological abuse, and/or various forms of coercion, violence, and intimidation.”
Manson was quickly dropped from his record label and cut from a television series. He then posted his rebuttal on Instagram. “Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”
In July 2021, DaBaby performed at Rolling Loud Miami music festival. The rapper’s performance sparked controversy when he made some homophobic and misogynistic comments on stage.
“If you didn’t show up today with HIV, AIDS, or any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases that’ll make you die in two to three weeks, then put your cell phone lighter up,” DaBaby told attendees (per Billboard). “Ladies, if your p— smell like water, put your cell phone lighter up. Fellas, if you ain’t sucking d— in the parking lot, put your cell phone lighter up.”
DaBaby later doubled down on his comments on a video he posted to Instagram. “My gay fans, they take care of themselves. They ain’t no nasty gay n—as. See what I’m saying? They ain’t no junkies in the street. The hell you talking about, n—as? Then I said if you ain’t sucking d— in the parking lot, put your cell phone lighter up. You know what my gay fans did? Put that motherf—ing light up, n—a, ’cause my gay fans ain’t going for that. They got class. They ain’t sucking no d— in no parking lot.”
DaBaby has been dropped from multiple festival lineups following his controversial remarks.

Both Marilyn Manson and DaBaby are featured on Kanye West’s ‘Donda’ album
At Chicago’s Soldier Field, West brought both Manson and DaBaby on stage with him during his Donda listening event. The trio posed on a set replicating West’s childhood home.
The track “Jail, Pt. 2” from West’s new Donda album features vocals by Manson and DaBaby. Their contributions to the album are likely why West involved them in the listening party.
The song seems to address the controversies both disgraced artists are facing. “Jail, Pt. 2” has Manson singing lyrics like, “I’ll be honest, we all liars; I’m pulled over and I got priors; Guess we goin’ down, guess who’s goin’ to jail? Guess who’s goin’ to jail tonight?”
In DaBaby’s part, he raps, “I know these people gon’ try to tell me how to talk; don’t know what I seen or what I was taught; my mama worked two or three jobs to take care of three of her kids, my uncles watched; yeah, we was raised by the crack addicts.”
Later in his verse, he raps, “Only thing I did to you; was always keep it real and true; guilty, guess they gon’ have to take me.”

Evan Rachel Woods : le coup d'éclat de l'ex de Marilyn Manson en plein concert,"1/12 - Evan Rachel Woods : le coup d'éclat de l'ex de Marilyn Manson en plein concert Ce dimanche 29 août, Kanye West sortait l'album ""Donda"". Véritable surprise pour ses fans, la sortie de ce dixième album a suscité l'étonnement, mais aussi la colère de certaines personnalités, en raison des artistes présents sur la tracklist.
Lors d'un concert à Hollywood, Evan Rachel Woods n'a pas hésité à transmettre un message radical à Marilyn Manson, son ex qu'elle accuse de viol et de sévices psychologiques.
Ce dimanche 29 août, Kanye West sortait l'album Donda. Véritable surprise pour ses fans, la sortie de ce dixième album suscite l'étonnement, mais crée également la polémique et suscite la colère de certaines personnalités, en raison des artistes présents sur la tracklist.
A l'occasion de la troisième écoute publique de l'album, qui s'est tenue à Chicago, Kanye West a invité Marilyn Manson sur scène pour interpréter le morceau Jail 2 sur lequel il figure en featuring dans la version studio. Pour rappel, Evan Rachel Woods a partagé la vie de Marilyn Manson de 2007 à 2010, et accuse le chanteur de viols à répétition et de harcèlement. Plusieurs anciennes compagnes de Marilyn Manson assurent avoir vécu le même calvaire que la jeune femme.
Hors de question pour l'actrice de Westworld de rester indifférente à ce qu'elle considère comme une humiliation. Lors d'un concert qu'elle donne à Hollywood le week-end du 29 août, elle interprète le titre You Get What You Give des New Radicals : ""J'ai attendu, mais cette occasion me semble appropriée""
L'album de Kanye West : une ""gifle en plein visage"" pour plusieurs victimes ?
Dans ce tube des années 1990, le nom de Marilyn Manson est mentionné (""Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson / Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson""), et Evan Rachel Woods n'hésite pas à lever son majeur au moment du fameux passage, sous les applaudissements du public.
La scène ayant été filmée, l'actrice n'a pas hésité à poster l'extrait de la vidéo sur Instagram, avec une légende à l'attention des autres victimes : ""Pour les autres survivantes qui se sont pris une gifle en plein visage cette semaine. Je vous aime. N'abandonnez pas.""
Parmi les artistes présents dans l'album Donda, Marilyn Manson n'est pas le seul à ne pas faire l'unanimité : Le rappeur DaBaby, présent sur le même morceau, était également sur la scène de Chicago. Sa présence a suscité la colère de plusieurs personnes et pour cause : le rappeur avait été épinglé il y a quelques semaines pour des propos homophobes, ainsi que des paroles stigmatisant les personnes séropositives.
Ce scandale homophobe lui avait valu le boycott de plusieurs artistes comme Dua Lipa, ou encore des déprogrammations dans plusieurs festivals comme Lollapalooza.

Evan Rachel Wood Flips Off Marilyn Manson After Kanye West 'Re-traumatized' Survivors,"You get what you give ... or at least that’s what Evan Rachel Wood is hoping for when it comes to her ex Marilyn Manson, whom she accused of sexual assault along with at least a dozen other women.
Days after Kanye West brought out the shock rocker at his final listening event ahead of the release of his new album, “Donda,” the “Westworld” star had a song of her own to sing.
Taking the stage at Los Angeles’ Bourbon Room on Saturday night, Wood performed a cover of the signature New Radicals track “You Get What You Give,” which famously name-checks Manson as someone in need of a good ass-kicking.
“I’ve been saving this but it seems like the appropriate time,” Wood prefaced her performance with collaborator Zane Carney, whom she tours with as a band under the name Evan + Zane.
When it came time to sing Manson’s name, Wood put a middle finger up in defiance, with the crowd erupting in cheers before she closed out the number. (See the moment below at 4:45.)
Sharing a video from the show on Instagram Sunday, Wood said the performance was was dedicated to “my fellow survivors who got slapped in the face this week,” presumably referencing West’s recent, and very public, support of Manson.
“I love you. Don’t give up,” she wrote in the caption.
After years of speaking out about being a victim of sexual assault and advocating for the rights of other survivors, Wood publicly named Manson as her abuser in February along with four other women.
Wood alleged that Manson began “grooming” her when she was a teenager and “horrifically abused” her for several years during their relationship in the mid-to-late 2000s.
“I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission,” Wood wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.”
Since then, many more women, including “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco and comedian Charlyne Yi, have come forward with their own allegations against Manson, ranging from sexual assault and harassment to psychological abuse and verbal threats.
Manson, who was recently charged with assaulting a photographer in 2019, has denied the allegations, calling them “horrible distortions of reality.”
Despite the many accusations against him and an open investigation into various alleged incidents of domestic violence by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, Manson has seemingly found a friend in West as of late.
Evan Rachel Wood/Instagram An Instagram Story shared by Evan Rachel Wood.
After West brought Manson out onstage alongside rapper DaBaby — who’s embroiled in his own controversy over recent homophobic comments — it was revealed that Manson is also featured as a co-writer on West’s new album.
Later in the weekend, Wood took a direct shot at West for working with her alleged abuser, writing in an Instagram Story, “Triggered, re-traumatized, and unsafe,” across a news article about their collaboration, according to People. Wood received plenty of support on her Instagram post, with friends and collaborators praising her strength in the comments. “You are a powerhouse warrior woman my sweet friend,” Rumer Willis wrote. In a separate comment, Carney added, “I love you and love that we learned this backstage 3 min before we played it.”",2021-08-30T18:30:38Z,https://www.huffpost.com,The Huffington Post
"Kanye West, en el centro de la polémica por invitar a su disco 'Donda' al presunto violador Marilyn Manson","Kanye West, en el centro de la polémica por invitar a su disco 'Donda' al presunto violador Marilyn Manson El rapero, que llevaba años haciendo esperar a sus fans, ha llenado el álbum de colaboraciones de lo más variopintas
Nacho Serrano Actualizado: 30/08/2021 19:16h Guardar Enviar noticia por correo electrónico Tu nombre * Tu correo electrónico * Su correo electrónico *
Los seguidores de Kanye West han tenido una paciencia infinita con el rapero, que lleva más de un año haciéndoles esperar a su nuevo disco entre retrasos, amagos de retiro y otras noticias de lo más esperpénticas. Llegó a emitir un anuncio publicitario en televisión (protagonizado por Sha'Carri Richardson, con guion y edición del propio West) durante las finales de la NBA diciendo que saldría el 23 de julio como fecha definitiva, pero después se aplazó al 6 de agosto, y más tarde al 29.
Pero ayer domingo, por fin, salió el álbum de marras con el título de 'Donda'. Y no han pasado ni veinticuatro horas antes de que estalle la polémica. Entre sus 27 canciones hay colaboraciones de lo más variopintas: Syleena Johnson (en el tema de introducción 'Donda chant') Weeknd y Lil Baby (en la canción 'Hurricane'), Travis Scott y Baby Keem (en 'Praise God'), Fivio Foreign & Playboi Carti ('Off the grid'), Young Thug y el recientemente fallecido Pop Smoke ('Tell the Vision'), Jay Electronica y the Lox ('Jesus Lord'), Conway the Machine, KayCyy & Westside Gunn ('Keep My Spirit Alive'), Kid Cudi ('Moon'), Pusha T, Roddy Ricch y Ariana Grande ('Donda'), Francis and the Lights & JAY-Z ('Jail') y muchos más.
También cuenta con otras dos apariciones que debían ser 'estelares', pero que han acabado siendo de los más polémicas. Se trata de Marilyn Manson y DaBaby, dos artistas que están protagonizando fuertes controversias en los últimos meses, y que fueron invitados a la última fiesta de presentación del disco (ya hubo otras dos hace unos días), celebrada el pasado jueves en un estadio de Chicago en el que West recreó la casa donde nació ante miles de espectadores. La polémica con Manson es bien conocida: está acusado por varias mujeres que aseguran que es un violador y un maltratador. Por su parte, DaBaby hizo comentarios homófobos y comentarios despectivos sobre las víctimas del SIDA en el Rolling Loud Miami en julio, y tras las protestas de internautas y de varias figuras de la industria de la música, fue cancelado en varios festivales y acabó pidiendo perdón.
Precisamente la canción con la colaboración de DaBaby ha sido objeto de la ultimísima polémica de 'Donda'. En la última fiesta de escucha, West reemplazó un verso de Jay-Z en 'Jail' con un nuevo verso de DaBaby, cosa que tiene una explicación: el disco contiene una segunda versión del tema con este último artista. Pero al lanzarse el álbum este domingo, esa versión no aparecía en el repertorio. Horas después se corrigió el 'error', que según West no fue tal. «Universal había lanzado mi disco sin permiso, y había censurado la versión de 'Jail' con DaBaby», dijo ayer el artista en Instagram a las pocas horas de la publicación de 'Donda'.
Respecto a Brian Warner, el nombre real de Marilyn Manson, que aparece como co-compositor de la canción, West lo tiene claro: no se dejará influir por las acusaciones que pesan sobre él. «La voz de Marilyn Manson aparece en Donda y continuará haciéndolo», ha dicho un portavoz del cantante.
'Donda' es la continuación de 'Jesus is king', el álbum que lanzaba Kanye West en 2019 y el álbum con el que el artista ganó el Grammy a Mejor Álbum de Christian Contemporáneo y con el que batió récords al debutar en el número uno en las listas de Álbumes de Rap, en la de Álbumes de Gospel y en el Billboard 200. Sobrepasaba así a The Beatles y se igualaba una vez más con Eminem en la consecución del mayor número de debuts de manera consecutiva en el número uno en toda la historia de las listas, con un total de nueve.

"Kanye West's 'Donda' Album Features Marilyn Manson, Jay-Z, and More","Kanye West surprised his fans on Aug. 29 when he finally dropped his 10th studio album, Donda, after a delay in July. The album, named after West’s late mother, includes 27 songs about Donda West, mental health, and more. Donda also features cameos from more than a dozen artists, but streaming versions of the album do not include the full credits. Here’s the Donda tracklist with all its features, from Marilyn Manson to DaBaby and more.

Kanye West released his new album — sort of
West’s album arrived early on Sunday, Aug. 29, just days after he hosted a third Donda listening party in Chicago. However, according to the rapper, his label, Universal Music Group, released the album without his permission. He took to Instagram to post a statement.
“UNIVERSAL PUT MY ALBUM OUT WITHOUT MY APPROVAL, AND THEY BLOCKED JAIL 2 FROM BEING ON THE ALBUM,” West wrote.
“Jail 2” refers to Donda‘s 24th song, “Jail pt 2,” which DaBaby was supposed to feature on. Listeners could not access the song upon the album’s initial release, but it became available later in the day.
As Pitchfork reported, West also shared some since-deleted screenshots of texts between himself and his manager, Bu Thiam. The messages alleged that DaBaby’s manager did not give the green light to include DaBaby’s verse on the track, given the rapper’s controversy over some of his recent homophobic comments. South Coast Music Group President Arnold Taylor has since disputed West’s texts.
The ‘Donda’ tracklist features multiple artists
In addition to DaBaby’s verse on “Jail pt 2,” Donda features several other artists from various genres. Many listeners believed they heard Ariana Grande‘s vocals on the track “Donda.” However, she has since shot down the rumor by tagging the actual artist, Stalone, in her Instagram Story, according to NME.
According to E!, the track “Believe What I Say” also samples Lauryn Hill’s “Doo Wop (That Thing).” Chris Brown, Jay-Z, and Pop Smoke also appear. The Donda tracklist with features, including DaBaby’s track, can be seen below.
“Donda Chant” (feat. Syleena Johnson) “Jail” (Francis & the Lights, Jay-Z) “God Breathed” (Vory) “Off the Grid” (Playboi Carti, Fivio Foreign) “Hurricane” (Lil Baby, The Weeknd) “Praise God” (Baby Keem, Travis Scott) “Jonah” (Lil Durk, Vory) “Ok Ok” (Fivio Foreign, Lil Yachty) “Junya” (Playboi Carti) “Believe What I Say” (samples Lauryn Hill, no features) “24” (Vory) “Remote Control” (Young Thug) “Moon” (Don Toliver, Kid Cudi) “Heaven and Hell” (no features) “Donda” (Stalone, Tony Williams) “Keep My Spirit Alive” (Conway The Machine, KayCyy, Westside Gunn) “Jesus Lord” (The LOX, Jay Electronica, Swizz Beatz) “New Again” (Chris Brown) “Tell the Vision” (Pop Smoke) “Lord I Need You” (no features) “Pure Souls” (Roddy Ricch, Shenseea) “Come to Life” (no features) “No Child Left Behind” (Sunday Service, Vory) “Jail pt 2” (DaBaby, Marilyn Manson) “Ok Ok pt 2” (Shenseea, Rooga) “Junya pt 2” (Playboi Carti, Ty Dolla Sign) Jesus Lord pt 2″ (no features)

Donda also featured several co-writers, including DaBaby and Manson. Both artists appeared at West’s listening party in Chicago, but the appearances stirred up controversy in light of DaBaby’s comments and the abuse allegations against Manson. However, West reportedly welcomed the backlash, a source told People.
“He knows that having controversial figures around will be provocative and will get people to talking,” the source revealed. “He knows that people are going to be upset and that there will be backlash.”
West might have gotten exactly what he wanted. The source added, “He also knows that people are talking about it today when they wouldn’t have been otherwise.”

""Donda"" chegou aos serviços de streaming no domingo, após duas audições —transmitidas online— e duas datas de lançamento previamente anunciadas.
Durante as primeiras horas de lançamento, a canção ""Jail Pt. 2"", citada por West na publicação do Instagram, não aparecia nas plataformas. Logo depois, porém, passou a constar entre as faixas do álbum.
O álbum sucede, ""Jesus Is King"", que venceu o Grammy neste ano em uma categoria nova, a de melhor disco cristão.",2021-08-30T15:16:00Z,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br,Folha de S.Paulo
Evan Rachel Wood Gives Marilyn Manson the Finger After Kanye Showcase,"Evan Rachel Wood is not a fan of the new Kanye West project, and she had a song of her own — and a digit to go with it — to offer her response.
The singer-actor performed the New Radicals classic “You Get What You Give” during an impromptu performance at Hollywood’s Bourbon Room Saturday night, a song that mentions the name of her ex, rock singer Marilyn Manson, whom she has said has “horrifically abused me for years.” When Manson’s name came up in the lyrics, she put up her middle finger, to cheers from the crowd, as seen in a video of the performance she posted to Instagram.
Without mentioning names, Wood made it clear that her rendition of the song was in response to Manson having been given a platform and a seeming seal of approval by Kanye West, who had the embattled rock star come out along with DaBaby to perform the new song “Jail Pt. 2” during a show Thursday night in Chicago.
“I’ve been saving this but it seems like the appropriate time,” Wood said in introducing her rendition of “You Get What You Give,” accompanied by guitarist Zane Carney.
In posting the video, Wood added the caption, “For my fellow survivors who got slapped in the face this week. I love you. Don’t give up.”
Wood’s performance came the night before West released his “Donda” album, which also includes Manson and DaBaby as featured artists on “Jail Pt. 2.” DaBaby gets an extended verse on the song, which is full of defiance against those who criticized him recently for his homophobic comments; Manson, for his part, only contributes singalong vocals to West’s chorus.
The spontaneous nature of Wood’s performance was reinforced by Carney commenting: “I love you and love that we learned this backstage 3 min before we played it classic EVAN + ZANE moment hahaha! Can’t wait for our next actual (livestream) gig!!!”
The performance took place at a late-night cabaret show populated mostly by members of the cast of “Tarantino Live,” a revue built around songs from Quentin Tarantino films that opened this month at the Bourbon Room on Hollywood Blvd.
Wood has won praise for her singing before, especially as a frequent guest at David Bowie tribute shows in the years following the singer’s death.
Wood and Manson were reported to be in a relationship from 2007-2010, starting when she was 19 and he was 36. She has accused the musician of “grooming” her. Wood gave testimony to Congress about sexual assault in 2018 without naming names. In February of this year, she released a statement that named Manson, writing, “The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson. He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. … I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.”
Four other women have come forward to allege abuse by Manson, who released a statement denying the allegations, writing in February, “My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.” In April, “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco sued him for sexual assault and sexual battery she says took place in 2011. In February, the Los Angeles County sheriff’s department said it was “investigating allegation[s] of domestic violence” involving Manson between 2009-11, but so far criminal charges have not been filed.",2021-08-30T14:53:26Z,https://variety.com,Variety
Kanye West claims Donda was released ‘without his approval’ & label 'BLOCKED' song featuring DaBaby and Marilyn Manson,"KANYE West claims his new Donda album was “released without his permission” and that his label “blocked” the song that features Marilyn Manson and DaBaby.
The rapper shared a scathing Instagram message just minutes after his highly-anticipated record hit streaming platforms - initially excluding the track Jail pt 2.

The Yeezy mogul wrote in all cap bold letters: “Universal put my album out without my approval.
“And they blocked Jail 2 from being on the album.”
Jail pt 2 features DaBaby and Marilyn - who have both been engulfed in controversy in recent months.
Despite DaBaby’s “homophobic” comments and the multiple allegations of rape against Marilyn, Kanye, 44, celebrated the two men in one of his new songs.
However, just as the hip-hop artist publicly shared the Instagram post, the song became available everywhere.
Fans were outraged that Kanye was promoting the alleged sexual predator and DaBaby who doubled down several times on his “homophobic” views.
“He shouldn't have a career because of this song,” one critic wrote.
Another former fan said: “As a longtime fan of you Ye, you lost me with this one. You should be ashamed.”
“There is no excuse anyone can give me to excuse this kind of behavior,” a third insisted.
While a fourth tweeted: “Unnecessary, disappointing & wrong. But sadly not surprising from Kanye at this point. He’s lost.”
Following weeks of Kim Kardashian’s ex teasing the new songs at a few listening parties in both Chicago and Atlanta, fans were finally treated to the full album when it released to streaming services on Sunday.
Donda, which features 26 brand new songs, includes a track titled Jail that finds Kanye dissing Kim, 40, and appreciating the single life.
He raps the lyrics: “Don't you curse at mе on text, why you try to hit the flex?
“I hold up, likе, ‘What?’ I scroll, I scroll up like, ‘Next’
“Guess who's getting 'exed? Like, next. Guess who's getting ‘exed?""
'SINGLE LIFE NOT SO BAD'
He then seems to put Kim on blast for filing for divorce, saying: “You made a choice that's yo' bad, single life ain't so bad.”
Meanwhile, the track Believe What I Say seems to call out Kim for not appreciating what she had with Kanye and all that he did for her.
“I ain't never question what you was askin' for,” the hitmaker blasts. “I gave you every single thing you was askin' for I don't understand how anybody could ask for more.”
He continued: “Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off…Too many family secrets, somebody pass the notes.”
The release of Kanye's long-awaited new album, which is named after his late mother Donda, comes after multiple delays.
One listening party last week featured a shocking appearance by Kim in a wedding gown.
She wore a Balenciaga Couture wedding dress and veil as she joined Kanye on stage for his final song, No Child Left Behind - driving fans wild.
A source later confirmed to TMZ that Kim and Kanye are not back together after having filed for divorce earlier this year, but they are ""forever family"" following their seven-year marriage.

Doublé : Kanye West affirme que son dernier album est sorti sans son accord,"Doublé : Kanye West affirme que son dernier album est sorti sans son accord
Selon le rappeur, c’est sa maison de disques qui a choisi de publier «Donda» et a censuré un morceau conçu avec DaBaby et Marilyn Manson.
Kanye West a fait cette déclaration dimanche soir sur son compte Instagram. Starface
Kanye West accuse les patrons d’Universal d’avoir publié son dixième album, «Donda», sans sa permission. Le disque, qui porte le prénom de sa défunte mère, est sorti sur les plateformes de streaming dimanche 29 août, plusieurs semaines après la date de sortie initiale et après trois soirées d’écoute à Chicago et Atlanta.
Cependant Kanye West a pris la parole sur Instagram dimanche soir pour accuser les responsables de la maison de disques de l’avoir publié prématurément et d’avoir omis une chanson. «Universal a publié mon album sans mon approbation et a empêché «Jail 2» d’être sur l’album», a-t-il écrit en lettres capitales.
Sur la chanson «Jail Pt. 2» apparaissent deux collaborateurs controversés: DaBaby et Marilyn Manson. Le premier a fait l’objet de nombreuses critiques après avoir tenu des propos homophobes au festival Rolling Loud. Marilyn Manson est accusé d’avoir abusé sexuellement de 15 femmes différentes au début de l’année, dont son ex-fiancée Evan Rachel Wood et l’actrice de «Game of Thrones» Esmé Bianco – des allégations qu’il a démenties.
Appel délibéré
Lorsque l’album a été publié sur les services de streaming, la chanson a été initialement omise, mais elle a ensuite été ajoutée à la liste des pistes. Le titre avait été précédemment proposé dans une version avec Jay-Z. Finalement, les deux versions sont disponibles.
Selon «People», une source proche de l’affaire a déclaré que faire appel à des collaborateurs controversés était délibéré. «Il sait que la présence de personnalités controversées sera provocante et fera parler d’elle», a déclaré l’informateur.
D’autres collaborations sur l’album incluent The Weeknd, Young Thug, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi, Ariane Grande et une participation posthume du rappeur Pop Smoke.",2021-08-30T13:59:44Z,https://www.lematin.ch,Le Matin

Evan Rachel Wood blasted her allegedly abusive ex Marilyn Manson after he appeared onstage at Kanye West’s “Donda” event last week.
The “Westworld” star, 33, subtly called out Manson, 52, while performing a cover of New Radicals’ 1998 single “You Get What You Give” with her musical partner Zane Carney on Saturday at the Bourbon Room in Hollywood.
“I’ve been saving this, but it seems like the appropriate time,” she prefaced the song, which includes a reference to the embattled performer.
When Wood reached the part of the track that mentioned Manson’s name, she put up her middle finger as the crowd erupted in cheers.
She shared a clip of her performance on Instagram and addressed the shock rocker’s other alleged victims.
“‘You get what you give,'” she wrote. “For my fellow survivors who got slapped in the face this week. I love you. Don’t give up.”
The “Thirteen” star named Manson as her alleged abuser in February after claiming for years that she had been abused by an unnamed ex.
“He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,” she claimed to Vanity Fair. “I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail.”

Wood is one of 15 women who have come forward to accuse the “Killing Strangers” singer of sexual assault or abuse. Manson has vehemently denied all the allegations, calling them “horrible distortions of reality.”
“My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth,” he wrote on Instagram in February.
West, 44, recently came under fire for inviting Manson and rapper DaBaby — who made homophobic remarks during a festival performance in July — to appear alongside him at the final listening party for his new album, “Donda.”
The “Gold Digger” singer caused even more of an uproar Sunday when “Donda” finally hit streaming services and included a collaboration with both Manson and DaBaby, 29, titled “Jail Pt. 2.”",2021-08-30T12:39:34Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
Evan Rachel Wood : ce qu'elle pense de la collaboration entre Kanye West et Marilyn Manson,"Kanye West a collaboré avec Marilyn Manson sur le titre Jail pt. 2. pour son nouvel album ""Donda"", une collaboration qui a énormément blessé Evan Rachel Wood, laquelle a récemment admis avoir été victime d'abus aux mains du rockeur lorsqu'ils étaient ensemble.
Durant un concert à Chicago, l'actrice a réagit au fait que Marilyn était présent lors de la soirée de lancement de ""Donda"" en brandissant un doigt d'honneur qui a provoqué les applaudissement du public.
Elle a ensuite partagé ce moment sur son compte Instagram.
On peut l'entendre dire : ""J'ai attendu, mais cette occasion me semble appropriée.""
En légende, elle a écrit :""Pour les autres survivantes qui se sont pris une gifle en plein visage cette semaine. Je vous aime. N'abandonnez pas.""
En début d'année, Evan Rachel Wood a également accusé Marilyn Manson d'antisémitisme.
La star de ""Westworld"" a partagé sur Instagram : ""Il m'appelait une juive de façon dérogatoire. Il dessinait des croix gammées sur mon lit quand il était en colère contre moi.""
Evan a aussi confié que le musicien n'était pas seulement discriminatoire à son encontre mais utilisait également des insultes racistes au quotidien.
""J'entendais constamment le mot qui commence par ""n"". Son entourage devait tout le temps rire avec lui ou l'imiter"" a ajouté la star. ""Si vous ne vous joigniez pas à lui ou, pire, si vous le rappeliez à l'ordre, il faisait de vous son souffre-douleur et il vous insultait encore plus.

"""Donda"" de Kanye West sorti sans son accord? Le rappeur accuse Universal","Dans cet opus, qui porte le nom de sa mère décédée en 2007, Kanye West aborde à nouveau des thèmes religieux et fait plusieurs fois référence à sa séparation ultra médiatisée avec Kim Kardashian.
“Universal a sorti mon album sans mon approbation et ils ont bloqué Jail 2 de l’album”, a communiqué Kanye West dans un post Instagram quelques heures après la mise en ligne de “Donda”, sans plus d’explication. Après des semaines de retard et plusieurs séances d’écoute dans des stades bondés, le dixième album du rappeur de 44 ans n’était donc pas (encore) prévu pour tout de suite d’après ses dires.
MUSIQUE - “Universal a sorti mon album sans mon approbation”. Alors que les fans de Kanye West ont enfin pu écouter son opus “Donda” ce dimanche 29 août après de nombreux reports , le rappeur a assuré qu’il n’avait pas donné son accord pour cette sortie surprise des 27 titres qui le compose.
Le morceau Jail 2, cité par l’interprète de “Life of Pablo”, est un titre sur lequel interviennent Marilyn Manson et DaBaby. Les deux artistes controversés étaient déjà apparus aux côtés de Kanye West lors d’une session live au Soldier Field de Chicago, le vendredi 27 août. Le premier est en effet accusé par plusieurs femmes d’agressions sexuelles. Le second, lui, est actuellement sous le feu des critiques pour avoir tenu des propos homophobes.
Le trio s’était réuni sous le porche d’une réplique de la maison d’enfance de Kanye West, maison qui a appartenu à sa mère, Donda West, décédée en 2007. Le rappeur Dababy avait livré un couplet sur une chanson dans laquelle figurait auparavant Jay-Z. Marilyn Manson était, lui, resté muet.
Et si pendant quelques heures après la mise en ligne de l’album “Donda”, le morceau Jail 2 apparaissait effectivement en grisé comme “indisponible” sur certaines plateformes de streaming, ce n’est plus le cas à l’heure où l’on écrit ces lignes. Quelques instants plus tôt, Kanye West avait également partagé des captures d’écran de conversations accusant cette fois le manager de DaBaby de ne pas avoir donné son accord pour la sortie du morceau.
Contacté par le média de référence Variety, Universal n’a pas souhaité commenter officiellement les accusations de Kanye West mais des sources en interne les ont jugé “grotesques”.
Outre Jail 2 et ses invités controversés, The Weeknd, Travis Scott ou Lil Baby figurent également sur cet album, tout comme Chris Brown, condamné en 2009 pour coups et blessures sur la chanteuse Rihanna, qui apparaît comme compositeur et parolier sur le morceau “New Again”.
“Donda” a profondément évolué ces dernières semaines au cours des grandes séances d’écoute publiques organisées à Atlanta, Las Vegas et Chicago. Et Kanye West pourrait bien continuer à le modifier après sa sortie en streaming, comme il l’avait fait pour son album “The Life of Pablo” paru en 2016.

Evan Rachel Wood calls out her ex Marilyn Manson during live performance,"American actor and musician Evan Rachel Wood subtly called out her ex and alleged abuser Marilyn Manson during a recent live performance. As per People magazine, the Golden Globe-nominated star performed a cover of the New Radicals' 1998 single 'You Get What You Give' with her musical partner Zane Carney (of Evan + Zane) on Saturday at the Bourbon Room in Los Angeles.
""I've been saving this but it seems like the appropriate time,"" she prefaced the song, which includes a reference to Manson.

As per People magazine, Wood, a three-time Golden Globe nominee and one-half of the musical duo Evan+Zane, has accused Manson of sexual assault and other abuse. Manson has denied the allegations levelled against him, calling them ""horrible distortions of reality."" Her performance took place after Grammy-winning rapper Kanye West sparked controversy on Thursday by inviting Manson to appear onstage with him at a Chicago listening event in support of his new album 'Donda', which dropped on Sunday.
Manson is listed as a co-writer on two of the tracks on West's 10th studio album 'Donda'. Wood had used her Instagram Story to share an article about Manson's appearance with the words, ""Triggered, re-traumatized, and unsafe"" written across the text.
After first opening up in 2016 about being sexually assaulted by a ""significant other"" and subsequently testifying in support of multiple pieces of legislation that protect survivors of sexual assault, Wood named Manson as her abuser in February 2021. ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,"" Wood wrote at the time in an Instagram post.
""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission.

Kanye West releases 'Donda' with Marilyn Manson and DaBaby,"Maybe he always planned to release it on a Sunday morning.
Kanye West’s new album, “Donda,” finally appeared on streaming services early Sunday, days after a third public listening event for the album — but just in time, perhaps, to suit the LP’s many songs about God and religion.
The song “Jail,” which appears second on the 27-track album — following a brief intro in which a woman repeats “Donda,” West’s late mother’s name, dozens of times — features a verse by the 44-year-old rapper’s mentor-turned-frenemy Jay-Z that West premiered (to the surprise of many) at his first “Donda” event last month.

For the third event, held Thursday night at Chicago’s Soldier Field, West had replaced the Jay-Z verse with one by DaBaby, who recently sparked widespread criticism with homophobic comments. In Chicago, West also invited Marilyn Manson to appear even as the veteran shock rocker is facing multiple lawsuits over accusations of sexual assault and other misconduct.
On Spotify, Manson is credited as a cowriter (under his real name, Brian Warner) on “Jail” and on an additional track, “Jail pt 2,” that features DaBaby as well as a voice that resembles Manson’s.
When the album initially went live on the streaming platform, “Jail pt 2"" was not available to play; early Sunday, West posted an image on Instagram that appears to be a screenshot of a text conversation with his manager, in which the manager tells West that DaBaby’s manager hadn’t cleared DaBaby’s cameo.
Other artists featured on “Donda” — West’s follow-up to 2019’s “Jesus Is King” and his 10th studio LP overall — include the Weeknd, Lil Baby, Playboi Carti, Young Thug, Kid Cudi, Jay Electronica, the Lox and the late Pop Smoke. Chris Brown is credited as a co-writer of one track, “New Again.” Among the producers credited with contributing are Swizz Beatz, Gesaffelstein, Boi-1da and West’s longtime studio accomplice Mike Dean.
“Donda” comes after a tumultuous two years in West’s personal life that saw him launch his roving Sunday Service gospel series, embrace President Trump’s divisive politics — then mount a baffling campaign against Trump for the Oval Office — and separate from his wife, Kim Kardashian, with whom West shares four young children.
Along with Manson and DaBaby, Kardashian appeared at last week’s event in Chicago, where she wore a wedding dress in a kind of reenactment of the couple’s 2014 nuptials.",2021-08-29T19:04:41Z,https://www.latimes.com,Los Angeles Times
Kanye West lança o esperado álbum 'Donda',"Finalmente, Kanye West lançou neste domingo o álbum ""Donda"", que vinha sendo prometido há meses. Ao todo, são 27 faixas, com participações de Jay-Z (em “Jail”), the Weeknd, Jay Electronica, the Lox, Young Thug, the late Pop Smoke, Travis Scott, Lil Baby, Kid Cudi, Lil Durk, Lil Yachty, Baby Keem, Playboi Carti, Ty Dolla $ign, Don Toliver e Fivio Foreign.
Segundo consta nos créditos oficiais, a faixa ""Jail"", que tem participação de Jay-Z, foi composta por Brian Warner (nome verdadeiro de Marilyn Manson). Na faixa ""Jail 2"", Jay-Z foi substituído por DaBaby. Kanye West foi altamente criticado por ter os dois no disco e ainda levá-los a eventos promocionais para badalar o lançamento, já que Manson está sendo processando por diversas agressões e abusos sexuais e DaBaby foi acusado de incitar homofobia.
Idas e vindas
O lançamento de ""Donda"" havia sido anunciado em meados do ano passado, depois que West disse que lançaria um álbum com o nome de ""God´s country"" (""País de Deus"", em tradução llivre). De lá para cá, ele lançou algumas músicas ( “Wash Us in the Blood"", “Believe What I Say”, ""No Child Left Behind""), mas nunca um álbum inteiro.
O plano, depois, acabou sendo lançar ""Donda"" após o primeiro evento de audição em 22 de julho, mas o rapper adiou para 6 de agosto, o que não aconteceu.
A novidade chega em meio a grandes burburinhos na vida pessoal de Kanye West. Recentemente, ele pediu à justiça que seu nome fosse alterado para uma única palavra: Ye. A petição veio meses após a notícia de que ele e Kim Kardashian West estavam se divorciando. Segundo o site ""TMZ"", o casal, no entanto, está ""trabalhando na reconstrução da base do relacionamento"".",2021-08-29T18:28:00Z,https://oglobo.globo.com,O Globo
Kanye West's New Album 'Donda' Has Finally Arrived - Late And With Plenty Of Controversy,"Call it your at-home Sunday Service: Kanye West’s new album, “Donda,” is finally available for your listening pleasure on all streaming platforms.
Weeks after its scheduled launch and multiple stadium-packing listening parties, the rapper released his 10th studio album on Sunday morning named in honor of his mother, Donda West, who died in 2007 following plastic surgery complications.
West initially planned to drop the record in July 2020 before it was pushed back numerous times. The Grammy winner spent the past summer finishing the project and hosting multiple listening parties at venues across the country with the rapper even taking up residence at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium at one point, as he continued working on the songs.
Featuring a sprawling 27 tracks with appearances from West’s “Watch the Throne” collaborator and frenemy Jay-Z, as well as The Weeknd, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi, Lil Yachty, Young Thug and many more, “Donda” arrives two years after the polarizing hip-hop star pivoted to gospel music with his profanity-free record “Jesus Is King.”
On “Donda,” however, West is back to his old tricks: primarily stirring up plenty of controversy by featuring collaborators DaBaby, who’s recently faced major backlash over his homophobic comments, and Marilyn Manson, who’s been accused of sexual abuse by multiple women.
Both men appeared at West’s most recent listening party at Chicago’s Soldier Field on Thursday, where they stood alongside the rapper in coordinating looks, presumably as some sort of commentary about cancel culture.
While Manson is credited as a co-writer on “Jail,” as well as the additional track, “Jail pt 2,” under his legal name Brian Warner, according to Spotify, DaBaby’s verse on the latter song wasn’t initially cleared.
According to texts posted to West’s Instagram on Saturday night, DaBaby’s manager had yet to give the song a green light.
The 22-time Grammy winner, however, came to the rapper’s defense, writing in the texts that he’s “not taking my brother off” because he “was the only person who said he would vote for me in public,” presumably referring to West’s failed and very embarrassing presidential campaign. West apparently got the go-ahead later in the day, as “Jail pt 2” with DaBaby’s verse is now available to stream on all platforms.
The album arrives in the middle of West’s divorce proceedings from Kim Kardashian West, who appeared at his latest listening party to seemingly recreate their nuptials, and the reality TV star gets plenty of shoutouts on the record.
“You made a choice that’s yo’ bad, single life ain’t so bad,” West says on the track “Jail,” while he name-drops another celebrity marriage in peril on “Believe What I Say.”
“I be going through things that I had to wrote/ Celebrity drama that only Brad’d know,” he raps on a separate verse, presumably giving a shoutout to Brad Pitt who’s currently in the midst of a years-long divorce battle with Angelina Jolie. “Too many family secrets, somebody pass the notes.”
Despite the confusion surrounding Kardashian’s bridal moment at the listening event, the pair are reportedly still planning to go through with their divorce.
“They have come a long way since Kim filed for divorce,” an unnamed source told People, noting the display of support was a sign of the bond they share as co-parents to their four children. “It’s taken them months to get to this point. Kim is happy that they get along and that things are amicable.”

Kanye West Finally Releases New Album Donda,"Finally, Kanye West has released his new studio album Donda. It includes contributions from JAY-Z (on “Jail”), the Weeknd, Jay Electronica, the Lox, Young Thug, the late Pop Smoke, Travis Scott, Lil Baby, Kid Cudi, Lil Durk, Lil Yachty, Baby Keem, Playboi Carti, Ty Dolla $ign, Don Toliver, Fivio Foreign, and Chris Brown. Producers include Boi-1da, Mike Dean, E.Vax of Ratatat, 88 Keys, Swizz Beatz, Wheezy, and Gesaffelstein. Listen to Kanye West’s new album Donda, and find the currently available credits, below. (Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)
Around 3:43 p.m. Eastern after the album’s early morning release, West claimed that Universal Music Group (the parent label of Def Jam Recordings and G.O.O.D. Music) released Donda “without [his] approval” and also “blocked ‘Jail, Pt. 2’ from being on the album.” Prior to the allegation, West’s manager Abou “Bu” Thiam (who formerly worked for Def Jam) shared a screenshot of Donda on Instagram, presumably promoting the album’s release. Unnamed sources at Universal, who spoke with Variety, called West’s claim “preposterous.”
Donda arrived after the rapper’s third listening party—a Chicago event that controversially featured appearances from Marilyn Manson and DaBaby. The official credits for “Jail” list Brian Warner (aka Marilyn Manson) as a composer and lyricist. There is a second “Jail,” too, called “Jail, Pt. 2,” which features DaBaby in place of JAY-Z, as well as contributions from Manson and others. West posted a pair of photos on Instagram showing text threads in which he alleges that DaBaby’s manager was not clearing the Charlotte rapper’s verse for “Jail.” Arnold Taylor—the founder and president of South Coast Music Group, the label to which DaBaby is signed—disputed West’s claim.
West first announced Donda last summer, after previously saying that he’d release a new album titled God’s Country. He released “Wash Us in the Blood,” with Travis Scott, and shared different versions of tracklists for the album before teasing another new song called “Believe What I Say.” On July 20, 2021, a few days before the album was first due to arrive, West teased Donda’s “No Child Left Behind” in a Beats ad that featured track star Sha’Carri Richardson. He also sold the Donda Stem Player in conjunction with the album’s release.
West was scheduled to put out Donda following the first listening event on July 22, but postponed the release, announcing a new release date of August 6 via a representative just days later. (The album, of course, did not come out on August 6.) Between the July 22 and August 5 events, West appeared to take up residence within the Atlanta stadium to complete work on the album. He streamed some of the progress ahead of the record’s release, too.
The album arrives amid huge changes in the rapper’s private life. He recently officially filed to have his name legally changed to a single word: Ye. The name change petition came months after the news that he and Kim Kardashian West are divorcing. Kardashian West appeared in the crowd for both Donda events in Atlanta with their children. At the Chicago event, she and West reenacted their wedding. TMZ has also reported that West and Kardashian West are “working on rebuilding the foundation of their relationship.”",2021-08-29T12:20:55Z,https://pitchfork.com,Pitchfork

Kanye West finally releases album Donda after months of delays,"Kanye West has finally released his long-awaited album Donda after months of delays.
The rapper, 44, launched the 27-track record on streaming services after a number of promotional events that did not culminate in the release of new music.
The album, which was initially promised a year ago and has suffered multiple delays, features material from controversial figures Marilyn Manson and DaBaby.
West had said the record would arrive in July, then spent time living at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, where he had held a listening party, while working on completing the record.
At the most recent listening event in Chicago, his estranged wife Kim Kardashian West made a show-stealing cameo, emerging from the audience in a wedding dress months after filing for divorce from the rapper.

West’s 10th studio record is named after his late mother.
The album, a follow-up to 2019’s Jesus Is King, features collaborators including Jay-Z, The Weeknd, Lil Baby, Playboi Carti, Kid Cudi and the late rapper Pop Smoke.
The track Jail, which is the second on the album, features Jay-Z.
At the recent listening event, West had replaced his verse on the track with one by DaBaby, who was recently criticised for homophobic comments made at a music festival.
West appeared to offer an explanation for DaBaby’s absence from the track with screenshots of text messages shared on Instagram.
One screenshot appears to be of a text conversation with one of his representatives, in which West is told that DaBaby’s manager has not cleared the cameo on Jail.
Another screenshot appears to be of text messages between West and DaBaby, in which West tells him the delay is preventing the album from coming out.
Another track, Jail pt 2, does feature a verse by DaBaby.
Both Jail and Jail pt2 give co-writing credit to Brian Warner, the real name of shock rocker Marilyn Manson, who has denied multiple allegations of sexual assault and who made a surprise appearance alongside West and DaBaby at the recent event in Chicago.

"Kim Kardashian ""Isn't Happy"" About Kanye West Bringing Out Marilyn Manson: Report","Ye hosted his third listening party for DONDA on Thursday which he made sure would rattle the Internet. The rapper brought out DaBaby, who has been engulfed in controversy this month over homophobic remarks made at Rolling Loud, and Marilyn Manson, the shock-rocker who is facing multiple lawsuits related to sexual abuse. Needless to say, people weren't pleased about the people 'Ye chose to align himself with.
At the end of the performance, Kanye did the unthinkable -- remove his mask. Kim Kardashian emerged in a Balenciaga wedding dress before 'Ye removed his mask, smiled, and exited the field hand-in-hand with the mother of his four children. However, it seems that she was only aware of her role in the evening.
According to People, Kim Kardashian ""missed"" the appearances of DaBaby and Marilyn Manson as she was seated in a suite that faced the back of Kanye's childhood home. The source said that Kim wasn't in the loop about 'Ye's decision to bring out Marilyn Manson.
""She was seated inside a suite facing the back of the house on the stage so she would not have been able to see them at all from her vantage point,"" the source said. ""She wasn't in the loop at all about what was happening at the show. She was only aware of what Kanye had asked her to do, and she was willing to help him.""
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have reportedly been working on their marriage behind the scenes in an attempt to make it work. Naturally, Kim has been supportive of 'Ye's endeavors, regardless of what it is. However, there's a limitation to what she's willing to support when it comes to 'Ye's ever-changing plans.
""Kanye will always be family to Kim. When Kanye is doing well and is happy, it benefits the kids,"" another source said. ""Kim is the first one to support his visions. He asked her to be part of the listening event and she said yes without hesitation. She didn't know that Marilyn Manson would be there too. She understands why there is backlash. Kim is all about positive publicity. She would have never participated if she knew Manson would be there.""
Ultimately, another source said that Kim's only intention was to support Kanye West and was caught by ""surprise"" after hearing about Manson and DaBaby stand alongside him.
""A lot of it took her by surprise,"" a source said. ""But then you have to decide: Do you bail at the last minute, or do you do what you agreed to do? In the end, she decided to stay and fulfill her promise. That doesn't mean that she supports Marilyn Mansion or DaBaby and the things they believe. She was there to support the father of her children.""
Marilyn Manson and DaBaby have both contributed to DONDA with the latter blasphemously replacing Jay-Z's verse on the tentatively titled, ""Jail.""

Kim Kardashian was 'very upset' Marilyn Manson appeared with Kanye West at Donda party after sexual assault claims,"KIM Kardashian is not happy that Marilyn Manson appeared with her ex-husband Kanye West at his Donda listening event.
The rapper, 44, hosted an event to mark the release of his latest album at Soldier Field in Chicago on Thursday.

The star made a bold statement by bringing on his ex Kim, who walked on stage in a wedding dress.
During the show, Ye was also controversially seen with singer-songwriter Marilyn Manson and 29-year-old rapper DaBaby outside a mock-up of Kanye's childhood home on stage.
However, a source told E! News that Kim is ""very upset"" about Marilyn's involvement in the show and had no idea he would be there prior to arriving.
The source explained: ""She would never have participated in something if she knew Manson was a part of it.""
The 52-year-old heavy metal artist, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, is facing four ongoing sexual assault cases with 16 women having accused him of sexual and psychological abuse.
Marilyn has denied the accusations.
Kim was also allegedly unaware that DaBaby would be present at the show, and was said to be ""blindsided"" by Kanye's decision to include him.
The rapper has been widely condemned online for comments he made during a performance on Sunday, July 25, 2021.
DaBaby came under fire in July for going on an explicit rant regarding HIV and ""sucking d**k.""
The rapper has since been dragged for spreading misinformation about HIV and AIDS, alongside stigmatizing the illness.
Despite Kim's unhappiness, Kanye reportedly wasn't too understanding, with a source saying: ""He wants her to realize why he included them and appreciate the art form.
""Kanye wanted a reaction. He wants people talking about his album and that was the approach he was taking.""
Kim filed for divorce from Kanye, 44, back in February.
The two share their four children: North, eight, Saint, five, Chicago, three, and Psalm, two.
The former couple filed for joint and physical custody of their four kids.

Kim Kardashian 'didn't know' Marilyn Manson would be present at Kanye West's 'Donda' event,"As Kanye West's Thursday 'Donda' event garnered widespread backlash for his collaboration with accused sexual abuser Marilyn Manson, sources have revealed that Kim Kardashian West didn't know regarding Manson's participation in the listening event. As per People magazine, during the event at Chicago's Soldier Field, the third listening party for West's upcoming album 'Donda', Manson, unexpectedly appeared on the porch of a replica of West's childhood home on stage.
Manson, who is facing four sexual abuse lawsuits and has been accused by more than 15 women of sexual assault, did not perform, though a spokesperson for the musician told People magazine that his voice is featured on the new album. Manson has previously denied the sexual abuse allegations.
West also faced criticism for including DaBaby in the event, less than a month after the rapper came under fire for making homophobic remarks about the LGBTQ+ community. He has since apologized. Kardashian West, who attended the listening party and at one point came on stage for recreation of her 2014 wedding to West, ""missed"" both Manson and DaBaby's appearances, one source said.
""She was seated inside a suite facing the back of the house on the stage so she would not have been able to see them at all from her vantage point. She wasn't in the loop at all about what was happening at the show. She was only aware of what Kanye had asked her to do, and she was willing to help him,"" the source said. Another insider added that while the 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' star wants to be supportive of her ex, she ""isn't happy"" with him.
""Kanye will always be family to Kim. When Kanye is doing well and is happy, it benefits the kids. Kim is the first one to support his visions. He asked her to be part of the listening event and she said yes without hesitation. She didn't know that Marilyn Manson would be there too,"" the insider said. Continuing further, the insider added, ""She understands why there is backlash. Kim is all about positive publicity. She would have never participated if she knew Manson would be there.""
A third source said Kardashian West, who has since returned to Los Angeles without West, ""wasn't clued in on everything that was going to happen."" The source said, ""A lot of it took her by surprise. But then you have to decide: Do you bail at the last minute, or do you do what you agreed to do? In the end, she decided to stay and fulfill her promise. That doesn't mean that she supports Marilyn Manson or DaBaby and the things they believe. She was there to support the father of her children.""
Kardashian filed for divorce from West in February after almost seven years of marriage. The two share four children: daughters North and Chicago, plus sons Saint and Psalm, whom Kardashian West brought along to all of the recent listening parties. As for Kardashian West's onstage appearance, the third source said West wanted to honor his nuptials with the reality star.
""The wedding was a significant moment in Ye's life, which he says was one of the purest things he's ever done. So he wanted to commemorate that,"" the source said, as per People magazine. (ANI)

Kanye West to collaborate with Marilyn Manson on 'Donda' album amid rocker's sexual assault cases,"Grammy-winning artist Kanye West is collaborating with Marilyn Manson on the rapper's upcoming album 'Donda', despite the rocker facing allegations of sexual abuse and physical violence from more than 15 women. Hours after Manson appeared onstage alongside West at his 'Donda' listening party at Chicago's Soldier Field, a spokesperson for Manson told People magazine that the rocker and rapper will continue to work together on the release of West's new album.
""Marilyn Manson's voice is featured on DONDA. And he will continue to conceptually collaborate with Ye on the DONDA project,"" the spokesperson said. The new collaboration between Manson and West, who seemed to previously sample the rocker's song 'The Beautiful People' on 'Black Skinhead', comes as the rocker faces accusations of sexual abuse and domestic violence from more than 15 women, including actors Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco.
The singer has denied the allegations and has not been charged with any crime till now. Bianco is also one of four women who have sued the singer for sexual abuse. Along with accusing him of physical violence and sexual assault, Bianco and Manson's ex-girlfriend Ashley Morgan Smithline also accused the singer of sex trafficking.
""I live in constant fear even to this day,"" Smithline told People magazine after filing her lawsuit against Manson. ""I am seeking justice because I want to move forward and heal from the terrible abuse I faced. I want Brian Warner to be held accountable once and for all,"" she added at the time.
As for 'Donda', West hosted a third listening party for the unreleased album on Thursday where he welcomed Manson and DaBaby, who was recently under fire for homophobic comments at a concert on stage. 'Donda' is named after the Grammy winner's late mother Donda West, who died at the age of 58 following plastic surgery complications in 2007. (ANI)

"Marilyn Manson Will Reportedly Be Featured On Kanye West's ""DONDA""","Kanye West's third DONDA release party went down in Chicago on Thursday night and while fans were expecting a classic, they ended up getting a revised version of the album in which Kid Cudi, Pusha T, and Jay Z were nowhere to be found. For many, this was very disappointing, especially when you consider how Jay's verse was replaced by a DaBaby feature.DaBaby hasn't been the most popular man in the world as of late, and some felt like his inclusion was a bit distasteful.
This train of thought also extended to Kanye's decision to have Marilyn Manson accompany him on the stoop to his recreated childhood home. Manson has been accused of rape and sexual assault over the past year, and fans felt like it was a poor choice to have him represent an album that is meant to be dedicated to Kanye's mother.

In a report from People magazine, it was revealed by Manson's rep that ""Marilyn Manson’s voice is featured on Donda, and he will continue to conceptually collaborate with Ye on the Donda project."" During the listening event, we did not hear Manson's voice, although based on this commentary, that should change between now and the official release.
Another story from People claims that Kanye is looking to stir the pot with these cameos and that he is trying to get people talking about the album. While it's a strategy that works, it could very well cost him some supporters.
Now, reports are surfacing that the album has been loaded into DSP's although there is no guarantee that it will, indeed, drop within the next 24 hours. It's been a rollercoaster ride of emotions, so stay tuned for more updates.

In fact, several people are disappointed by Ye's decision to use his latest listening event to shine a spotlight on DaBaby and Marilyn Manson, who have recently been the subject of homophobic controversy and sexual assault allegations, respectively.
It turns out that Kanye isn't the only person under fire for their association with Marilyn Manson at the DONDA listening event at Soldier Field. Legendary R&B singer and multi-instrumentalist Raphael Saadiq has unexpectedly found himself in the hot seat after sharing an Instagram post in which he posted alongside the controversial rock star.

Upon posting the picture, he started to receive a bunch of unexpected backlash, which prompted him to educate himself on Manson's current sexual assault allegations.
Now, Raphael Saadiq has come forward to address the controversial social media post by apologizing to his fans and clapping back at trolls who were spamming his page with negative and hurtful comments.
""I'm taking this post down today, I wasn't aware of his allegations, so please forgive the post,"" the former Tony! Toni! Toné! member explained. "" I wouldn’t want to offend anyone who’s been abused,but I want to say this, most of the people whom I’ve never seen on this page, I’m a very positive brother who only post love and positive music, but you MF don’t ring my bell for positive post, I guess that’s why negative shit is so popular.""
He continued, saying, ""Y'all sit around and wait for shit like this, my post and views are very low numbers, and I like it like that, but as soon as it something y’all don’t like, Millions of new people hit the page, y’all should try ring my bell for all the positive things, click on a good song or a beautiful positive waterfall or mountains, but y’all go straight crickets for Gods creative nature, who’s really the DEVIL!!!

"Kanye West sparks controversy after inviting DaBaby, Marilyn Manson on stage during 'Donda' listening party","Kanye West flabbergasted fans at yet another listening party Thursday night after inviting controversial musicians DaBaby and Marilyn Manson on stage with him.
West's third listening party for his yet-to-be-released album ""Donda"" featured a replica of his childhood home in the middle of Chicago's Soldier Field. Kim Kardashian, who filed from divorce from West in February, also made an appearance.
The artist — just as he did at two shows at Atlanta's Mercedes Benz Stadium — danced to, but did not perform the album, which was originally set to be released on July 23. West, who is in the process of changing his legal name to ""Ye,"" spent most of the show in a full face mask.
DaBaby, who recently faced widespread backlash after making homophobic comments about people living with HIV/AIDS, is featured on a song that had originally included Jay-Z.
It wasn't immediately clear why Manson, who faces accusations and lawsuits from several women alleging sexual assault and abuse, was invited on stage.
A representative for Manson told NBC News Friday that his voice is featured on Donda, ""and he will continue to conceptually collaborate with Ye on the Donda project.""
Some on social media poked fun at the appearances, while others condemned West's choice to include those two particular artists.
""Kanye about to assemble the cancelled avengers with DaBaby and Marilyn Manson,"" one person wrote.
Others surmised Manson probably wasn't too fond of West's more religious tracks.

For his last stunner, Kardashian appeared on stage in a wedding dress and veil. West, finally mask-less, greeted her with a few words and a huge smile.

Kanye West Stirs Controversy By Sharing Stage With Marilyn Manson,"Two guest appearances at Kanye West’s Thursday-night listening party for his upcoming “Donda” album has some observers questioning whether he was making a bizarre statement about “cancel culture.”
That’s because one of the “highlights” ― or “lowlights” ― of West’s event at Chicago’s Soldier Field was when he was joined onstage by rocker Marilyn Manson and fellow rapper DaBaby.
The two controversial entertainment figures joined West for his opening number dressed, like the rapper, in all-black outfits on a set built to look like a porch of a churchlike structure.

Manson was recently charged with assaulting a photographer in 2019 and has been accused of abuse by 15 former girlfriends.
Meanwhile, DaBaby has faced a wave of backlash after making homophobic remarks onstage at the Rolling Loud music festival last month.

Marilyn Manson te horen op album van Kanye West,"Marilyn Manson heeft meegewerkt aan Donda, het langverwachte tiende studioalbum van Kanye West. De Amerikaanse shockrocker is te horen op de plaat, zo bevestigt Mansons manager aan Newsweek.
De zanger stond donderdag op het podium tijdens de derde luistersessie die West voor zijn nieuwe album hield. De rol van Manson was nog niet bekend, maar zijn aanwezigheid zorgde al voor ophef. De zanger wordt namelijk door meerdere vrouwen beschuldigd van seksueel misbruik. Ook het feit dat rapper DaBaby, die onlangs commotie veroorzaakte vanwege homofobe uitspraken, van de partij was zorgde voor kritische reacties op social media.
De manager van Manson geeft verder geen details over diens exacte bijdrage aan Donda. Wel zegt de zegsman dat de zanger met de rapper ""blijft samenwerken"" aan het project.
Daarmee lijkt de manager te bevestigen dat West wederom verder gaat sleutelen aan zijn album.

The highly anticipated album has not yet been released and Mason's input was not revealed until now.
Newsweek has contacted West's representatives for further comment on Manson's collaboration.
Taking place in Chicago's Soldier Field stadium, almost 40,000 people witnessed West share the stage with Manson as well as DaBaby.
The ""Tainted Love"" singer is facing multiple allegations of sexual, physical and emotional abuse from his former partners including Westworld actress Evan Rachel Wood and Esmé Bianco from Game of Thrones.
""I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail,"" Wood wrote in an Instagram post. ""I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent.""
Bianco labeled the rock star—whose real name is Brian Warner — as a ""monster who almost destroyed me and almost destroyed so many women.""
She told The Cut: ""I basically felt like a prisoner. I came and went at his pleasure. Who I spoke to was completely controlled by him. I called my family hiding in the closet.""
As of June this year, the musician is facing four sexual assault lawsuits. He has denied all the allegations against him.
Addressing the situation on Instagram earlier this year, Manson wrote: ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality.
""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how—and why—others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
Manson was joined by another masked figure at the Donda event who was revealed to be DaBaby. He was recently dropped from a number of festival lineups due to homophobic comments he made at Rolling Loud festival.
Despite the huge fanfare and three listening events, West's 10th studio album is still not available to buy, stream or download.
Last week, the ""Jesus Is King"" hitmaker's manager promised fans the album would drop Friday, August 27 but so far there is still no sign of it.",2021-08-27T14:47:37Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
Polêmica: Kanye West convida DaBaby e Marilyn Manson para audição de disco,"Polêmica: Kanye West convida DaBaby e Marilyn Manson para audição de disco
Rapper aparece ao lado dos cantores durante transmissão de promoção de seu novo álbum, 'Donda'
Kanye West causou polêmica nesta quinta-feira (27) durante a transmissão da produção do novo álbum ""Donda"", ao trazer para o evento Marilyn Manson, que está sendo acusado na justiça de múltiplas agressões sexuais e abuso, e DaBaby, que recentemente proferiu homofóbicas e acabou duramente criticado na web.
As imagens foram transmitidas pela Apple Music e rapidamente viralizaram nas redes sociais. Kanye aparece com Marilyn e DaBaby no cenário da igreja que o rapper construiu no centro do estádio em que está gravando Donda. Alguns fãs chegaram a notar semelhança da estrutura com a casa que ele morou na infância.
Transmitido diretamente do Soldier Field, em Chicago, a audição começou com a faixa “Jail”, que originalmente continha versos de Jay-Z, o que representava uma reconciliação entre os dois. Porém, Kanye resolveu mudar a canção e escalar DaBaby no lugar de Jay-Z.
Além de DaBaby e Marilyn Manson, figuras importantes como Travis Scott e Shensea estavam presentes no evento. Contudo, quem realmente chamou a atenção do público foi Kim Kardashian, que subiu ao palco vestida de noiva, com um véu cobrindo seu rosto e foi ao encontro de seu ex-marido.",2021-08-27T14:08:55Z,https://www.otempo.com.br,O Tempo
"Kanye West's latest listening event featured Marilyn Manson, DaBaby, and Kim in a wedding dress","(CNN) Kanye West's latest ""DONDA"" listening party featured him leaving the stage hand in hand with Kim Kardashian West in a wedding dress.
West appeared at Chicago's Soldier Field for his third listening party, where he had a replica built of his childhood home. But that was just the beginning.
Throughout the event, Kanye wore all black and had his face covered by a mask. He brought out special guests Marilyn Manson and DaBaby , who have both been under scrutiny in the news recently. Manson is facing sexual assault and abuse accusations from women, which he has denied, and DaBaby was caught up in a controversy around homophobic comments he has since apologized for.

He was then met by a bride with a veil over her face who turned out to be Kardashian West, who filed for divorce from West in February. Kylie Jenner shared the moment in her Instagram stories. West and Kardashian left the venue holding hands as the finale.

"Kanye West sets himself on fire, remarries Kim at 'Donda' listening party","The Kanye West circus continued on Thursday night — with a new added attraction: Watch Ye set himself on fire!
Yup, that’s right. At the latest in a string of “Donda” listening parties — this one, at Soldier Field in his hometown of Chicago — West set himself on fire in a blazingly bizarre stunt that, thankfully, was just that: a stunt.
The fireworks happened at the end while the rapper was in front of a replica of his childhood home that was used to symbolize his upbringing with his beloved late mom, Donda West, who inspired the title of her son’s 10th studio album — which once again was not released, as teased, following the event.
But the fire fiasco wasn’t the only trainwreck-in-motion moment at the listening party, which followed previous ones at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, where West, 44, has reportedly been holed up to finish “Donda.”

There was also West’s ex, Kim Kardashian, appearing on stage in a white Balenciaga Couture wedding dress, as the estranged couple re-created their 2014 nuptials during “No Child Left Behind.”
Kanye West and ex Kim Kardashian recreated their 2014 wedding at his “Donda” listening party in Chicago on Thursday night.
And then there were the appearances by two controversial figures in Marilyn Manson and DaBaby. West brought out shock rocker Manson, who earlier this year was dropped by his label — and canceled by the rest of the music industry — after a number of women accused him of physically, mentally and sexually abusing them.

The rapper DaBaby — whose homophobic rant at Rolling Loud in Miami earlier this month has led him to be dropped from other festivals — also showed up, appearing to replace Jay-Z’s verse on a “Donda” track that was previously heard at the first Mercedes-Benz Stadium listening party.

Another artist, Lauryn Hill, made a buzzed-about appearance, but only in a sample of her hit “Doo Wop (That Thing)” — from her 1998 classic “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” — on one of the “Donda” tracks.
But at this point it’s hard to know if West’s album will ever come out — or if these stadium-size listening parties are just a way for him to rake in some big bucks from fans in the meantime.",2021-08-27T13:33:55Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
Kanye West holt Marilyn Manson auf die Bühne,"Kanye West scheut sich nicht vor kontroversen Schlagzeilen. Das hat der Rapper auch mit seinem jüngsten Auftritt bewiesen. Er holte Marilyn Manson und DaBaby auf die Bühne.

10/11 Kanye West stellt die Geduld seiner Fans mit den Performances auf die Probe.
11/11 In diesem Raum wohnte West in der Mercedes-Benz-Arena, während er das Album fertigstellen wollte.
Kanye West (44) will Aufmerksamkeit für sein neues Album «Donda»! Bereits zum dritten Mal hat der Rapper das Werk mit grossem Aufwand vorgestellt – ohne es danach zu veröffentlichen. Dieses Mal hielt er die «Listening Party» – also einen Event, bei dem das Album lediglich vorgespielt wird – in dem Soldier-Field-Stadion in Chicago ab. Wie verbunden West mit seiner Heimatstadt immer noch ist, zeigte auch das Bühnendekor. Der Rapper liess das Haus, in dem er aufgewachsen ist, komplett nachbauen.
Auf den Stufen des Hauses zeigte sich während der Show aber dann nicht nur West selbst. Der Rapper hatte zwei äusserst kontroverse Gäste dabei: Marilyn Manson (52) und DaBaby (29). Besonders Mansons Anwesenheit sorgte selbst bei eingefleischten West-Fans für Stirnrunzeln. Denn der Schock-Rocker war in letzter Zeit nicht mit seiner Musik in den Schlagzeilen, sondern mit schweren Vorwürfen gegen ihn. Mehrere Frauen, darunter etwa seine Ex-Freundin Evan Rachel Wood (33) oder die «Game of Thrones»-Schauspielerin Esmé Bianco (39), werfen Manson vor, sie sexuell missbraucht und psychisch manipuliert zu haben. Bianco legte sogar eine Zivilklage gegen Manson ein – unter anderem wegen Vergewaltigung.
Erster öffentlicher Auftritt von Manson
Die Anschuldigungen und der darauf folgende Shitstorm hatten Folgen: Manson wurde von seiner Plattenfirma fallen gelassen, als Schauspieler wurde er aus bereits abgedrehten Produktionen rausgeschnitten. Der Schock-Rocker wurde danach nicht mehr in der Öffentlichkeit gesehen – bis jetzt. Während West an der Listening Party seine neuen Lieder abspielte, stand Manson im Stadion verloren auf den Stufen von Wests nachgebautem Haus seiner Kindheit.
Besonders bizarr: West betont in seiner Musik immer wieder seinen christlichen Glauben. Auch auf seinem neuen Album finden sich Zeilen wie: «Ihr braucht alle Gott.» Auf seinem ehemaligen Zuhause stand während des Events gar ein grosses Kreuz. Manson hingegen nennt sich selbst den «Antichrist Superstar» und verbrannte schon Bibeln auf der Bühne. Was die Musiker aber gemeinsamen haben, wie auch dieser Auftritt zeigt: Beide lieben die Kontroverse.
Homophobe Aussagen
Die Anwesenheit von DaBaby machte etwas mehr Sinn. Schliesslich ist der Rapper auch auf dem Album vertreten. Dennoch sorgte der Auftritt für Aufsehen. Denn DaBaby steht zurzeit in der Kritik, weil er sich während einer Festival-Performance homophob äusserte. Entschuldigen wollte sich der Rapper zunächst nicht, entschied sich dann doch dazu, löschte aber die Entschuldigung dann wieder. Seine Kritiker nannte er nach den schwulenfeindlichen Äusserungen «weinende Babys».",2021-08-27T12:46:22Z,https://www.blick.ch,BLICK.CH
"Inside Kanye West’s DONDA listening party with Marilyn Manson, DaBaby and ex wife Kim Kardashian","KANYE West threw an epic listening party for his upcoming album Donda, named after his late mother, last night, which saw him set himself on fire and his ex-wife Kim Kardashian dress in a wedding gown.

An illuminated cross was on top of the building, and there were candles stuck in a dirt mound all around.
In traditional Kanye fashion, the 44-year-old rapper was 90 minutes late for his show, which offered attendees coronavirus vaccinations outside of the venue.
But he pulled out all of the stops when he finally did make an appearance, first seen pacing on the porch of the house in an all-black outfit before he lit himself on fire.
The blaze began inside of the home, with the Gold Digger hitmaker sitting perfectly still as the flames consumed him, dressed in protective gear he calmly walked outside - much to the shock of the live audience.
Members of the crew used fire extinguishers to put him out, and there were homages to his family life with Kim in the rest of the set.
The voice of his mother Donda, who passed away in 2007, repeating her name opened the show, and what looked like two of his and Kim's four children could be seen inside the house.
Kim wore a Balenciaga Couture wedding dress and veil as she joined Kanye on stage for his final song, No Child Left Behind - driving fans wild.
A source later confirmed to TMZ that Kim and Kanye are not back together, but they are ""forever family"" following their seven-year marriage.
The insider shared: ""Kim and Kanye have always supported the other's endeavors and will continue to do that in the future, whether it be a collaborative effort or not. Kim was happy to do it for Kanye and the event, which was so important to him.""
Kim also bought their four children, eight-year-old North, five-year-old Saint, three-year-old Chicago, and two-year-old Psalm along to the event.
But more controversial special guests were also in attendance, with Marilyn Manson and DaBaby brought out on stage as Kanye appeared to publicly declare his support for them.
Manson is at the centre of ongoing sexual assault allegations for more than a dozen women, and DaBaby sparked outrage last month when he went on a homophobic rant about AIDs at a music festival.
Attendees at the show-stopping event were also able to get their hands on Kanye's latest merchandise, including clothing with ""2024"" and a presidential seal emblazoned across it, and some with a baby photo of him on the front, and an image of the house on the back.
It was also live-streamed on Apple Music, and is the third event that Kanye has held to plug the upcoming album - which was originally due for release on 23 July.

"Kanye West's Chicago listening party features Marilyn Manson, DaBaby, Kim Kardashian and setting himself on fire","Certainly, it’s a performance. But is it empty? A grand creative gesture alone can sometimes seem to be enough for Kanye — and I’m OK with that. He writes a three-story love letter to Chicago and drapes it over the old Gap on Michigan Avenue. He sells flimsy T-shirts for hundreds of dollars at a pop-up store in Northbrook and leaves you wondering about want and greed. He tours with a stage that floats over the audience but leaves himself mostly in the dark. You imagine no one is telling him what is and what is not a smart idea, and so the man is failing and succeeding in public, all the time. And it’s exciting. And annoying. How was “Donda”? The album? Dark, kind of grim, not all that catchy, full of flotsam and full of transcendence. But you probably had to be there.",2021-08-27T11:56:37Z,https://www.chicagotribune.com,Chicago Tribune
"Kanye West Criticized for Including Marilyn Manson, DaBaby at 'Donda' Event","Marilyn Manson and DaBaby were brought on stage by Kanye West at the rapper's Chicago listening party on Thursday night in a move that has been widely criticized on social media.
In what appeared to be a sort of commentary on so-called ""cancel culture,"" the rapper included the two performers, who have both been in the news for negative reasons in recent months.

Taking place at Chicago's Soldier Field, almost 40,000 people attended for the latest ""Donda Listening Experience"" ahead of the highly anticipated album release.
The spectacle even saw West light himself on fire at one point.
During one part of the show, West performed in what is thought to be a replica of his childhood home. He was joined on the porch by Manson and DaBaby.
DaBaby raps a guest verse on a song, rumored to be called ""Jail."" The version performed on Thursday seems to be different from the one played at two previous events featuring Jay-Z.
It's not clear if Manson has contributed to the project, but West's decision to include the musician is controversial.
Manson has been accused of abuse by multiple women, including actresses Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco. He has denied the allegations.
The ""Fight Song"" performer was dropped by his record label in February after the Westworld actress Wood claimed that the singer had ""horrifically abused"" her during their relationship.
Meanwhile, DaBaby has been widely condemned for his homophobic comments that have seen him dropped from multiple festival lineups.
Their inclusion has prompted some outrage from fans.

"Kanye West Testifies, Trolls and Sets Himself on Fire at 'Donda' Event","It’s been a full month, and the tale of Kanye West’s traveling listening event continues. On Thursday night, West — or “Ye” as he legally petitioned to change his name earlier this week — rented out another gigantic venue to play what many hope (but few expect) to be the final version of his tenth studio album, “Donda.” However, instead of continuing his residency in Atlanta’s Mercedes Benz Arena, West went home, both literally and figuratively, by recreating his childhood house in the center of Chicago’s Soldier Field.
And in many ways, the event brought back the brash, trolling Kanye of recent years: The showed opened with a song apparently titled “Jail” that featured a fiery verse by Jay-Z — but on Thursday, Jay’s verse was replaced with an entirely new one by DaBaby, who addressed the firestorm of criticism leveled against his recent homophobic comments. As if that weren’t enough a few minutes later Marilyn Manson, who is accused of sexual assault or misconduct by multiple women, joined West on the “stage” — basically the porch of the house — for much of the concert. And the event ended with West staging a mock-marriage to a woman who was apparently Kim Kardashian. Yet it also featured heavy themes of religion and impassioned calls for prison reform. Such is the dichotomy of Kanye West.
With a capacity of 61,500, the stadium appeared full, even over a digitized Apple Music livestream. Like many things Kanye, the road back to Chicago for his third “Donda” listening event has been as confusing and complex as the album’s development. “Donda” has gone from an unfinished collection of rough raps played for a small audience on Las Vegas to three different, ever-evolving, seemingly completed albums in just over a month. From the storylines of Mike Dean getting harassed on social media to the reignition of public animosity between Drake and Kanye, the rollout for “Donda” has nearly diluted the content that was meant to come out of it. Yet, there we were are here we are, still listening.
Regardless of the circus around it, a side narrative is how lucrative the events themselves have been. According to estimates by Vice, Billboard and others, West is grossing millions in merch and ticket sales and streaming revenue from each event, although the increasingly elaborate staging — Thursday’s event also featured hundreds of dancers and three dozen-ish cars and trucks — is likely to make a significant dent in those earnings. (Not that it matters to West, who was recently declared a billionaire and has never spared expense for his art.) All for an album that, at the time of this article’s publication, has not officially been released.
Not surprisingly, considering the increasingly religious nature of West’s music, the three “Donda” events have felt evangelical in nature, although less so than his most recent album, “Jesus Is King” and his church-like “Sunday Service” events. The first one in Atlanta found West walking and stomping aimlessly walking across a white floor as the music played — occasionally running, sometimes pausing, but never really going anywhere. This was him in limbo, trying to figure out where he, and presumably the album, would go next.
The second event was a spectable: starkly different from the first, with a flash mob circling him like a living black hole and the roof of the Mercedes Benz arena filled with halo light before Kanye rose into the sky. The show ended and climaxed with his ascent into heaven, rejoining his mother while the rapper Vory’s vocals boomed on the song “No Child Left Behind.” This event found him crash-landed back on Earth — as shown in a video that was played during the event — returning to the place his journey began: Donda’s house in Chicago with a glowing cross above it and shrouded by fog.
There was no shortage of questions looming over the event — Would the third time be the charm and “Donda” would actually be released? Would he overhaul the album completely again? Would he finally take off his mask, symbolizing the project’s completion? — and although the answers to those questions were no, yes and yes, it also raised several others. The show started over two hours after its 9 p.m. ET call-time, with fans getting so restless that there are even videos of them jumping bombarding the vending tents to snag some coveted “Donda” merchandise being sold. For a long time, the only image we livestream viewers had was that of Donda’s sanctuary. “Wake up, Mr. West” could be heard being yelled by one attendee, and eventually chants of “Yeezy” erupted. Then, at 11:50 p.m., the spectacle began with Kanye emerging from the home with two of his children as the “Donda” interlude bellowed through the stadium.
The outrage that West deliberately set off by opening the show with appearances from an apparent homophobe and an alleged sex offender — DaBaby and Manson — tainted the experience for many, and makes an objective assessment challenging, although the intensity did level off… well, until he set himself on fire toward the end of the show, emerging from the house and walking around in a fire-resistant suit until a stagehand doused him with a fire extinguisher that had been sitting next to the house for the entire evening. Throughout the show, as an army of people clad in “Donda” vests circle the replica home, with black SUVs and cruisers at their side, West was joined on the porch of the house by several artists featured on the album, from Don Tolliver to Westside Gunn, Shensea, Rooga, and even Larry Hoover Jr., whose gave an impassioned spoken-word passage on the album to free his father after decades in prison. left a message on the tape to free his father, Larry Hoover.
West made some solid additions to this version of “Donda” — including the full version to his Lauryn Hill “Doo Wap (That Thing)”-sampled song, “Believe What I Say” that he previewed in September of last year and adding a few impressive tracks — and it sounds better sonically. But the sequencing of songs was awkward and rigid, he’d removed stellar camos from Jay-Z, The Lox, Conway the Machine, Pusha T, and a series of other artists, and even now, the album still feels unfinished. He and Mike Dean have probably been reworking it since the show ended.
Anyone who missed the trolling West — who, apart from sparring with Drake, has been absent in recent weeks — has him back. And if the merch being sold at the event is any indication of where his mind is at the moment, he still has his sights set on another presidential run, with “2024” scribed on the back of shirts. And it remains unclear whether his public embraces of DaBaby and Manson are sheer provocation, statements of embracing sinners, empathy with controversial figures, or all three, or none.
The music and gimmicks might have changed, but the man behind the mask remains the same — even though he finally removed his mask during the wedding scene at the end of the show, it felt like the ending to a different movie.
What comes next is anyone’s guess. But if Thursday-into-Friday’s “Donda” event is any indication, millions will be waiting and watching.

"Kanye West Invites Marilyn Manson and DaBaby to 'Donda' Event, Kim Kardashian Appears in Wedding Dress","Kanye West has courted controversy by inviting Marilyn Manson and DaBaby to his Donda listening party. The rapper, who recently filed to legally change his name to just Ye, had his third stadium listening party for his evolving album on Thursday night. He has come under fire for the choice of guests for the event - especially Marilyn Manson and DaBaby. Manson turned himself in to authorities last month on assault charges, while DaBaby was in the news for his homophobic comments.
After two similar events at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, West gathered about 40,000 fans inside Chicago’s Soldier Field. In the center of the field, West built a replica of his childhood home topped by a cross where he and the guest stars appeared on the porch. The group reportedly included Travis Scott, Marilyn Manson, Shenseea, Westside Gunn, DaBaby, Don Toliver, Larry Hoover Jr. and Rooga.
Manson is battling a cascade of recent sexual assault and abuse accusations from women, including ex girlfriends and an assistant, reported Deadline. DaBaby, for his part, made homophobic comments onstage at a Miami event last month. A number of the rapper’s subsequent performances were canceled, including one at Lollapolooza.
The event also baffled fans for including an appearance from West’s estranged wife Kim Kardashian, who emerged in a wedding dress at the listening party – six months after filing for divorce. After previously supporting her ex from the stands at the last two listening parties, Kim played a starring role in the event at Soldier Field in Chicago, as she walked out in the stadium in a couture wedding gown.
As the final song of the night, No Child Left Behind, played, Kim walked out into the middle of the arena in a stunning Balenciaga Couture dress and veil, to join Kanye, 44, who was dressed all in black leather.

Kanye West brings estranged wife Kim Kardashian on stage in wedding dress at latest Donda event,"Kim Kardashian West has appeared on stage with Kanye West at yet another listening party for his-yet-to-be-released album Donda.
It is the third such event West, who has filed to be legally known as Ye in recent days, has held, with the latest taking place in his home city of Chicago.
Donda, named after his late mother, was originally due to be released last summer, but West's perfectionist tendencies has meant he has delayed its launch several times.
Not one for doing things by half, West brought out his estranged wife during the event while she was draped in a Balenciaga wedding dress during the track No Child Left Behind - months after she filed for divorce for the rapper.
Kardashian West has been present at all of West's events in recent months, setting alight rumours that they could be getting back together.

Other guests on stage at the 40,000-seater Soldier Field stadium included controversial artists DaBaby and Marilyn Manson.
DaBaby has been widely condemned for comments he made about gay men and HIV-positive people at a festival in Miami recently, while Manson is facing a number of sexual assault allegations - which he denies.
The trio stood on the porch on the set which depicted West's childhood home, while an army of backing dancers and a convoy of SUVs surrounded them.
Elsewhere, The Weeknd and Travis Scott both appeared on the album, while a sample from Lauryn Hill could be heard in one of the tracks.
At one point, West even appeared to set himself on fire inside the stadium.

"Kanye West Joined By Marilyn Manson, DaBaby At ‘Donda’ Listening Party","Kanye West – who recently filed to legally change his name to just Ye – had his third stadium listening party for his evolving album, Donda, on Thursday night.
After two similar events at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, West gathered about 40,000 fans inside Chicago’s Soldier Field, according to a local NBC report.
In the center of the field, West built a replica of his childhood home topped by a cross where he and a secession of guest stars appeared on the porch. The group reportedly included Travis Scott, Marilyn Manson, Shenseea, Westside Gunn, DaBaby, Don Toliver, Larry Hoover Jr. and Rooga.

Manson and DaBaby are controversial choices.
Manson, as Deadline has reported, turned himself in to authorities last month on assault charges. That follows a cascade of recent sexual assault and abuse accusations from women, including ex girlfriends and an assistant.
Watch on Deadline
DaBaby, for his part, made homophobic comments onstage at a Miami event last month. A number of the rapper’s subsequent performances were canceled, including one at Lollapolooza.

So the appearance of the duo with a recently redevoted Christian such as West under a cross at an event for an album dedicated to his late mother in the city where she raised him seems, at the very least, incongruous. It was not the only moment of spectacle.
The event, which seemed even more elaborate than the Atlanta gatherings, was live streamed by Apple Music. It included a faceless group decked out in black tactical gear with his mother’s name on their flak jackets.

There was a spectral woman in white who looked ready for a ghostly wedding as she plodded up to a smiling West.
There was a video of a figure that appeared to be the rapper sitting, on fire, in a flaming house.
There was West standing in front of the house surrounded by what seemed a ring of fire.
Donda the album has evolved from listening event to listening event. Many tonight were speculating that the Chicago version is the final iteration.

It was hoped that it would be a case of third-time lucky for Kanye West as he held another album listening party for Donda.
However, the 44-year-old rapper appears to have caused outrage among his fans after they spotted that Jay-Z's appearance on a song had been cut.
Instead, rapper DaBaby has seemingly got the nod to perform alongside the Gold Digger singer.
Fans got to hear the latest version of Kanye's song, titled Jail, during the star's third listening party in Chicago for his new album on Thursday.
But the decision to include DaBaby has been met with outrage by Kanye's patient fans who flocked to Twitter to share their disgust at the decision.

One fan wrote: ""Kanye replacing jay z with da baby is the biggest L of the century holy s**t #DONDA""
Another fumed: ""Kanye Better stop messing with us and bring back Jay Z on the track #DONDA""
""Why did kanye take off jay z’s first and add DABABY out of all people ????,"" asked a third.
And a fourth said: ""Tell me its a lie that Kanye took Jay Z off… SAY IT AIN’T SO. #DONDA""
Fans on social media had originally been sent into a frenzy during Kanye's original listening party when fans were treated to the song featuring Jay-Z.
It appeared as though the pair had buried the hatchet after years of tension. And dans couldn't get enough of the revelation as they flooded Twitter with their excitement - many were calling for another Watch the Throne album 10 years after the pair collaborated for the first.
One fan at the time wrote: ""Y’all don’t understand 10 years has passed since we heard jayz and Kanye on a track together ! #DONDA #dondalisteningparty this is a moment in music history right here""
But the excitement now appears to have been short-lived, although anything is possible when it comes to Kanye - fans were shocked even further as Marilyn Manson joined the singer on stage.

He was supported at the latest album party once again by estranged wife Kim Kardashian and their kids.
The reality star, 40, filed for divorce in February but has been a keen supporter of her former man's latest music.
The pair have been working successfully as co-parents and reports suggest that Kim is set to keep the singer's surname for the sake of the kids.
Kanye on the other hand is reported to have filed to have his name legally changed to Ye.

"Kanye West Replaces Jay-Z With DaBaby, Brings Out Marilyn Manson","It is about that time. Chicago is at the center of attention for Hip Hop fans as Kanye West has unveiled his third, and suspected final, listening event in his hometown. Thus far, West has taken over a Las Vegas church for a Donda listening session as well as camped out at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta for his two events that hosted tens of thousands of attendees. This time around, the rapper erected a replica of his childhood home fitted with a large, lit cross at its top, and fans were eating it up ahead of Donda's arrival.
The rollout of this anticipated record has existed for some time but only in recent months has Donda's release been confirmed. After release dates have turned Kanye into ""the boy who cried wolf,"" the public has all but given up on believing that Donda will actually hit streaming platforms. However, Ye's team promises that it will, for certain, make an appearance at the top of Friday (August 27) morning.
While it is expected that we will share much more from this event throughout the weekend, we've collected a few images, videos, and firsthand experiences from people who attended to Chicago listening event in Soldier Field. West has reportedly already brought in millions of dollars from his Donda efforts in recent months, proving that he knows how to capitalize off of a music-making moment.
Fans noted that Jay-Z was replaced with DaBaby, a controversial move considering the North Carolina artist's recent scandal, but Marilyn Manson's appearance also ruffled feathers. The shock-rocker currently faces several rape and sexual assault allegations and lawsuits.

Marilyn Manson to Appear on Kanye West 'Donda' Album,"After disgraced shock rocker Marilyn Manson appeared at Kanye West's Chicago Donda listening event on Thursday night (Aug. 26) at Chicago's Soldier Field, Billboard has confirmed that the singer's voice will appear on the as-yet-unscheduled album as well.
""Marilyn Manson's voice is featured on DONDA, and he will continue to conceptually collaborate with Ye on the DONDA project,"" a spokesperson for the rocker told Billboard. Newsweek was first to break the news.
At press time, West's team had not responded to requests for further details of the unexpected collab on the album, whose release date and feature lineup have been moving targets. 'Ye invited Manson (born Brian Hugh Warner) to the show in the midst of the shock rocker's current legal issues, which include lawsuits from four women over accusations of rape and sexual, physical and emotional assault, as well as claims from a number of other women regarding alleged inappropriate, threatening and abusive sexual behavior.",2021-08-27T04:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

The three horsemen of the apocalypse?
Kanye West brought rapper Da Baby and rocker Marilyn Manson on stage during his Chicago listening party for his new highly anticipated album ""Donda"" on Thursday night.
Manson, Da Baby, and Kanye posed at Chicago's Soldier Field on a set modeled after West's childhood home.
Both Manson and Da Baby are controversial picks, to say the least. Manson has been accused by multiple women — including his ex-fiancé, actor Rachel Evan Wood — of abuse.
Manson is facing multiple lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault, including one from his ex-girlfriend, ""Game of Thrones"" star Esmé Bianco, who in a lawsuit claims Manson, real name Brian Warner, spanked, bit, cut, and whipped ""Ms. Bianco's buttocks, breasts, and genitals for Mr. Warner's sexual gratification"" without Bianco's consent. Manson has denied the allegations.
Da Baby came under fire earlier this summer for making homophobic comments and collaborating with alleged abuser Tory Lanez.
""If you didn't show up today with HIV, AIDS, or any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases that'll make you die in two to three weeks, then put your cell phone lighter up,"" he said during an appearance at the Rolling Loud festival in Miami. ""Fellas, if you ain't sucking d--- in the parking lot, put your cell phone lighter up.""
The comments ignited a firestorm of backlash from LGBTQ people and allies.
HIV-positive ""Queer Eye"" star Jonathan Van Ness condemned DaBaby's comments on Twitter.
""This stigma of HIV/AIDS is what is killing folks & it's spread by this kind of misinformation that then people go believe,"" Van Ness wrote.
Dua Lipa, one of Da Baby's past collaborators, condemned the comments. He was dropped from the Lollapalooza festival and lost an endorsement deal with Boohoo Man as a result.
Da Baby later apologized for the comments.
Fans were perplexed and troubled by West's choice to bring the two stars on stage.

Kanye West Brings Marilyn Manson Out at Chicago Donda Livestream Event,"Kanye West hosted the third livestreamed listening party for his new album Donda. While the last two took place in Atlanta, the new one broadcast live from his hometown of Chicago, where he set up a replica of his childhood Chicago home inside Soldier Field. The broadcast was streamed on Apple Music. (Pitchfork earns a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)
The house was surrounded by vehicles and candles, while a big screen shared Bible verses. West appeared on the stoop alongside Marilyn Manson, who is currently facing multiple lawsuits for sexual assault. Additionally, a spokesperson for Manson told People that the musician’s “voice is featured on Donda,” and that “he will continue to conceptually collaborate with Ye on the Donda project.” A new feature from DaBaby appeared to take the place of a previously shared JAY-Z verse, too. Multiple new songs were added to the album for its third public debut. COVID-19 vaccinations and tests were reportedly not required for the limited capacity event.

West’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian West attended the event again with the couple’s children. During the performance, West and Kardashian West also recreated their wedding, as TMZ notes and Apple Music captured below. Also during the event, West appeared to set himself on fire, which Apple Music also captured in the below GIF.
Kanye West has been teasing Donda since last year. In July 2020, he shared a song snippet titled “Donda” that featured a sample of West’s late mother Donda reciting lyrics from KRS-One’s “Sound of da Police.” Later that month, he tweeted and deleted a 20-song tracklist, later sharing an updated, 12-track roster from his next album, called Donda.
The rapper revived hype around the album just last month, when he announced the first Donda listening party, which took place at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on July 22. West premiered Donda at the event, which was scheduled for release the following day. It never appeared.
West later pushed the album release date to August 6 and announced a second Donda listening party, which took place, once again, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Ahead of the second event, Apple streamed West’s living quarters within the arena where was allegedly “finishing” the album. Ahead of the third event, West started selling a device called the Donda Stem Player.

Kanye West onder vuur om podium voor Marilyn Manson,"Kanye verving Jay-Z in een van de nummers door DaBaby. Die kwam onlangs nog in opspraak door homofobe en kwetsende uitspraken die hij deed tijdens een van zijn optredens. Ook de aanwezigheid van Marilyn Manson kreeg kritiek.

Ook het slot van de luistersessie zorgde bij fans voor gefronste wenkbrauwen. Kanye stak zichzelf, gehuld in een vuurvast pak, in brand. Even later werd hij door crewleden met brandblussers geholpen. Kort daarna verscheen volgens entertainmentwebsite TMZ zijn ex-vrouw Kim Kardashian in een trouwjurk op het podium.
Het duurt nog even voordat Donda ook echt wordt uitgebracht, terwijl Kanyes manager Bu Thiam eerder nog beloofde dat het album na de luistersessie zou uitkomen. Volgens Apple Music komt Donda nu op 3 september uit. Het is al de derde keer dat de release is uitgesteld.

Criminal complaint case filed against Marilyn Manson for misdemeanour at 2019 concert in New Hampshire,"Marilyn Manson approached a videographer during the concert and allegedly spit and blew snot at her, said a police affidavit.
Rocker Marilyn Manson approached a videographer at his 2019 concert in New Hampshire and allegedly spit and blew snot on her, according to a police affidavit released Wednesday.
Manson, whose legal name is Brian Hugh Warner, surrendered last month to police in Los Angeles in connection with a 2019 arrest warrant in the case. The allegations were detailed in the affidavit that released along with the criminal complaint in the case.
Manson is charged with two misdemeanour counts of simple assault stemming from an alleged incident on 19 August, 2019, at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford. The misdemeanour charges can each result in a jail sentence of less than a year and a $2,000 fine if convicted.
An arraignment hearing on the charges will be scheduled for 2 September at Laconia District Court in New Hampshire.
Manson’s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
Susan Fountain, a videographer, was in the venue’s stage pit area at the time of the alleged assault. Her company, Metronome Media, was contracted by the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion for the concert season.
According to the affidavit, Manson approached Fountain the first time, put his face close to the camera and spit a “big lougee” at her. She was struck on both hands with saliva.
Manson allegedly returned a second time, covering one side of his nostril and blowing in Fountain’s direction. Fountain put down her camera and went to the restroom to wash her hands and arms that had Manson’s bodily fluids on them.
Manson also has faced abuse accusations — unrelated to the New Hampshire incident — in recent years. He has denied wrongdoing.
In February, actor Evan Rachel Wood publicly accused Manson, her ex-fiance, of sexual and other physical abuse, alleging she was “manipulated into submission” during their relationship. Months later, Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco sued Manson in federal court in Los Angeles, alleging sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Bianco and Wood have spoken publicly.
In 2018, Los Angeles County prosecutors declined to file charges against Manson over allegations of assault, battery and sexual assault dating to 2011, saying they were limited by statutes of limitations and a lack of corroboration. The accuser, in that case, was identified only as a social acquaintance of Manson.",2021-08-19T09:28:24Z,https://www.firstpost.com,Firstpost

Manson, whose legal name is Brian Hugh Warner, surrendered last month to police in Los Angeles in connection with a 2019 arrest warrant in the case. The allegations were detailed in the affidavit that released along with the criminal complaint in the case.

Manson is charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from an alleged incident on Aug. 19, 2019, at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford. The misdemeanor charges can each result in a jail sentence of less than a year and a $2,000 fine if convicted.
An arraignment hearing on the charges will be scheduled for Sept. 2 at Laconia District Court in New Hampshire.
Manson’s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.
Susan Fountain, a videographer, was in the venue’s stage pit area at the time of the alleged assault. Her company, Metronome Media, was contracted by the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion for the concert season.
According to the affidavit, Manson approached Fountain the first time, put his face close to the camera and spit a “big lougee” at her. She was struck on both hands with saliva.
Manson allegedly returned a second time, covering one side of his nostril and blowing in Fountain's direction. Fountain put down her camera and went to the restroom to wash her hands and arms that had Manson's bodily fluids on them.
Manson also has faced abuse accusations — unrelated to the New Hampshire incident — in recent years. He has denied wrongdoing.
In February, actor Evan Rachel Wood publicly accused Manson, her ex-fiance, of sexual and other physical abuse, alleging she was “manipulated into submission” during their relationship. Months later, “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco sued Manson in federal court in Los Angeles, alleging sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
The AP generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Bianco and Wood have spoken publicly.
In 2018, Los Angeles County prosecutors declined to file charges against Manson over allegations of assault, battery and sexual assault dating to 2011, saying they were limited by statutes of limitations and a lack of corroboration. The accuser in that case was identified only as a social acquaintance of Manson.",2021-08-18T12:34:53Z,https://www.nbcboston.com,NBC10 Boston
Love Island sparks outrage with ‘distasteful’ Marilyn Manson music choice as he faces sex assault allegations,"LOVE Island has sparked outrage amongst fans after they opened the show with a Marilyn Manson song.
The music choice - his version of Tainted Love - is somewhat controversial as the musician has been accused of sexual assault, which he vehemently denies.

Game Of Thrones star Esme Bianco claimed he electrocuted and cut her in a horror rape in court documents.
According to the lawsuit, the 52-year-old hitmaker also engaged in human trafficking when he ""employed fraud"" in bringing British actress Bianco to the US to appear in a music video for his song, I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies.
His lawyers said the claims were a contrived ""plot"" to gain cash and discredit him.
Esme was one of the many women who spoke out against the musician.
His ex Evan Rachel Wood, 33, publicly named him on Instagram and said he began ""grooming"" her when she was a teenager and ""horrifically abused me for years"".
Manson has described the allegations as ""horrible distortions of reality"".
Those watching last night’s Love Island clocked the song choice and took to Twitter to discuss it.

A Timeline of Abuse Allegations Against Marilyn Manson,"Billboard made earlier attempts to reach Manson for comment through his now former management, but has not received any responses.
Following Wood's statement, a number of other women went public with their own claims against Manson, but his history with abuse allegations stems back nearly 25 years. See below for a full timeline. February 1998 - The Long Hard Road Out of Hell Manson's autobiography featured a number of anecdotes, which Chicago Reader critic Jim Derogatis called out at the time for “generally mistreating one or more women per page.” In a particularly gruesome chapter, “Meating the Fans / Meat and Greet,” Manson recalled a deaf fan who got covered in raw meat and had sex with a number of band members before getting urinated on by Manson and his bandmate. While that encounter was presented as consensual by Manson, another anecdote featuring Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor stirred controversy. The chapter, which resurfaced online recently, details how Reznor and Manson allegedly physically and sexually assaulted an intoxicated woman in the '90s. On Feb. 3, 2021, Reznor issued a statement to denounce his onetime collaborator. ""I have been vocal over the years about my dislike of Manson as a person and cut ties with him nearly 25 years ago,"" Reznor said in his statement to Pitchfork. ""As I said at the time, the passage from Manson’s memoir is a complete fabrication. I was infuriated and offended back when it came out and remain so today."" December 2001 - Assault and sexual misconduct charge Manson was charged with assaulting security guard Joshua Keasler after he allegedly spit on the man's head and rubbed his G-string-clad genital area on it during a concert at the DTE Energy Music Theatre in Clarkston, Michigan. He was accused of felony fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct along with misdemeanor assault and battery. Manson pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct and received a $4,000 fine. He and the security guard eventually reached a settlement. April 2002 - Wrongful death lawsuit Following the death of actress Jennifer Syme, her mother Maria St. John sued Manson for wrongful death, alleging that he gave her drugs and encouraged her to drive while inebriated. On his website, Manson shared a statement, calling the accusations ""completely false."" ""Manson believes that the lawsuit is completely unfounded and is investigating an immediate counter-suit against St. John for slander, harassment and abuse of the legal process,"" the statement read, according to Blabbermouth. ""'This lawsuit, which is completely without merit, will not bring back Jennifer's life. It serves only to reopen the wounds and the pain felt by all who loved Jennifer. It is a pity that St. John sullies her own daughter's reputation by filing this baseless claim.'"" “After Manson and his five guests finished an evening at the movies followed by a quiet get-together at his home, he made sure Syme received a safe ride home from a designated driver and went to sleep,"" the statement concluded. June 2009 - Spin interview Following his first breakup from Wood in 2007, Manson revealed to Spin in an extensive Q&A that he severely self-harmed following their split. He also shared violent thoughts about the then-22-year-old Wood, and how his song ""I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies"" is about the ""fantasies"" he had ""every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer."" In November 2020, after Manson was asked about Wood's domestic abuse testimonies in an interview with Metal Hammer, the singer hung up the phone. Manson's team later released a statement claiming the ""sledgehammer"" comment was ""obviously a theatrical rock star interview promoting a new record, and not a factual account. The fact that Evan and Manson got engaged six months after this interview would indicate that no one took this story literally."" July 2009 - Violent threats against music journalists In response to media scrutiny, Manson reportedly threatened music journalists in a since-deleted blog post. “I am far different than the soon-to-be-murdered-in-their-home press has decided to fabricate,” he wrote, according to The Guardian. “If one more ‘journalist’ makes a cavalier statement about me and my band, I will personally or with my fans’ help, greet them at their home and discover just how much they believe in their freedom of speech.” October 2017 - Twiggy Ramirez allegations Ramirez, Manson's longtime bassist, was accused by Jack Off Jill singer Jessicka Addams of sexual and psychological abuse while they dated in the 1990s. Following the allegations, Ramirez (real name Jeordie White) was removed from Manson's touring party. Manson said in a statement announcing the exit that he “knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka’s obvious distress.” In a statement to Pitchfork, Ramirez said that he had “only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago,” and claimed, “I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind.”
February 2018 - Charlyne Yi's allegations The House actress said in a since-deleted tweet that Manson was a ""huge fan of the show,"" and visited the cast while they were filming the final season, where he ""harassed just about every woman asking us if we were going to scissor, rhino & called me a China man."" ""I genuinely hope he gets help,"" she continued. February 2018 - Wood testifies before Congress In an effort to secure a bill of rights for sexual assault survivors in all 50 states, Wood detailed her personal experience, without naming names. “My experience with domestic violence was this,"" she said, ""the toxic mental, physical and sexual abuse which started slow but escalated over time, including threats against my life, severe gaslighting and brainwashing, waking up to the man that claimed to love me, raping what he believed to be my unconscious body.” August 2018 - Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office declines to pursue a case against Manson Manson had a police report filed against him at the height of the #MeToo movement for unspecified sex crimes dating back to 2011. The district attorney declined the case because the statute of limitations had expired and ""absence of corroboration,"" according to the court filing. ""Under current policy, the Los Angeles County District Attorney must investigate any claim of sexual abuse, no matter how outlandish. It is not surprising that the District Attorney, after investigation, summarily rejected the claims made in a police report filed by a former acquaintance against Brian Warner p/k/a Marilyn Manson,"" the singer's attorney, Howard E. King, Esq., said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter at the time. ""The allegations made to the police were and are categorically denied by Mr. Warner and are either completely delusional or part of a calculated attempt to generate publicity for the claimant’s business of selling Manson memorabilia. The police report that spurred the investigation was accompanied by the woman’s press release and other attempts to generate publicity that fraudulently claimed she was held captive by Mr. Warner for 48 hours in 2011. Any claim of sexual impropriety or imprisonment at that, or any other, time is false."" April 2019 - Wood testifies before a California State panel Wood once more declined to name her abuser while detailing her experience with domestic violence. “The fear of being judged by society is debilitating and the fear of retaliation from my abuser is paralyzing,” she said. “I have been diagnosed with complex PTSD, including disassociation, panic attacks, night terrors, agoraphobia, impulse control, chronic pain in my body, among other symptoms.” February 2021 - Wood names Manson as her abuser On Feb. 1, 2021, Wood took to Instagram to share a statement. ""The name of my abuser is Brian Warner, also known to the world as Marilyn Manson,"" she wrote. ""He started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years. I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission. I am done living in fear of retaliation, slander or blackmail."" She continued, ""I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives. I stand with the many victims who will no longer be silent."" Following her post, four other women came forward with similarly horrifying allegations against Manson, with their accounts shared by Vanity Fair. February 2021 - Manson calls Wood's claims ""horrible distortions of reality"" The musician took to Instagram to deny the abuse claims. ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,"" he wrote. ""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth."" February 2021 - Manson dropped by Loma Vista Recordings label, CAA and longtime manager Tony Ciulla ""In light of today’s disturbing allegations by Evan Rachel Wood and other women naming Marilyn Manson as their abuser, Loma Vista will cease to further promote his current album, effective immediately. Due to these concerning developments, we have also decided not to work with Marilyn Manson on any future projects,"" the record label said in a statement. Manson was also edited out of an episode of the Starz series American Gods, on which he has had a recurring role, while AMC’s Shudder service confirmed it will not be airing a segment of a forthcoming episode of its Creepshow TV series in which Manson appears. Ciulla did not responded to Billboard’s request for comment. February 2021 - Pheobe Bridgers voices support for the victims The singer issued a trigger warning on Twitter before delving into her experience at his house when she was a teenager. ""I went to Marilyn Manson’s house when I was a teenager with some friends. I was a big fan,"" she tweeted. ""He referred to a room in his house as the 'r*pe room', I thought it was just his horrible frat boy sense of humor. I stopped being a fan. I stand with everyone who came forward."" She also alleged that ""the label knew, management knew, the band knew"" in a secondary tweet, though she didn't specify names or exactly what they were aware of. ""Distancing themselves now, pretending to be shocked and horrified is f---ing pathetic,"" she wrote.
February 2021 - Wood shares more harrowing details The actress wrote in an Instagram Story that she had to file a police report last year after becoming aware of a threat about the release of underage photos of herself. ""On Dec. 19, I had to file a police report after I was alerted to threats made by @leslee_lane and @lindsayusichofficial (Brian's wife) for conspiring to release photos of me when I was UNDERAGE, after being given large amounts of drugs and alcohol, after Brian performed on Halloween in Las Vegas to 'ruin my career' and 'shut me up,'"" wrote the Westworld star. She included a copy of the police report, with contact and personal information blacked out. She also resurfaced a post which provided more details of what she experienced with Manson. ""I was called a jew in a derogatory manner,"" wrote Wood. ""He would draw swastikas over my bedside table when he was mad at me. I heard the 'n' word over and over."" She continued, ""Everyone around him was expected to laugh and join in. If you did not or (god forbid) called him out, you were singled out and abused more. I have never been more scared in my life."" February 2021 - Wolf Alice's Ellie Rowsell shares her experience ""Solidarity to Evan Rachel Wood and those calling out Marilyn Manson,"" Rowsell tweeted. ""It's sad to see people defending him, just because he put his depravity in plain sight doesn't give him a free pass to abuse women?!"" ""I met Marilyn backstage at a festival a few years ago,"" she continued. ""After his compliments towards my band became more and more hyperbolic I became suspicious of his behaviour. I was shocked to look down and see he was filming up my skirt with a gopro."" ""There were no repercussions for his behaviour,"" she wrote, adding that a member of his tour staff said, ""'he does this kind of thing all the time.'""",2021-07-30T04:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Marilyn Manson vill att sexbrott ska ogillas,"Esmé Bianco lämnade i april in en stämningsansökan mot Manson, som egentligen heter Brian Warner. I den hävdade hon att rocksångaren under deras förhållande 2011 ska ha använt sig av droger, våld och hot om våld för att tilltvinga sig sex. Han ska också ha piskat, bitit och skurit henne.
Mansons advokater lämnade på onsdagen in en skrivelse till rätten i ett försök att få fallet gällande Bianco ogiltigförklarat.
”Utan ett uns av bevis till stöd för deras anklagelser, försöker målsägaren och hennes medkonspiratörer desperat att smälta samman bilden och artisteriet av Warners chockrock-scenpersona Marilyn Manson med fabricerade historier om övergrepp”, står det i rättsdokumentet.
De hävdar också att anklagelserna om övergrepp mot Bianco faller utanför den då gällande preskriptionstiden. Enligt skrivelsen ”löpte de ut under den tidigare gällande preskriptionstiden” och inte under den nuvarande lagen ”Phoenix Act”, som både Bianco och skådespelaren Evan Rachel Wood hjälpte till att få till stånd. Skrivelsen hävdar därmed att den nya förlängda preskriptionstiden inte gäller för Mansons påstådda övergrepp mot Bianco.
Tidigare har även skådespelaren Evan Rachel Wood anklagat Marilyn Manson för misshandel och grooming, som enligt henne ska ha skett när de var ett par.

Love Island viewers have called out the show's producers after Thursday's episode opened with Marilyn Manson's version of 'Tainted Love'.
It is not the first time that there has been a controversial soundtrack used during this series and fans of the show were quick to point out the inappropriate connotations of the rock singer's version of the Northern Soul standard.
Marilyn Manson, whose real name in Brian Warner, has been fighting sex assault claims made by Game of Thrones actress Esme Bianco earlier this year.
Manson has filed to dismiss the case, saying he denies ""each and every"" allegation and that the claims against him are ""untrue, meritless"" and part of a ""coordinated attack"" by multiple women.

Viewers were quick to point out on Twitter that despite this, the song was an inappropriate choice which could have been easily avoided.
One fan tweeted: ""Starting the episode on Marilyn Manson. Controversial. #LoveIsland""
While another asked on the social media platform: ""Why were they playing the Marilyn Manson version of Tainted Love? #LoveIsland""
A third tweeted: ""Playing Marilyn Manson at the start, clearly didn’t get the memo #loveisland""
A fourth added: ""Bit distasteful playing Marilyn Manson… especially on a show about love #LoveIsland #LoveIslandUK""
With the boys in Casa Amor and seemingly quickly forgetting any relationship they had in the villa as they get to know the new girls intimately, another viewer pointed out: ""Marylin Manson on #LoveIsland is this because Bryan is as awful as the guys on there?""

This followed Love Island viewers criticising the show for its use of the song ’N***** in Paris’ in an episode after bombshell arrival Danny Bibby had apologised for having used the n-word on social media back in 2019 when replying to a comment by a white friend.
Danny had said from the Love Island villa: ""I'd like to take the time to apologise to anyone that may have taken offence to my inappropriate remark.""
The instalment opened the episode with an excerpt from the song by Kanye West and Jay-Z but with some lyrics, including explicit content, edited out, with the backing primarily being heard.

Marilyn Manson wants Esmé Bianco's sex assault suit dismissed,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)
Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)
Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)
Marilyn Manson requested that a judge throw out Esmé Bianco’s sexual assault lawsuit against him.
Manson — born Brian Hugh Warner — called Bianco’s claims “untrue” and “meritless” and suggested they are “a key component of a coordinated attack” by women who want to “dishonestly seek to monetize and exploit the #MeToo movement,” per federal court documents obtained by Page Six Thursday.
The singer, 52, alleged that the “Game of Thrones” alum, 39, and other unnamed women “spent months plotting, workshopping and fine-tuning their stories to turn what were consensual friendships and relationships with [him] from more than a decade ago into twisted tales that bear no resemblance to reality.”
He then claimed that they are “desperately trying to conflate the imagery and artistry of [his] ‘shock rock’ stage persona, Marilyn Manson, with fabricated accounts of abuse.”
Manson argued that even if Bianco’s allegations were true, she is not within the seven-year statute of limitations from when the alleged incident took place.
Bianco’s attorney did not immediately respond to Page Six’s request for comment on Manson’s latest claims.
The actress filed the lawsuit on April 30, accusing the Grammy nominee of drugging, torturing and sexually assaulting her between 2009 and 2011.
His attorney called the accusations “provably false” in May.
Just weeks later, Manson’s former assistant Ashley Walters sued him for sexual assault, battery and harassment.
More recently, the metal star surrendered himself to police earlier this month over an alleged “snot rocket” assault in 2019. He turned himself in for an assault on a videographer in June as well.
In response to the many allegations against him, Manson was dropped by his record label, talent agency and manager in addition to being removed from episodes of “American Gods” and “Creepshow.”",2021-07-29T14:52:40Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
Marilyn Manson quer arquivar o caso de agressão sexual relacionado com Esmé Bianco,"A actriz britânica Esmé Bianco acusou o músico de agressões, inclusive sexuais. Mas, como os actos remontam a 2011, a defesa considera que, segundo a lei no estado da Califórnia, já prescreveram.
As várias denúncias sobre alegados abusos e agressões sexuais por Marilyn Manson deram origem a alguns processos contra o músico, apresentados pela actriz Esmé Bianco, pela antiga assistente pessoal, Ashley Walters, pela modelo Ashley Morgan Smithline e por uma quarta mulher que optou por permanecer anónima. Agora, os advogados de Manson apresentaram um requerimento para que o processo seja arquivado, argumentando que as alegações das quatro mulheres são “falsas” e fazem parte de um “ataque coordenado” de múltiplas mulheres.
No leque de 12 mulheres que denunciaram Brian Warner, o nome verdadeiro de Manson, esteve a sua ex-noiva Evan Rachel Wood. A actriz norte-americana, conhecida, em particular, pela participação na série Westworld, disse ter sido submetida a “abusos horríveis durante anos”, confirmando o nome do agressor a que se referiu quando criou o movimento #IAmNotOk​.
Mais mulheres se seguiram, uma das quais Esmé Bianco (a Ros da série Guerra dos Tronos), que interpôs uma acção contra Manson, alegando que o músico a amarrou, lhe bateu e electrocutou-a, coagindo-a a ter relações sexuais que eram violentas e degradantes — por vezes, quando estava inconsciente ou incapaz de consentir de outra forma.
Só que as acusações de Bianco remontam a actos ocorridos em 2011 e, segundo a lei no estado da Califórnia, prescreveram sete anos depois, o que levou a defesa a pedir que o processo seja arquivado.
Nos papéis apresentados a um tribunal de Los Angeles, citados pela BBC, os advogados de Manson afirmam ainda que “não há um fragmento de prova” para apoiar as alegações, acusando as queixosas de “tentarem desesperadamente confundir o imaginário e a arte da persona do palco (…) com relatos forjados de abusos”. Além disso, a argumentação considera que as mulheres que o acusam estão “a procurar rentabilizar e explorar o movimento #MeToo”.
Na sequência das acusações contra Manson em Fevereiro, a editora discográfica com que trabalhava cortou relações.
Manson, de 52 anos, ficou conhecido pela criação de uma personagem de inspiração gótica. O nome do artista é uma junção do nome próprio da icónica actriz norte-americana Marilyn Monroe com o apelido do homicida Charles Manson, responsável pela morte da actriz Sharon Tate, na época grávida e casada com o realizador de cinema Roman Polanski​.
Os concertos de Manson são conhecidos pela mescla de elementos góticos e satânicos com música de inspiração metal. Dois dos álbuns do artista chegaram a ser os mais vendidos na altura nos EUA. Algumas das mulheres que dizem que foram violadas pelo artista revelaram que eram antigas groupies e retrataram uma personagem sedutora, manipuladora, que as amarrava, ameaçava e obrigava ao consumo de drogas.
“Estou cansada de viver com medo de represálias, de calúnias e de chantagem”, escreve Evan Rachel Wood. Em 2009, em entrevista à revista Spin, Manson disse que tinha “todos os dias a fantasia de pulverizar” o crânio da actriz “com um martelo”.",2021-07-29T14:43:23Z,https://www.publico.pt,PÚBLICO
"Verdrehte Geschichten?: Manson wittert ""koordinierten Angriff""","Gleich mehrere Frauen werfen Marilyn Manson vor, sie sexuell missbraucht und gedemütigt zu haben. Der Sänger weist sämtliche Anschuldigungen von Anfang an zurück. Nun geht er offenbar in die Gegenoffensive und unterstellt den Klägerinnen eine lang geplante Kampagne gegen ihn.
Marilyn Manson wehrt sich weiter gegen die gegen ihn erhobenen Missbrauchsvorwürfe. Anfang des Jahres war der Musiker unter anderem von ""Game of Thrones""-Star Esmé Bianco verklagt worden. Sie wirft ihm sexuelle Übergriffe und Missbrauch vor. Kurz darauf hatte bereits Mansons Anwalt erklärt, die Vorwürfe seien ""nachweislich falsch"".
""Fox News"" berichtet nun unter Berufung auf neue Gerichtsunterlagen, Manson bestreite alle gegen ihn erhobene Anschuldigungen. Biancos Behauptungen seien ""unwahr, unbegründet und eine Schlüsselkomponente eines koordinierten Angriffs mehrerer Klägerinnen, die zynisch und unehrlich versuchen, die #MeToo-Bewegung zu monetarisieren und auszunutzen"", heißt es demnach in den Dokumenten.
""Gehirnwäsche"" und ""Manipulation""
Manson wurde in den vergangenen Monaten von mehreren Frauen beschuldigt, sexuelle Übergriffe begangen zu haben. Neben Bianco hat ihn unter anderem auch seine ehemalige Assistentin verklagt. Diese Personen hätten Monate damit verbracht, ""ihre Geschichten zu planen, zu erarbeiten und zu verfeinern, um die einvernehmlichen Freundschaften und Beziehungen"" mit Manson ""in verdrehte Geschichten zu verwandeln, die keine Ähnlichkeit mit der Realität haben"", heißt es laut ""Fox News"" in den Dokumenten weiter. Es gebe nicht den Hauch eines Beweises für die Anschuldigungen. Zudem wird auf die Verjährungsfrist hingewiesen.
Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte im Februar dieses Jahres ""Westworld""-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood, die mehrere Jahre mit Manson liiert gewesen war. Wood hatte auf Instagram behauptet, Manson habe sie ""jahrelang schrecklich missbraucht"". Sie sei ""einer Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und durch Manipulation zur Unterwerfung gebracht"" worden.
""Schreckliche Verzerrungen""
Ende April war bekannt geworden, dass die britische Schauspielerin Esmé Bianco Klage gegen den Musiker eingereicht hat. Die 39-Jährige behauptet in den Gerichtsunterlagen, dass Manson sie mehrfach zum Geschlechtsverkehr gezwungen habe. Sie wirft ihm zudem vor, sie unter Drogen gesetzt und bedroht zu haben.
Manson hat von Beginn an alle Vorwürfe von sich gewiesen. In einem Statement teilte er mit: ""Offensichtlich waren mein Leben und meine Kunst lange Zeit Magneten für Kontroversen, aber diese jüngsten Behauptungen über mich sind schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität.""

Esmé Bianco and Marilyn Manson: The 'Game of Thrones' Star's Allegations Explained,"Actress Esmé Bianco has accused shock rocker Marilyn Manson, her former boyfriend, of sexual battery, sexual assault and breaches of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.
Read more Marilyn Manson Has Made No Effort to Answer Arrest Warrant, Police Say Marilyn Manson Has Made No Effort to Answer Arrest Warrant, Police Say
On Wednesday, attorneys for Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, called for the lawsuit to be thrown out because the statute of limitations had run its course.
Bianco, best known for her role as Ros in Game of Thrones, has stated that some of these events took place in 2009 and 2011, which Manson's lawyers say is outside the statute of limitations for these kinds of crimes in California.
The motion filed by Manson's legal team, which has been seen by Insider, states that Bianco is ""cynically and dishonestly seeking to monetize and exploit the #MeToo movement"" with her claims.
What Esmé Bianco Alleges About Marilyn Manson
Bianco's lawsuit—which was filed in April and also names Manson's former manager, Tony Ciulla, and Ciulla's management company—states that she had met Manson in 2005, when he married to Dita Von Teese.
According to the lawsuit, Manson suggested film project ideas to Bianco while he was married and then, after his divorce in 2007, made ""sexual overtures"" to her, requesting nude photographs.
The court documents allege that he continued to suggest film projects they could work on that did not materialize—until, in 2009, he flew the British-born actress to Los Angeles to work on the video for his song ""I Want To Kill You Like They Do In the Movies.""
The lawsuit adds: ""Upon arrival, Ms. Bianco found that there was no crew present and she was expected to stay at Mr. Warner's home"" for the shoot. Bianco alleges that she was plied with drugs and alcohol, and deprived of food and sleep, during filming.

The lawsuit accuses the rock star of tying her up, beating her with a whip and electrocuting her, as well as threatening to come to her room and rape her during the night.
Bianco said she was worried that if she protested her professional opportunities would be affected and she was convinced that Manson was just ""eccentric.""
She states that she has never seen the footage filmed and, to her knowledge, this music video has never been released.
Manson and Bianco began a relationship in May 2009, during which she alleges that he degraded her in public, making her sit at his feet during appearances.
Although their sexual relationship was consensual, Bianco has also accused him of bruising and biting Bianco without consent.
They then began a long-distance relationship, during which time Bianco claimed Manson was securing her a visa to work and live with him in the U.S.
She went to the U.S. in 2011, but alleges that he used this visa as a way to control and manipulate her.
According to the lawsuit, Manson kept her in a dark apartment, locking her inside, depriving her of sleep and frequently verbally abusing her. On one occasion, he allegedly chased her around the apartment with an ax.
She also alleges that he cut her with a knife during sex—then photographed the cuts and posted them online without her consent.
The lawsuit accuses Manson of breaking the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act by forcing Bianco to work unpaid and insinuating that she must provide him with sexual intimacy. She also alleges that he raped her and had sexual contact with her while she was unconscious.
Bianco said she escaped the apartment in July 2011.
She is also suing Ciulla, claiming that the manager and his company ""benefited financially from allowing the abuse to continue.""
She alleges that they supported his actions ""to encourage the creation of his 'art'"" and only parted ways from him in February 2021, when abuse allegations were made public.
The court documents state that Bianco is still dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression, and is coming forward now after taking ""years to understand the extent"" of the alleged abuse.
Actress Evan Rachel Wood, who was once engaged to Manson, and a number of other women have accused the rock star of abuse. Manson has denied all the allegations against him.

Marilyn Manson (52) wehrt sich weiter gegen die gegen ihn erhobenen Missbrauchsvorwürfe. Anfang des Jahres wurde der Musiker unter anderem von ""Game of Thrones""-Star Esme Bianco (39) verklagt. Sie wirft ihm sexuelle Übergriffe und Missbrauch vor. Kurz darauf hatte bereits Mansons Anwalt erklärt, die Vorwürfe seien ""nachweislich falsch"".
""Fox News"" berichtet nun unter Berufung auf neue Gerichtsunterlagen, dass Manson alle gegen ihn erhobene Anschuldigungen bestreitet. Biancos Behauptungen seien ""unwahr, unbegründet und eine Schlüsselkomponente eines koordinierten Angriffs mehrerer Klägerinnen, die zynisch und unehrlich versuchen, die #MeToo-Bewegung zu monetarisieren und auszunutzen"", heißt es demnach in den Dokumenten.
Manson wurde in den vergangenen Monaten von mehreren Frauen beschuldigt, sexuelle Übergriffe begangen zu haben. Neben Bianco hat ihn unter anderem auch seine ehemalige Assistentin verklagt. Diese Personen hätten Monate damit verbracht, soll laut ""Fox News"" in den Dokumenten weiter behauptet werden, ""ihre Geschichten zu planen, zu erarbeiten und zu verfeinern, um die einvernehmlichen Freundschaften und Beziehungen"" mit Manson ""in verdrehte Geschichten zu verwandeln, die keine Ähnlichkeit mit der Realität haben"". Es gebe nicht den Hauch eines Beweises für die Anschuldigungen. Außerdem weisen Manson und sein juristisches Team demnach angeblich auch auf die Verjährungsfrist hin.
Evan Rachel Wood machte den Anfang
Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte im Februar dieses Jahres ""Westworld""-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (33), die mehrere Jahre mit Manson liiert gewesen war. Wood hatte auf Instagram behauptet, dass Manson sie ""jahrelang schrecklich missbraucht"" habe. Sie sei ""einer Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und durch Manipulation zur Unterwerfung gebracht"" worden.
Ende April war bekannt geworden, dass die britische Schauspielerin Esmé Bianco Klage gegen den Musiker eingereicht hat. Bianco, die unter anderem durch ihre Rolle in ""Game of Thrones"" bekannt wurde, behauptet in den Gerichtsunterlagen, dass Manson sie mehrfach zum Geschlechtsverkehr gezwungen habe. Sie wirft ihm zudem vor, sie unter Drogen gesetzt und bedroht zu haben.
Manson wies von Beginn an alle Vorwürfe von sich. In einem Statement teilte er mit: ""Offensichtlich waren mein Leben und meine Kunst lange Zeit Magneten für Kontroversen, aber diese jüngsten Behauptungen über mich sind schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität."" Sein Musiklabel und sein Manager hatten später die Zusammenarbeit mit Manson beendet.",2021-07-29T08:39:00Z,https://www.stern.de,STERN.de
Marilyn Manson's lawyers say Game Of Thrones star Esme Bianco 'plotted' horror rape accusations,"MARILYN Manson has claimed Game Of Thrones star Esme Bianco's accusations that he electrocuted and cut her in a horror rape are a contrived ""plot"" to gain cash and discredit him.
The embattled rocker's lawyers came out against the Game of Thrones actress's sexual assault claims on Wednesday, saying she's the statute of limitations allowing her to sue him has long passed.

Bianco ""spent months plotting, workshopping, and fine-tuning"" her story into ""twisted tales that bear no resemblance to reality"", according to a court filing from Manson's legal team seen by TMZ.
Manson and his lawyers add that her claims are part of a ""coordinated attack"" by multiple women who say he sexually assaulted them.
The allegations are an attempt to ""cynically and dishonestly... monetize and exploit the #MeToo movement"", the doc says.
The court documents do not detail whether Manson has denied having sex with the women.
Instead, the document says all of his encounters with his accusers were ""consensual"" relationships.
Manson and his lawyers claim in the filing that Bianco and his other accusers are instead hoping to take advantage of his shock image and conflate that with a horrifying but fabricated claim of abuse.
Bianco has previously claimed the rock star had tied her down and whipped her, electrocuted her and cut her with a knife.
Manson has denied any wrongdoing, with his attorney saying Bianco's claims are ""provably false.""

Marilyn Manson alega que acusação de estupro contra ele foi planejada,"Marilyn Manson entrou com uma ação para que o processo por estupro e tortura feito contra ele pela atriz Esme Bianco, de Game of Thrones, seja recusada pelo juiz. Segundo o cantor, a acusação, além de falsa, teria acontecido ""tarde demais"" para que pudesse ser feita. O crime supostamente aconteceu em 2009.
O documento, obtido pelo site TMZ, diz que a atriz foi muito além da data-limite para levar o caso ao tribunal, e, por isso, não deveria ser ouvida pela corte.
O advogado de Manson ainda declara que as acusações de Esme fazem parte de um ""ataque coordenado"" de várias mulheres que, segundo ele, estariam ""cínica e desonestamente"" tentando explorar o movimento #MeToo, que denuncia casos de abuso sexual.
A equipe de Manson alega que a atriz ""passou meses planejando e aperfeiçoando"" sua história para criar um relato ""distorcido que não condiz com a realidade"".

Marilyn Manson Files to Dismiss Esmé Bianco's Sexual Assault Lawsuit,"Marilyn Manson’s attorneys have filed to dismiss the lawsuit of “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco, in which she accuses Manson of sexual assault and battery.
Back in April, Bianco filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Manson — whose legal name is Brian Warner — raped her in May 2011, among other acts of sexual violence. The lawsuit lays out Bianco’s claims in harrowing detail, describing her allegations that Manson repeatedly used drugs, force and threats to coerce her into sexual acts.
In a new court filing, which was submitted on Wednesday, Manson’s attorneys asked for the suit to be dismissed, writing that Bianco’s claims “are untrue, meritless, and a key component of a coordinated attack by multiple plaintiffs, who are cynically and dishonestly seeking to monetize and exploit the #MeToo movement.” Representatives for Bianco did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.
Bianco first came forward against Manson in February, shortly after Evan Rachel Wood posted on Instagram her allegations that Manson had “horrifically” abused her, and that she was “brainwashed and manipulated into submission.” In an interview with The Cut, Bianco alleged that Manson had psychologically abused her, whipped and cut her without her consent and chased her around his apartment with an ax. After Wood’s statement, Manson posted a message to his Instagram, calling the claims “horrible distortions of reality.” He has continued to deny the allegations. Manson’s attorneys echoed the same rhetoric in Wednesday’s filing, writing that the allegations are “twisted tales that bear no resemblance to reality.”
Following the allegations against Manson in February, he was dropped by his manager, record label and CAA. In June, Manson turned himself in to the Los Angeles Police Department on an outstanding charge for allegedly assaulting a videographer during a 2019 concert in New Hampshire. He has since been released on personal recognizance bail.",2021-07-29T01:36:35Z,https://variety.com,Variety
Marilyn Manson Files to Dismiss Esme Bianco's Sex Assault Claims,"Marilyn Manson filed a motion to dismiss sexual assault and battery claims against the him.
""Game of Thrones"" actress Esmé Bianco filed a lawsuit in April accusing him of sexual abuse.
Manson is claiming the allegations hold no weight due to California's statute of limitations laws.
Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.
Marilyn Manson's attorneys on Wednesday filed a motion to dismiss ""Game of Thrones"" actress Esme Bianco's sexual assault and battery claims against the shock rock artist, arguing that they had no merit based on California's statute of limitations law.
In the new motion reviewed by Insider, attorney Howard King said that Bianco's claims were ""a key component of a coordinated attack by multiple plaintiffs, who are cynically and dishonestly seeking to monetize and exploit the #MeToo movement.""
Insider reached out to Bianco's attorney for a comment on the new filing.
In April, Bianco filed a civil suit in federal court against Marilyn Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, accusing him of sexual assault and battery.
Her lawsuit said that Manson ""committed sexual acts"" with the actress without her consent. Bianco said that, at times, she was unconscious, and the lawsuit also described instances of physical abuse, forced drug use, and threats of violence.
Bianco claimed that when they were briefly dating, Manson violated human trafficking laws by flying her from London to Los Angeles for a music video that was not released and a film that she also alleged was staged so that he could see her and later physically abuse her.
Bianco and Manson dated in 2011, and Bianco first spoke publicly about the allegations in a New York Magazine interview in February.
Prior to Bianco's interview, multiple women had accused Manson of abuse, including Evan Rachel Wood, who said the singer ""groomed"" her during their relationship, and Wolf Alice singer Ellie Rowsell said Manson subjected her to years of sexual and physical abuse.
Manson denied the allegations made by the women and called them ""horrible distortions of reality"" in February.
Bianco was the first person to take legal action against Manson. In February, he was also dropped from his label Loma Vista records.
Howard King, an attorney representing Manson, had previously told Insider that Bianco's allegations are ""provably false.""
""To be clear, this suit was only filed after my client refused to be shaken down by Ms. Bianco and her lawyer and give in to their outrageous financial demands based on conduct that simply never occurred. We will vigorously contest these allegations in court and are confident that we will prevail,"" King said in April.
The new filings by King allege that Bianco's claims are ""​​governed by the two-year statute of limitations in California Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1"" and that they should be dismissed.
""Because the statute of limitations expired in 2013 and Plaintiff did not file her claims until 2021, her sexual assault and battery claims are not actionable and should be dismissed,"" King wrote.
Manson's attorney alleged that California's code Of Civil Procedure Section 340.16, which was amended in 2019 to include a ten-year Statute Of Limitations for adult claims of sexual abuse, does not apply to the case because the abuse allegedly occurred in 2011, and ""the statute does not revive claims that lapsed under the former limitations period.""
King also argued that the case should be dismissed because Bianco did not separately plead for an exception to the statutes of limitations.",2021-07-28T04:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Marilyn Manson Claims Assault Allegations are ‘Coordinated Attack’,"Esmé Bianco’s harrowing accusations of sexual assault and abuse at the hands of Marilyn Manson are “untrue, meritless,” and part of a “coordinated attack by multiple plaintiffs,” the goth-rocker claims in a new court filing.
Earlier this year, Bianco, a star from the hit HBO series Game of Thrones, stepped forward to join others who’ve accused the musician of years-long abusive behavior. In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Bianco claimed that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England under the false pretenses of roles in music videos and movies that never materialized.
According to Bianco’s suit, Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, deprived her of food and sleep, plied her with alcohol and drugs, locked her in a bedroom, whipped her, gave her electric shocks, and made threats to rape her during the night.",2021-07-28T04:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

Marilyn Manson é acusado de ameaçar filho de 8 anos de Evan Rachel Wood,"A atriz Evan Rachel Wood, da série “Westworld”, alega, em documentos judiciais, que seu ex-namorado Marilyn Manson ameaçou seu filho de oito anos. A declaração foi feita nos documentos relacionados a uma disputa judicial pela guarda da criança, fruto do relacionamento de Wood com o ator Jamie Bell.
Em fevereiro, Evan afirmou ter sofrido uma série de abusos durante seu relacionamento com Manson. Após a denúncia, outras mulheres compartilharam as próprias experiências negativas com o roqueiro, que agora é alvo de processos por estupro, tortura, violência sexual, aprisionamento ilegal, e tráfico sexual.
Segundo o jornal britânico Daily Mail, Evan Rachel Wood afirmou em abril em papéis judiciais que o músico ameaçou “ferrar” com seu filho, Jack, além de ameaçá-la de morte e afirmar que iria “destruir” as famílias das outras mulheres que o acusam. A atriz afirma ter instalado vidros à prova de balas, uma porta de metal e uma cerca de segurança em sua casa após as ameaças.
No começo do ano, ela saiu da cidade de Los Angeles com o filho para morar em Nashville, no estado do Tennessee, por conta de sua “preocupação com a segurança” da criança. “Eu tenho medo extremo do suposto abusador”, diz. “Eu sofri traumas e danos físicos e emocionais severos nas mãos dele, e tenho medo que ele busque vingança contra mim por depor machucando a mim, meu filho, e membros da minha família”.
Wood afirma ter ouvido de outra das supostas vítimas que Manson teria fotos de seus filhos, além de seus registros sociais. Ele teria dito à mulher, cuja identidade não foi revelada, que sabe onde suas famílias moram, onde as crianças estudam, onde elas e seus pais trabalham, e que “eles estão fodidos, e vão ser destruídos”.
A disputa judicial entre Evan Rachel Wood e o ex-marido está relacionada à mudança da atriz para Nashville. Jamie Bell a acusa de querer afastá-lo de seu filho.
“Eu não entendo o que está acontecendo”, afirmou o ator, ao tribunal, segundo o Daily Mail. “Ou as alegações de que Evan está recebendo ‘ameaças de morte’ são verdadeiras e Jack não está seguro com ela, ou não são verdadeiras e ela está separando nosso filho de mim por outras razões inventadas por ela”.
A sequência de acusações a Marilyn Manson começou com texto publicado por Evan em suas redes sociais. Ela afirma que era adolescente quando conheceu o cantor, e diz ter sido “abusada e manipulada” por ele durante anos.
Manson negou todas as acusações em seu Instagram, chamando-as de “distorções horrorosas da realidade”.",2021-07-12T08:46:00Z,https://jornaldebrasilia.com.br,Jornal de Brasília

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rocker Marilyn Manson surrendered to police in Los Angeles last week in connection with a 2019 arrest warrant out of New Hampshire where he allegedly assaulted a videographer at a concert, authorities said.
Manson, whose legal name is Brian Hugh Warner, is charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from an alleged incident on Aug. 19, 2019 at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford.
Gilford police Chief Anthony J. Bean Burpee said Thursday that Manson had turned himself into law enforcement in Los Angeles the week before. Manson was booked and released without bail pending a court appearance in New Hampshire.
Manson’s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.
The victim, a videographer, was in the venue’s stage pit area at the time of the alleged assault, Gilford police previously said. The misdemeanor charges can each result in a jail sentence of less than a year and a $2,000 fine if convicted.

Marilyn Manson surrenders to police on New Hampshire arrest warrant,"Marilyn Manson has turned himself in to authorities in response to a New Hampshire arrest warrant for the alleged assault of a videographer in 2019.
Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, turned himself in to the Los Angeles county sheriff’s department 2 July following an agreement made in late June between his lawyer and New Hampshire authorities regarding the warrant, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Manson was released without bail.
The alleged assault took place in August 2019 at a concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford, New Hampshire. Manson is charged with two misdemeanor accounts of simple assault. If convicted, Manson faces a possible prison sentence and up to $2,000 in fines.
Howard King, Manson’s lawyer, in a statement about the incident to Rolling Stone, said that Manson likes to be “provocative on stage, especially in front of the camera”.
“The misdemeanor claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm,” King said.
“This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout.”
Separate to the assault charges, Los Angeles county sheriff’s department special victim’s bureau has been investigating Manson for alleged incidents of domestic violence that took place between 2009 and 2011 while Manson lived in West Hollywood.
In February, the actor Evan Rachel Wood accused Manson of “horrific” abuse while they were in a relationship. Four other women subsequently came out with allegations against Manson, all of which Manson has denied.
Following the allegations, Manson has been dropped from his record label, talent agency and the recurring role he had on the television show American Gods.",2021-07-09T13:48:36Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian

Marilyn Manson løslatt etter avhør om spyttkrangel
Marilyn Manson (52) meldte seg i hemmelighet for politiet for en uke siden.

Publisert: Oppdatert nå nettopp
Politiet i New Hampshire utstedte for halvannet år siden en arrestordre på «sjokkrockeren», uten at han skal ha meldt seg. Men nå er det gjort.
2. juli møtte Manson opp hos politiet i Los Angeles, som skal ha fått arrestordren oversendt. Manson bor nemlig i L.A.
Den aktuelle saken har ikke sammenheng med de mange andre alvorlige anklagene som er blitt fremsatt mot musikeren i år, nemlig at Manson skal ha forgrepet seg og trakassert kvinner i en årrekke. I stedet er stridens kjerne en hendelse som skal ha funnet sted under en konsert i New Hampshire i august 2019.
Skal ha spyttet på kvinne
Manson skal ifølge siktelsen ha spyttet og snytt seg på en kvinnelig videofotograf.
I slutten av juni ble det klart at Manson omsider hadde gått med på å melde seg, og at det ville skje innen kort tid.
Artisten har imidlertid klart å oppsøke politiet uten at offentligheten fanget det opp der og da. Fox News får nyheten bekreftet fra politiet i Gilford.
De kan også opplyse at Manson, som egentlig heter Brian Warner, ble løslatt mot kausjon etter avhør.
Betingelsene for løslatelsen er at Manson ikke begår kriminelle handlinger, og at han møter opp til alle rettsmøter han pålegges. Han må opplyse om alle eventuelle adresseforandringer innen 24 timer, og han forbys å ta kontakt med fornærmede i saken.
Videre saksgang skal ifølge Fox News foregå i New Hampshire. Manson skal ha fått en dato for neste høring, men denne er ikke kjent.
Mansons apparat har ikke besvart Fox’ sine henvendelser.
Større etterforskning
Manson er fra før under etterforskning av føderale myndigheter for andre forhold. «Game of Thrones»-skuespiller Esmé Bianco (39) har saksøkt ham for seksuell, fysisk og emosjonell mishandling i perioden 2009–2011.
Selv nekter Manson konsekvent for anklagene.
Snøballen begynte å rulle da Mansons eksforlovede, skuespiller Evan Rachel Wood (33), i januar ut med anklager om vold og seksuelle overgrep.
Siden har flere stått frem med beskyldninger, deriblant Mansons tidligere assistent, som har saksøkt ham for trakassering og for å ha forgrepet seg på henne.
Mansons manager, bookingbyrå og plateselskap har droppet sine samarbeid med 52-åringen, og han har fått fyken fra flere TV-prosjekter.
Etter at han gikk ut på Instagram 2. februar og omtalte beskyldningene fra eksen som «grusomme forvrengninger av virkeligheten», har Manson ikke lagt ut noen nye poster.",2021-07-09T11:23:08Z,https://www.vg.no,VG
Marilyn Manson released on bail after turning himself in on assault charges,"American singer-songwriter Marilyn Manson has turned himself in to authorities in Los Angeles on an active arrest warrant in connection to assault charges he is facing in New Hampshire. According to Fox News, the Gilford Police Department said the shock rocker, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, surrendered himself to law enforcement in LA on July 2.
He finally answered an October 2019 arrest warrant ""for acts alleged to have occurred on August 19, 2019, while performing a concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford, NH."" The warrant was issued for two counts of Class A misdemeanor simple assault.

Manson was processed and released on personal recognizance bail under the conditions that he does not commit a federal, state or local crime while on release and that he appears at all court proceedings as ordered. Furthermore, Manson has to advise the court in writing about all changes of addresses within 24-hours of doing so and he is to have no contact with the alleged victim.
He has been given an unspecified court date to appear at the 4th Circuit Court, District Division in Laconia, New Hampshire. The police had told Fox News in May that Manson was performing a concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion on August 18, 2019, when the alleged simple assaults occurred.
Authorities explained that in New Hampshire, arrest warrants can be issued by bail commissioners and thus, the initial assault report was investigated and an arrest warrant affidavit was prepared by the investigating officer. The affidavit was then presented to a bail commissioner and reviewed for probable cause, which police said they found through their investigation and an arrest warrant was issued on October 8, 2019.
Police have not released the name of the videographer, but authorities previously relayed to Fox News that the video person was subcontracted by a local company to film the concert and had been located in the stage pit area when the alleged assaults occurred. Manson's attorney, Howard King issued a statement to Fox News at the time, calling allegations from showgoers to People magazine that Manson ""shot snot"" out of his nose, ""ludicrous.""
The statement read, ""It is no secret to anyone who has attended a Marilyn Manson concert that he likes to be provocative on stage, especially in front of a camera. This misdemeanour claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than USD 35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm. After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply."" In the statement, King further continued, ""This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout.""
As per Fox News, one of the concertgoers alleged that Manson had no regard for the cameraperson when he allegedly carried on spitting at the photog during the performance. (ANI)

Die Polizei in Gilford (US-Staat New Hampshire) hatte im Mai bekanntgegeben, dass ein Haftbefehl gegen den 52-jährigen Musiker vorliege. Manson sei nun vorige Woche in Los Angeles vorstellig geworden, teilte der Polizei-Chef von Gilford, Bean Burpee, am Donnerstag der Zeitung „USA Today“ und anderen US-Medien mit. Gegen Kaution kam der Musiker frei. Der Fall soll im August in New Hampshire vor Gericht gehen.
Der Haftbefehl geht auf einen Vorfall mit einer Kamerafrau bei einem Konzertauftritt des Rockers im August 2019 in Gilford zurück. Nach US-Medienberichten soll der Rocker bei dem Konzert eine Filmkamera bespuckt haben. „TMZ.com“ veröffentlichte ein kurzes Video von einem Spuckvorfall. Drei Konzertgänger beschrieben im Interview der Zeitschrift „People“, dass eine Kamerafrau mehrfach bespuckt worden sei. Mansons Anwalt Howard King bezeichnete die Vorwürfe im Mai als „lächerlich“. Es sei bekannt, dass Manson auf der Bühne gerne provoziere, „besonders vor der Kamera“, sagte King.

Seine Kunst und sein Leben seien schon lange „Magnete für Kontroversen“, aber die Behauptungen über ihn seien „schreckliche Verfälschungen der Realität“, schrieb der Musiker im Februar auf Instagram.

Marilyn Manson surrenders to police on assault arrest warrant,"Singer Marilyn Manson was arrested by California police after he surrendered on an outstanding New Hampshire warrant.
Gilford, New Hampshire, Police Chief Anthony J. Bean Burpee confirmed that Manson, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, turned himself in to police in Los Angeles last Friday on a warrant connected to a concert in Gilford in August 2019.
Gilford police said in May that the arrest warrant on two counts of misdemeanor assault was issued in October 2019 and that Manson has ""been aware of the warrant for some time,"" NBC News reported.
Manson was processed and released on ""personal recognizance bail"" and other conditions, among them that he have no contact with the alleged victim, Bean Burpee wrote.
""As an agency, we are pleased with Mr. Warner's decision to finally address the arrest warrant that has been outstanding since 2019,"" Bean Burpee said in a statement.
Bean Burpee said a court date will be set after New Hampshire authorities receive bail paperwork in the mail from Los Angeles.
""Mr. Warner's attorney will know that date once it has been confirmed with him,"" Bean Burpee said.
Kent M. Barker, Manson's attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for Manson declined to comment.
When the arrest warrant was first publicized in May, Howard King, an attorney for Manson, called the allegations ""ludicrous"" and said, ""It is no secret to anyone who has attended a Marilyn Manson concert that he likes to be provocative on stage, especially in front of a camera.""
""This misdemeanor claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm. After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply,"" King said.
A string of allegations has arisen against Manson in recent months, all unrelated to the New Hampshire arrest warrant.
Phoebe Bridgers said in February that she had seen Manson point out what he called a rape room in his home when she visited as a teen. She made her statement on Twitter days after actor Evan Rachel Wood, Manson's former partner, said Manson had abused her.
In an Instagram post shared the same day as Wood's accusation, Manson said: ""My art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office has confirmed that it has launched a domestic violence investigation into the goth rock star.
In April, Manson was sued by ""Game of Thrones"" actor Esmé Bianco, who alleged that Manson dangled fraudulent work opportunities and used ""force and/or threats of force"" to get his way.
In response to Bianco's suit, King, Manson's attorney, said in a statement obtained by People magazine that Manson would ""vigorously contest these allegations in court.""
""To be clear, this suit was only filed after my client refused to be shaken down by Ms. Bianco and her lawyer and give in to their outrageous financial demands based on conduct that simply never occurred,"" King wrote in the statement.
In May, Manson's former personal assistant also sued him, alleging sexual exploitation and psychological abuse; Manson's representative at the time denied any accusation of assault.
Also in May, an unnamed ex-partner of Manson's filed a lawsuit under the name ""Jane Doe"" alleging that Manson had raped her; a member of Manson's team ""strongly denied"" the allegations in a statement at the time.
A representative for Bianco told NBC News that the FBI and Los Angeles police have interviewed Bianco multiple times since February and that she is in active conversations with law enforcement.
The FBI said it would not confirm or deny any investigation.
Manson, through a spokesperson, declined to comment on the allegation that the authorities have interviewed Bianco.

Marilyn Manson geeft zichzelf aan bij politie voor spuugincident,"Nadat Marilyn Manson (52) eind juni aankondigde zichzelf aan te gaan geven bij de autoriteiten in Los Angeles vanwege een uitstaande arrestatie uit 2019, heeft de zanger dat nu ook daadwerkelijk gedaan. Manson, wiens eigenlijke naam Brian Warner is, zou destijds een videojournalist zou hebben aangevallen tijdens een concert in New Hampshire. Nadat hij zichzelf aangaf mocht hij zonder het betalen van een borgsom weer vertrekken. Dit meldt Page Six.
In overleg met de politie in Gilford, New Hampshire, waar het incident in 2019 plaatsvond, is overeengekomen dat Manson zich daar in augustus meldt om terecht te staan voor zijn vergrijp. Hij zou meerdere malen op de camera van een vrouwelijke journalist gespuugd hebben tijdens zijn optreden, wat tegen de regels van de organisatie in ging.
""Hij spuugde erop los en op een gegeven moment zat het op de camera, wat de journalist logischerwijs irriteerde. Daarna 'vuurde' hij nog een enorme bel snot op haar persoonlijk af, waar hij zelf heel hard om moest lachen maar wat zij allerminst grappig vond,"" aldus een ooggetuige.
Mansons advocaat vindt de aanklacht 'belachelijk', maar zegt dat de zanger alle medewerking zal verlenen aan de autoriteiten. Mocht Manson veroordeeld worden dan kan hij een paar maanden vast komen te zitten en moet hij een boete van 1700 euro betalen.
De excentrieke zanger lag de afgelopen maanden sowieso al onder vuur, nadat meerdere vrouwen hem aanklaagden voor seksueel misbruik, waaronder actrices Evan Rachel Wood en Esmé Bianco. Zij claimen dat Manson hen tegen hun wil in misbruikte, vernederde en volledig manipuleerde. Als gevolg daarvan zette onder meer Mansons platenmaatschappij en management hem aan de kant.

Marilyn Manson surrendered to Los Angeles authorities yesterday in connection with assault charges he faces in New Hampshire.
Manson, 52, was released without bail after turning himself in at a Hollywood police station, People reported.
Under a deal reached with the Gilford, NH Police Department, Manson will travel to New England in August to be arraigned on two misdemeanour charges stemming from an incident in which the rocker allegedly spit on a camerawoman during a 2019 concert.
“He was spitting everywhere and one time it got on her camera so she wiped it off and looked semi-irritated,” one witness told the magazine.
“I think her final straw is he got on the floor, got within 2-3 feet (60cm-90cm) of her and hacked a giant snot rocket at her, not the camera. She was pissed off and disgusted so she stormed off and he just laughed.”

Marilyn Manson Out on Bail After Turning Himself in on Assault Charges,"Watch : Marilyn Manson Speaks Out After Abuse Allegations
Marilyn Manson spent time in a police jail last week after turning himself in to Los Angeles police in response to an out-of-state arrest warrant over an alleged spitting incident.
The 52-year-old rocker, whose birth name is Brian Warner, faces two class A misdemeanor assault charges following the reported incident involving a videographer while performing in Gilford, New Hampshire in 2019. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department inmate records show Manson was detained at an L.A. jail on July 2.
Anthony J. Bean Burpee, chief of police in Gilford, told E! News in a statement on Thursday, July 8, that the rocker turned himself in to L.A. authorities in relation to the 2019 arrest warrant issued for acts that allegedly took place at the New Hampshire concert. Manson was processed and released on personal recognizance bail, the police chief said.

"Marilyn Manson se entrega à polícia, após um mês como foragido","Reprodução/Instagram
Marilyn Manson se entregou à polícia de New Hampshire, nos Estados Unidos, após um mês como procurado. Acusado de ter cuspido em um cinegrafista, o músico compareceu ao departamento da polícia local no dia 2 de julho, informou o TMZ.
A polícia confirmou que a suposta agressão ocorreu durante o show em agosto de 2019, e também explicou que o cinegrafista foi contratato pela produção do evento.
Fontes familiarizadas com o caso disseram que o cameraman alegou ter sido atingindo por parte da cusparada de Manson, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Hugh Warner. Isso teria sido o principal motivo para que a polícia fosse procurada.
De acordo com o TMZ, Manson foi liberado depois de pagar uma fiança de cerca de 2 mil dólares. O músico teve de se comprometer a não cometer outros crimes enquanto estiver em liberdade e terá de comparecer às audiências judiciais.
Ainda segundo o site norte-americano, as autoridades emitiram o mandado de prisão pela primeira vez em outubro de 2019, mas em maio deste ano disseram que Manson estava “se esquivando.”
A ficha de Manson ainda tem um processo polêmico em que pelo menos 15 mulheres o acusam de abuso e agressão sexual. Muitas delas são ex-namoradas do cantor. Entre as famosas que denunciaram o cantor, estão Evan Rachel Wood, Phoebe Bridgers e Esmé Bianco, que descreveu cenas de tortura durante a gravação de um clipe que fez com Marilyn.
Em seu instagram pessoal, Manson negou todas as acusações.",2021-07-08T21:15:00Z,https://www.ofuxico.com.br,OFuxico

Per Haftbefehl gesucht: Marilyn Manson stellt sich der Polizei
08.07.2021, 22:02 Uhr | dpa, jdo, t-online
Seit Mai suchten die Behörden offiziell nach dem Schockrocker. Nun kam Marilyn Manson selbst auf die Wache, um sich mit den Anschuldigungen gegen seine Person auseinanderzusetzen.
Vor zwei Monaten hatte die Polizei von Gilford im US-Staat New Hampshire bekannt gegeben, dass ein Haftbefehl gegen Marilyn Manson vorliegt. Der Vorwurf: Körperverletzung. Dies gehe auf einen Vorfall bei einem Konzertauftritt des Rockers im August 2019 in Gilford zurück, gab die Behörde auf ihrer Facebookseite an.
Dabei soll Manson eine Kamerafrau, die vor der Bühne positioniert war, mehrfach bespuckt und attackiert haben. Drei Konzertgänger bezeugten den Vorfall in der Zeitschrift ""People"", das US-Portal ""TMZ"" veröffentlichte sogar ein kurzes Video. Mansons Anwalt Howard King bezeichnete die Vorwürfe im Mai hingegen als ""lächerlich"". Es sei bekannt, dass sein Mandant auf der Bühne gerne provoziere, ""besonders vor der Kamera"".
Gerichtsverhandlung im August
Die Anschuldigungen wurden erfasst, Manson kehrte allerdings nie nach New Hampshire zurück, um sich zu stellen. Ende Juni erklärten die Anwälte des 52-Jährigen dann, eine Einigung mit der Polizei erreicht zu haben. Manson wolle sich den Behörden stellen und sich vor Gericht verantworten. Das hat er nun getan: Er sei vorige Woche in Los Angeles vorstellig geworden, teilte der Polizeichef von Gilford, Bean Burpee, mehreren US-Medien mit. Gegen Kaution kam der Musiker frei, der Fall soll im August in New Hampshire vor Gericht gehen.
Nicht die einzigen Anschuldigungen, mit denen sich Marilyn Manson aktuell auseinandersetzen muss. Mehrere Frauen haben in den letzten Monaten Vorwürfe oder Klagen gegen den Rocker wegen sexueller oder physischer Gewalt vorgebracht. So warf unter anderem Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood ihrem Ex-Freund im Februar in einem Instagram-Posting jahrelangen ""grauenhaften"" Missbrauch vor. Die Polizei in Los Angeles leitete daraufhin eine Untersuchung zu Vorwürfen häuslicher Gewalt ein.
Der Sänger hatte damals die Vorwürfe umgehend zurückgewiesen.

(NEXSTAR) – Rock musician Marilyn Manson is free on bail after turning himself in to Los Angeles police on Friday, a police department in New Hampshire confirmed on Thursday.
Manson, born Brian Hugh Warner in Canton, Ohio, was expected to turn himself in on assault charges stemming from an alleged incident at a New Hampshire concert in 2019. An in-house prosecutor with the Gilford Police Department had previously reached a deal with Manson’s attorneys after the department shared news on Facebook last month of their active arrest warrant for him.
“Mr. Warner, his agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the pending charges,” police wrote at the time.
Manson eventually turned himself in Friday, July 2, and was released on personal recognizance bail under the condition that he refrain from contact with the alleged victim and appear at a future court date in New Hampshire, among other conditions, according to Guilford Police Chief Anthony Bean Burpee.
An arrest warrant had been issued for Manson following an alleged incident that took place at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion on Aug. 18, 2019.
Police had also noted that Manson’s alleged assault charges were “not sexual” in nature, but they did not elaborate on the incident. In a statement shared with People, however, one of Manson’s attorneys had claimed that the incident may have involved a “small amount” of Manson’s spit, which came into contact with the alleged victim — a videographer — during the concert. The attorney had also claimed that the videographer only filed a police report after Manson refused to pay $35,000 for damages to video equipment.
Other witnesses who spoke to the outlet claimed to see Manson spit on the woman’s camera before shooting his “snot” at her, claims that Manson’s attorney called “ludicrous.”
The Gilford police chief, however, had claimed that reports of the videographer asking for a “payout” are false, as the police report was filed “the day after” the alleged incident.
Manson has already been given a court date to appear in New Hampshire, the Guilford Police Department has confirmed.
In 2020, Manson had also been accused of sexual, physical and emotional abuse by over a dozen women including actresses Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco, the Huffington Post reported at the time. He has denied all allegations.",2021-07-08T19:31:16Z,https://fox8.com,WJW FOX 8 News Cleveland

Marilyn Manson Turns Himself In On Assault Charges,"At an August 2019 show, Marilyn Manson decided to do what he does best — shock the public. He leaned in and spat all over a professional videographer’s camera.
Gilford, New Hampshire PD told TMZ the alleged victim suffered ""no injuries,"" but spitting constitutes ""unprivileged physical contact” leading to Manson being charged with two misdemeanor simple assault charges.
Manson had apparently been dodging cops since the warrant for his arrest was first issued in October 2019, shortly after the incident. Almost two years later, Manson turned himself in only to be booked and released on personal recognizance bail.
The singer is in the clear for this charge as long as he does not “commit any crimes while on release, won't have any contact with the alleged victim, and will appear at all of his court hearings” according to TMZ.
This misdemeanor is the least of Manson’s legal concerns as he is facing charges for sexual abuse from four different women who have come forward in recent months, including an ex-girlfriend and former assistant.
Manson shared a statement in response to the earliest claims against him in February, saying, “my intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent that past, that is the truth.”

Marilyn Manson has reportedly turned himself in to police after an arrest warrant was issued over an alleged spit attack on a videographer.
Controversial rocker Marilyn, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, is thought to have given himself up to Gilford Police Department after a warrant was issued against him on two misdemeanour counts of simple assault.
Police Chief Anthony Burpee said in a statement that the singer was processed and released on bail by Los Angeles law enforcement last Friday.
Before he handed himself in, US media had reported that Manson's arraignment could be scheduled by mid-August.
The rock star has been accused of spitting on a videographer during a concert in 2019, with TMZ previously reporting that they had obtained footage of the singer with his face close to the camera before spitting in the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion.

Manson was charged because spitting is considered ""unprivileged physical contact"" though TMZ has reported that the victim received ""no injuries"" from the incident and that some of Manson's ""spit"" had landed on his arm.
Gilford Department detailed Manson's warrant information in a Facebook post in May 2021.
The post read: ""The Gilford Police Department has an active arrest warrant for Brian Hugh Warner (aka: Marilyn Manson) for two counts of Class A misdemeanour.
""The alleged assaults involved a videographer. ... Mr. Warner, his agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the pending charges.""
""Mr. Warner had been performing a concert at the Bank of NH Pavilion on August 18, 2019, when the alleged simple assaults occurred.""
(Image: Getty Images)
The post continued: ""The issuance of an arrest warrant is not a presumption of guilt. The videographer had been subcontracted by a NH-based company to video the concert, and had been located in the stage pit area when the alleged assaults occurred.""
Howard King, Manson's attorney, has described the case as ""ludicrous,"" and said Manson had cooperated with police in their investigation, contrary to a statement by the police.
King said in a statement: “This misdemeanour claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm.
""After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply.
""This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout.”
If Manson is found guilty, the Class A misdemeanour could include a possible jail sentence of less than one year and a fine of $2,000.

Marilyn Manson geeft zichzelf aan bij politie voor spuugincident,"Manson zou destijds een videojournalist zou hebben aangevallen tijdens een concert in New Hampshire. Nadat hij zichzelf aangaf mocht hij zonder het betalen van een borgsom weer vertrekken, meldt Page Six.
In overleg met de politie in Gilford, New Hampshire, waar het incident in 2019 plaatsvond, is overeengekomen dat Manson zich daar in augustus meldt om terecht te staan voor zijn vergrijp. Hij zou meerdere malen op de camera van een vrouwelijke journalist gespuugd hebben tijdens zijn optreden, wat tegen de regels van de organisatie in ging.
„Hij spuugde erop los en op een gegeven moment zat het op de camera, wat de journalist logischerwijs irriteerde. Daarna ’vuurde’ hij nog een enorme bel snot op haar persoonlijk af, waar hij zelf heel hard om moest lachen maar wat zij allerminst grappig vond”, aldus een ooggetuige.
’Belachelijk’
Mansons advocaat vindt de aanklacht ’belachelijk’, maar zegt dat de zanger alle medewerking zal verlenen aan de autoriteiten. Mocht Manson veroordeeld worden dan kan hij een paar maanden vast komen te zitten en moet hij een boete van 1700 euro betalen.
De excentrieke zanger lag de afgelopen maanden sowieso al onder vuur, nadat meerdere vrouwen hem aanklaagden voor seksueel misbruik, waaronder actrices Evan Rachel Wood en Esmé Bianco. Zij claimen dat Manson hen tegen hun wil in misbruikte, vernederde en volledig manipuleerde. Als gevolg daarvan zette onder meer Mansons platenmaatschappij en management hem aan de kant.

Marilyn Manson Turns Self In On Alleged N.H. Assault,"Warner, 52, had earlier agreed to turn himself in to face accusations that he assaulted a videographer at the show; he was charged with two Class A misdemeanor accounts of simple assault and could face a possible jail sentence and a fine of up to $2,000. The police previously said that the alleged assaults were tied to claims by a videographer subcontracted by a N.H.-based company to film the concert; the videographer was in the photo pit in front of the stage when the alleged assaults occurred. The N.H. PD confirmed that the alleged assaults were ""not sexual in nature.""
The singer is also currently facing lawsuits from four women who claim that he sexually, physically and emotionally assaulted them; Warner has denied the allegations. In a Feb. 1 Instagram post, he wrote, ""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth."" He called the allegations ""horrible distortions of reality.""
According to the Gilford Police Department's statement, the next court date in the New Hampshire case has been set -- but was not revealed -- at which Warner is slated to appear at the 4th Circuit Court in Laconia, N.H.
Billboard has reached out to Warner for comment.
The musician's attorney earlier called the claims in the New Hampshire case ""ludicrous,"" even as he said the singer's team was ""committed to cooperating with authorities.""",2021-07-08T04:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

De acordo com o TMZ, o músico compareceu ao departamento da polícia local na última sexta-feira (2). Ele foi libertado sob fiança, além das condições de que não cometerá outros crimes enquanto estiver em liberdade e comparecerá às audiências judiciais.

Marilyn Mason Sang This Romantic Elvis Presley Song at His Wedding,"Elvis Presley’s songs are so popular that singers are covering them to this day. For example, a major 1990s rock star sang one of Elvis’ classic love songs at his wedding. Here’s what he had to say about his performance — and how another celebrity gave him some trouble at the wedding.

Marilyn Manson and another celebrity sang the same Elvis Presley song at the same wedding
The King of Rock ‘n’ Roll might seem wholesome or quaint today, however, he was once controversial. His style of dancing offended many people in the 1950s. Notable, another controversial singer took some cues from him.
Marilyn Manson is perhaps one of the most controversial rockers of all time. In the 1990s, he scandalized many people for his blasphemous lyrics, his unnerving music videos, and his sometimes androynous appearance. While Manson doesn’t sing a lot of love ballads, he performed an Elvis ballad at his wedding.
In Interview Magazine, Nicolas Cage and Manson interviewed each other. “By the way, is it okay to talk about your wedding?” Cage asked Manson. I thought your wedding was beautiful because that’s what you were doing while you were in lockdown. I got to see a little of it on FaceTime, and I thought it was very beautiful, the way you sang ‘Love Me Tender.’”
“Love Me Tender”
RELATED: Elvis Presley’s Producer Called 1 of His Most Famous Songs ‘The Worst Record’
Manson gave fans some insight into the wedding. “You were the only guest at the wedding on FaceTime, he said. ‘And you definitely cock blocked me on singing ‘Love Me Tender,’ because you mentioned you were going to sing it to us, but I had set up a karaoke machine to do it myself. We both sang it in the end, and your version was even more beautiful.”
Marilyn Manson’s other connections to the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll
The connections between Elvis and Manson extend beyond that. Manson appeared on the show Ride with Norman Reedus. On the show, Manson said Elvis was his mother’s favorite singer. Because of this, he decided to dye his hair black. This is notable, as Manson appears with black hair on most of his album covers and in most of his music videos.
“God’s Gonna Cut You Down”
RELATED: Elvis Presley Was Angry ‘For Days’ When He Had to Sing This Kids’ Song
Manson once recorded a version of the American folk song “God’s Gonna Cut You Down.” Prior to releasing his cover of the song , the most famous versions of it were the ones by Elvis and Johnny Cash. Manson also covered Elvis’ classic ballad “In the Ghetto.”
Manson paid tribute to Elvis over social media. According to MetalHeadZone, he posted an Instagram picture of the “Can’t Help Falling in Love” singer next to an image of David Bowie. In the caption, Manson referred to Elvis and Bowie as his two greatest sources of inspiration. Without the “Love Me Tender” singer, Manson’s music, hair, and wedding might not be the same.

Marilyn Manson recibe una nueva demanda por agresión sexual tras pactar su entrega a la policía,"Marilyn Manson recibe una nueva demanda por agresión sexual tras pactar su entrega a la policía Una modelo ha puesto la cuarta denuncia al cantante, que había llegado a un acuerdo con las autoridades para ser detenido voluntariamente
Nacho Serrano Actualizado: 03/07/2021 00:59h Guardar Enviar noticia por correo electrónico Tu nombre * Tu correo electrónico * Su correo electrónico *
Tras las denuncias interpuestas por tres mujeres que le acusan de varios delitos de abusos sexuales y psicológicos, Marilyn Manson acaba de recibir una cuarta demanda por agresión sexual y retención ilegal. Se trata de la modelo Ashley Morgan Smithline, quien asegura que fue violada, golpeada y secuestrada por el cantante, que además la habría amenazado de muerte en repetidas ocasiones, insinuando que la mataría si abandonaba la relación que mantenían.
Un representante de Manson, cuyo nombre real es Brian Warner, ha rechazado las acusaciones de la misma manera que hizo con las anteriores: «Negamos enérgicamente las afirmaciones de la Sra. Smithline. Hay tantas falsedades dentro de sus afirmaciones que no sabríamos por dónde empezar a responderlas. Esta relación, en la medida limitada en que fue una relación, duró menos de una semana en 2010. Manson no ha visto a la Sra. Smithline desde entonces».
La denuncia va en la misma línea de las declaraciones que hizo la modelo a la revista People, cuando salieron a la luz las primeras demandas. «Sobreviví a un monstruo. Me propinaba golpes y me mordía durante las relaciones sexuales. También me cortó con un cuchillo con forma de esvástica a modo de 'broma', por mi ascendencia judía. Me obligó a hacer un pacto de sangre, y si no obedecía, me encerraba en lo que él llamaba 'la habitación de las chicas malas', que era una sala de cristal insonorizada».
Smithline relató que Warner la contactó por primera vez en el verano de 2010, pidiéndole fotografías y diciendo que quería incluirla en una película. Según los documentos judiciales, Warner se «encaprichó» de ella y dijo que «era la chica perfecta para él». En noviembre de 2010 la llevó en avión a Los Ángeles, diciendo que la había elegido para un remake de la película 'True Romance' de Patricia Arquette. Poco después de su llegada, él le pidió que se mudara a su apartamento y comenzaron una relación sexual consensuada. «Sin embargo, rápidamente se hizo evidente que el sexo consensuado no era suficiente para el señor Warner», argumenta la demandante, que asegura que en una ocasión fue violada mientras estaba inconsciente. «Al despertarme descubrí lo que me estaba haciendo».
También la agredió físicamente, la obligó a ver escenas de películas que mostraban abusos y asesinatos, y fue sometida a abusos antisemitas (ella es judía). «Una vez me arrojó un cuchillo nazi y estuvo a punto de darme en la cara», dice la denuncia. Aunque Smithline intentó dejar la relación, Warner la separó de su familia y la manipuló «hasta un estado de aislamiento casi total, lo que le permitió asumir el control total de su vida», según sus abogados. El abuso duró dos años y le ha creado un «trastorno de estrés postraumático complejo, con ansiedad, trastorno obsesivo compulsivo y ataques de pánico como resultado».

Esta nueva denuncia llega cuatro días después de que Manson, sobre quien pesa una orden de arresto por atacar a una fotógrafa en un concierto de 2019, llegara a un acuerdo con la policía para entregarse.
La primera mujer que denunció a Manson por hechos similares fue la actriz Evan Rachel Wood, que aseguró que el cantante «abusó horriblemente» de ella durante la relación que tuvieron de tres años, y que recibió varias amenazas para que no hiciera pública su historia «Estoy aquí para poner en evidencia a este hombre peligroso y llamar la atención a la industria del entretenimiento que le ha permitido hacer estas cosas, antes de que arruine más vidas. Estoy con las víctimas que ya no callarán». Las otras dos demandantes son la actriz Esmé Bianco y una antigua asistente del artista, Ashley Walters. Ésta última asegura que mientras trabajaba para él, le puso varias veces un vídeo de él abusando de una 'joven fan' menor de edad, a la que desnudaba y azotaba hasta hacerla llorar. En otro episodio violento, Walters se escondió de Warner en un armario, y éste derribó la puerta y la amenazó asegurando tener contactos de mafiosos que cometían asesinatos a sueldo. La demandante también asegura que él buscaba información en su ordenador para chantajearla, y que incluso le pirateó la cuenta de Facebook. Además, presuntamente se jactó ante ella de haber violado a mujeres impunemente.
Hay otras dos mujeres, Jane Doe y Sarah McNeilly, que no han puesto denuncia pero han revelado experiencias similares: «He tenido miedo de atraer la atención sobre mí para evitar terminar en su punto de mira de nuevo», dijo McNeilly en su perfil de Instagram. «Como resultado de la forma en que me trató, sufro problemas de salud mental y trastorno de estrés postraumático que han afectado a mis relaciones personales y profesionales, mi autoestima y mis metas personales. Creo que le gusta arruinar la vida de la gente. Quiero que Brian rinda cuentas por su maldad».
El propio Brian Warner se defendió de todas estas acusaciones con este comunicado: «Obviamente, mi arte y mi vida han sido durante mucho tiempo imanes de controversia, pero estas afirmaciones recientes sobre mí son horribles distorsiones de la realidad. Mis relaciones íntimas siempre han sido totalmente consensuadas con socios de ideas afines. Independientemente de cómo, y por qué, otros ahora eligen tergiversar el pasado, esa es la verdad».

Marilyn Manson está sendo acusado por assédio sexual pela modelo Ashley Morgan Smithline, com quem ele chegou a namorar por um tempo. Além dos abusos sexuais, ela também o acusa de abusos psicológicos e físicos.
Smithline contou que “convive com medo” e fez a denúncia para poder “seguir em frente” com sua vida.
“Tem sido importante para mim apresentar o que tenho feito porque vivo com medo constante até hoje. Estou buscando justiça porque quero seguir em frente e me curar do terrível abuso que enfrentei. Quero que Brian Warner (nome de batismo do cantor) seja responsabilizado de uma vez por todas”, disse à revista People.

Em uma das denúncias que a publicação teve acesso, a modelo chegou a sofrer vários cortes pelo corpo, inclusive, entrando em choque por conta da perda de sangue.
“Warner (Marilyn Manson) pegou uma faca ao lado da cama e começou a cortar o ombro, a parte interna do braço e o estômago da Sra. Smithline. Ainda segundo o documento, os cortes arrancaram sangue e fizeram com que a modelo entrasse em choque. Até hoje, a Sra. Smithline carrega as cicatrizes dos cortes do Sr. Warner”, dizia um trecho do documento, que ainda cita estupro, corte, chicotada, entre outras agressões.
No entanto, a defesa do artista diz que as acusações não tem fundamento.
“Há tantas falsidades em suas alegações que não saberíamos por onde começar a respondê-las. Esse relacionamento, até certo ponto era um relacionamento, durou menos de uma semana em 2010. Manson não viu a Sra. Smithline desde então”, disse.

Marilyn Manson e os problemas na Justiça
Vale lembrar que o artista tem uma “relação” com a Justiça, após tantas denúncias.
Em abril, a atriz Esme Bianco, conhecida por interpretar Ros na série Game of Thrones, também processou o cantor Marilyn Manson, com acusações parecidas com as de Ashley Morgan Smithline: estupro, agressão e de dopá-la com entorpecentes.
No documento, Esme contou que, em 2009, passou por uma sessão de tortura com um chicote que Marilyn afirmou ter sido usado por soldados nazistas. Após isso, ele ainda teria praticado os abusos sexuais.
A atriz revelou que o abuso ocorreu quando ela gravou o clipe de I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies.
É importante ressaltar que Manson foi investigado por supostamente ter cometido abuso contra sua ex-namorada, Evan Rachel Wood, após a atriz também acusá-lo de assédio em suas redes sociais.
Marilyn Manson se defende das acusações Além de Smithline, Esme Bianco e Evan Rachel Wood, outras mulheres foram à Justiça no início de 2021 para acusar Marilyn Manson de assédio sexual. Na época, o artista disse que todos os relacionamentos foram consensuais e que as acusações não procedem.",2021-07-01T15:00:00Z,https://www.ofuxico.com.br,OFuxico

La modelo Ashley Morgan Smithline presentó una demanda contra el cantante estadounidense Brian Warner, conocido como Marilyn Manson, por los abusos a los que la sometió durante su relación, según reveló este miércoles en el programa The View, de la cadena ABC.
Smithline, que en mayo se pronunció por primera vez sobre varios casos de presuntos asaltos, ha interpuesto una demanda por agresión sexual, trata de personas y encarcelamiento ilegal, entre otras acusaciones. Conforme a la modelo, durante los cerca de dos años de su relación sufrió múltiples abusos sexuales, físicos y psicológicos por parte de Manson.
En particular, Smithline afirma que el cantante la azotaba, le causó quemaduras y cortes, dejando una marca 'MM' permanente en su muslo. Asimismo, alega que la mantuvo en su apartamento, que estaba casi completamente a oscuras y con temperaturas bajas, manteniéndola despierta mediante cocaína, con la música alta y sin permitirle comer lo suficiente.
""Desde muy temprano, dejó claro que mi vida estaba definitivamente en peligro y que podía matarme en cualquier momento. Tuve miedo todo el tiempo de que acabara con mi vida"", aseveró la modelo y explicó que regresaba con el músico porque ""estaba extremadamente manipulada"".
En un comunicado presentado al programa, un portavoz de Manson descartó las acusaciones, afirmando que ""hay tantas falsedades en sus afirmaciones que no sabemos por dónde empezar a responderlas"". Asimismo, sostuvo que la relación entre los dos duró ""menos de una semana en 2010"", después de lo que Manson no habría visto a la denunciante.
Smithline es la cuarta mujer en acusar a Manson de agresión sexual.

Marilyn Manson Faces Fourth Sexual Assault Allegation,"Marilyn Manson's career seems more and more unsalvageable as a fourth woman has now come out against the singer for sexual assault and sexual battery claims. These claims, which are incredibly violent, are the fourth in a two-month-reckoning with the singer's alleged predatory past. The accuser, model Ashley Morgan Smithline, alleges that she and the singer started a consensual sexual relationship in 2010, though it quickly became violent within the first month.
According to TMZ, the singer became obsessed with the model in 2010 and began contacting her over social media. Later that year, Manson and his self-described ""perfect girl"" began a relationship, but the relationship quickly became violent and toxic. The model allegedly suffered injuries to her ribs and vagina after she awoke ""unconsciousness with her ankles and wrists tied together behind her back and [Manson] sexually penetrating her."" She claims she said no repeatedly, but the singer didn't stop.
That same month, things got even more brutal during a similar sexual encounter. After choking and slamming her, Smithline claims Manson ""grabbed a knife next to the bed and began cutting [her] shoulder, inner arm, and stomach,"" leaving permanent scars on her body. The couple continued their relationship until 2013, which Smithline alleges consisted of consistent threats to her life, physical abuse, anti-Semitic harassment, and poor living conditions. She is suing Manson for sexual assault, sexual battery, and intentional inflection of emotional distress and false improvement.
In response to Smithline's claims, Manson's team said ""We strongly deny Ms. Smithline’s claims. There are so many falsehoods within her claims that we wouldn’t know where to begin to answer them. This relationship, to the limited extent it was a relationship, lasted less than a week in 2010.""

Smithline conheceu Mason por meio das redes sociais em 2010. “Fui meio que bombardeada por mensagens no Facebook, e-mails, ligações de Skype, não sei se ele se lembrava de ter feito todas essas coisas diferentes”, contou ela no programa.
Ele então teria pedido para ela trabalhar como atriz em um projeto de filme que ele tinha. Ela foi à Califórnia, onde ele morava, para isso, mas ao chegar descobriu que o “estúdio” era o apartamento do cantor. Mesmo assim, os depois começaram uma relação consensual na sequência.
Na denúncia, ela relatou: “Rapidamente ficou claro que o sexo consensual não era suficiente para Warner [nome real de Manson]”. “Por volta de meados de novembro de 2010, a Sra. Smithline acordou inconsciente com os tornozelos e pulsos amarrados nas costas e o Sr. Warner a penetrando sexualmente”, diz o texto. “A Sra. Smithline disse que disse ao Sr. Warner para parar e disse não várias vezes, e o Sr. Warner disse a ela para ‘ficar quieta’.”
Na nova entrevista, Smithline disse que esse foi o primeiro abuso, mas que tudo piorou daquele ponto em diante. “Eu fui desumanizada, fui degradada, fui tratada como um animal”, afirmou. Ela diz ter sido chicoteada, queimada, cortada e marcada pelo namorado entre novembro de 2010 e janeiro de 2013.
A modelo contou que o cantor mantinha o apartamento no escuro total, fazendo com que ela perdesse a noção do tempo, e a mantinha acordada o tempo todo. Ela também disse que ele lhe dava cocaína e não a alimentava, fazendo com que o peso dela chegasse aos 36 kg.
Smithline também disse que não foi embora porque foi manipulada. “Por mais inseguro que fosse, eu simplesmente senti que não poderia escapar”, afirmou. Um porta-voz de Manson negou as alegações e disse que os dois tiveram um relacionamento que durou menos de uma semana, em 2010.
A modelo rebateu a declaração. “[Isso é] mais uma prova de que ele está negando qualquer responsabilidade, que ele não assume nenhuma responsabilidade por nada que tenha feito”, disse.
Antes de Smithline, outras três mulheres entraram com processos contra ele. São elas: a atriz Esmé Bianco, a ex-assistente pessoal Ashley Walters e uma mulher que permanece anônima. Além disso, ao todo 17 mulheres alegam que o cantor cometeu agressões sexuais contra elas, inclusive a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, de quem ele foi noivo.
O cantor está sendo investigado pela polícia de Los Angeles. Há um mandado de prisão emitido contra ele, mas por causa de uma agressão a um cinegrafista em 2019. O cantor disse na semana passada que vai se entregar, mas ainda não o fez.",2021-06-30T23:20:00Z,https://www.mixvale.com.br,Portal Mix Vale
Saksøkt av ekskjæreste,"En fjerde kvinne har nå gått til søksmål mot den omstridte rockestjerna Marilyn Manson (52), melder Rolling Stone.
Kvinnen det er snakk om er hans ekskjæreste, modellen Ashley Morgan Smithline (34), som tidligere i år sto fram med sin historie i magasinet People. Smithline omtalte da Manson som «et monster», og kom med en rekke anklagelser om voldtekt og annen mishandling.
En representant for Manson nektet den gang for at det var noe sannhet i Smithlines anklager, og slo tilbake med at relasjonen så vidt kunne kalles et forhold.
- Det er så mange feil rundt anklagene hennes at vi ikke vet hvor vi skal begynne. Dette forholdet, så langt en kan kalle det et forhold, varte ikke i ei uke engang, sa representanten den gang, ifølge magasinet.
Sterke anklager
Smithline har nå levert søksmål mot Manson. I søksmålet gjentar hun mye av det hun sto fram med i vår.
Marilyn Manson, hvis egentlige navn er Brian Warner, anklages blant annet for voldtekt, menneskehandel og diverse frihetsberøvelser.
Ifølge søksmålet skal Manson også ha forsøkt å kvele henne, kuttet henne opp med kniv, samt pisket og bitt henne gjentatte ganger.

Marilyn Manson accusé de viol : un nouveau témoignage glaçant,"MARILYN MANSON. La mannequin Ashley Morgan Smithline accuse Marilyn Manson de viol, traite d'humain et de séquestration.
[Mis à jour le 30 juin 2021 à 17h21] Contre Marilyn Manson, la liste des accusations s'allonge encore. Plusieurs mois après la déferlante d'allégations de violences sexuelles de plusieurs femmes, dont l'actrice Evan Rachel Wood, c'est au tour de la mannequin Ashley Morgan Smithline de livrer un témoignage glaçant, accusant le chanteur controversé de viol, traite d'humain et séquestration.
Dans sa plainte, relayée par le site Rolling Stone et qui fait suite à une interview vidéo accordée au site People, l'Américaine raconte avoir rencontré l'artiste en 2010. Ashley Morgan Smithline relate l'emprise qu'aurait eue Marilyn Manson sur elle dès le début de leur relation, qui était consentie dans un premier temps. Dans son entretien au site People, la mannequin racontait ""qu'elle s'est réveillée un jour d'un état d'inconscience, avec les poignets et les chevilles liés et que Warner (Brian Warner est le vrai nom de Marilyn Manson ndlr.) la pénétrait. Quand elle lui a dit d'arrêter, il lui a dit de ""la fermer."" Elle dit avoir été blessée aux côtes et au vagin. 'Il n'arrêtait pas de me dire : 'On ne peut pas violer une personne dont on est amoureux'."".
Dans sa plainte, Ashley Morgan Smithline affirme avoir été battue plusieurs fois par Marilyn Manson, qui lui aurait, selon son récit, gravé un ""MM"", toujours visible, sur la cuisse. Elle raconte avoir plusieurs fois voulu s'enfuir, mais que l'artiste la menaçait de la tuer si elle le faisait. ""Nous démentons fermement la plainte de madame Smithline"", répond l'artiste dans un communiqué transmis au site Rolling Stone ce 30 juin. Au total, une douzaine de femmes accusent Marilyn Manson de violences sexuelles.
Après le témoignage de l'actrice Evan Rachel Wood sur Instagram, accusant le chanteur de violences sexuelles, plusieurs autres femmes avaient déjà pris la parole en début d'année pour dénoncer des faits similaires. Evan Rachel Wood, connue notamment pour son rôle dans la série Westworld, dénonçait assure avoir été ""manipulée psychologiquement"" par Marilyn Manson quand elle avait 20 ans et soumise à d'horribles abus durant des années"".
Après son témoignage, largement relayé sur les réseaux sociaux, Ashley Walters, Gabriella, Ashley Lindsay Morgan et Sarah McNeilly ont à leur tour détaillé dans des communiqués leurs expériences et affirment avoir subi des ""agressions sexuelles, de maltraitances psychologiques ou de diverses formes de contraintes, de violences et d'intimidation"", peut-on lire dans les colonnes du site américain Vanity Fair. L'artiste controversé avait déjà fait l'objet d'accusations de la sorte dans le passé, accusations qu'il avait toujours nié.
Au lendemain de cette prise de parole, Marilyn Manson s'était finalement exprimé, lui aussi sur son compte Instagram. ""Évidemment, mon art et ma vie attirent depuis longtemps la controverse, mais ces récentes allégations contre moi sont d'horribles déformations de la réalité. Mes relations intimes ont toujours été entièrement consenties, avec des partenaires en accord. Peu importe comment et pourquoi d'autres choisissent aujourd'hui de déformer le passé, c'est la vérité"", écrivait-il dans un court texte.
A noter que son label Loma Vista Recordings, avec qui il avait sorti un dernier album en 2020, annonçait à la suite de ces allégations avoir cessé son travail avec le chanteur. ""À la lumière des allégations troublantes d'aujourd'hui de la part d'Evan Rachel Wood et d'autres femmes nommant Marilyn Manson comme leur agresseur, Loma Vista cessera de promouvoir son album actuel, avec effet immédiat. En raison de ces développements préoccupants, nous avons également décidé de ne pas travailler avec Marilyn Manson sur de futurs projets"", pouvait-on lire dans un communiqué publié début février 2021.
Une fois de plus, le séisme est venu des réseaux sociaux. Dans une publication postée sur Instagram le 1er février 2021, l'actrice Evan Rachel Wood accuse le chanteur Marylin Manson de violences sexuelles. ""Le nom de mon agresseur est Brian Warner, connu par le monde entier sous le nom de Marilyn Manson. Il a commencé par gagner ma confiance quand j'étais adolescente et m'a maltraitée durant des années. Il m'a lavé le cerveau et manipulée pour que je me soumette. Je veux dénoncer cet homme dangereux et les nombreuses industries qui l'ont laissé faire, avant qu'il ne ruine d'autres vies. Je suis aux côtés des nombreuses victimes qui ne seront plus silencieuses"", écrit la comédienne.
La vie privée de Marilyn Manson a souvent fait les choux gras de la presse à scandale outre-Atlantique. De 1997 à 2001, le chanteur fréquente l'actrice Rose McGowan, devenue aujourd'hui l'un des visages du féminisme et de la libération de la parole. En 2001, Marylin Manson s'affiche avec Dita von Teese, qu'il épouse en 2005, puis divorce en 2006.
C'est l'année suivante qu'il fait plusieurs apparitions publiques avec Evan Rachel Wood, alors âgée de 20 ans, qui apparaît d'ailleurs dans son clip Heart-Shaped. Le couple se sépare en 2010 après s'être fiancé. L'actrice dit avoir été soumise à ""d'horribles abus durant des années"". Sans nommer son bourreau, Evan Rachel Wood avait déjà témoigné en 2018 devant la Commission des affaires judiciaires de la Chambre des représentants, évoquant son long calvaire de victime d'abus psychologiques et physiques. Elle avait également affirmé avoir été violée à plusieurs reprises.
Après son histoire avec Evan Rachel Wood, Marilyn Manson fait la connaissance de Lindsay Usich, ancienne mannequin devenue photographe et peintre, de seize ans sa cadette. Ensemble depuis, ils se seraient mariés durant le confinement. Tous deux avaient d'ailleurs fait une apparition publique quelques semaines plus tôt sur le tapis rouge des Oscars en février 2020.
Marilyn Manson, de son vrai nom Brian Hugh Warner, est né le 5 janvier 1969 à Canton aux Etats-Unis. Scolarisé dans un établissement épiscopalien, Brian Warner se passionne très tôt pour le rock et devient fan d'AC/DC et de Kiss. A dix-huit ans, il déménage en Floride et entreprend des études de journalisme et de théâtre. En 1989, il décide de former un groupe avec le guitariste Scott Putesky et prend son nom de scène, Marilyn Manson, en référence à Marilyn Monroe et au tueur en série Charles Manson. Le groupe, qui se baptise Marilyn Manson & The Spooky Kids, se construit dans le refus de l'Amérique puritaine. Sa musique est classée dans le rock alternatif.
En 1992, le groupe se rebaptise Marilyn Manson. Son premier album, Portrait of an American Family, sort en 1994. Viennent ensuite Smells Like Children en 1995, Antichrist Superstar en 1996, Mechanical Animals en 1998, Holy Wood en 2000, The Golden Age of Grotesque en 2003, Eat Me, Drink Me en 2007, The High End of Low en 2009, Born Villain en 2012, The Pale Emperor en 2015, Heaven Upside Down en 2017 et enfin, WE ARE CHAOS en 2020.

Marilyn Manson Accuser Ashley Morgan Smithline on 'The View': Watch,"“There are so many falsehoods within her claims that we wouldn’t know where to begin to answer them,” the statement continued. “This relationship, to the limited extent it was a relationship, lasted less than a week in 2010. Manson hasn’t seen Ms. Smithline since then.”
Ellwanger also responded to the statement, telling The View hosts, “It’s one thing to issue a statement to the media and it’s another thing to respond to a lawsuit. And we’ll look forward to seeing what the evidence shows in this case, and the evidence will back up the claims made in the complaint.”
Earlier in the interview, Smithline told the co-hosts that Manson’s abuse, which she says involved rape and emotional manipulation, made her “absolutely” fear for her life.
“Very early on, he made it clear that my life was definitely in danger and that he could kill me at any time,” she said. “I was afraid all the time that he would end my life.”
The model shared that she “was extremely manipulated” and “coerced into being with him in the first place,” leaving her feeling as if she “couldn’t escape it.” She also shared, while visibly shaken, one of her first abusive experiences with the singer, in which she woke up “bound” as he penetrated her unconscious body.
When asked about why she had waited to come forward, Smithline pointed to a culture that blames women for what their attackers do. “Are we blaming women for wearing short skirts and having a drink at a party?” she questioned. “I think that that’s the problem. That we’re focusing on like, ‘They should have known better.'”
Ellwanger went on to say that, “I think for survivors like Ashley, it’s important for the viewers to remember that there are only two avenues where they can seek justice. One is the criminal justice system, and Ashley has done that she has spoken to the district attorney in Los Angeles.
“She has spoken to detectives, she has provided evidence, and at this point, it’s out of her hands as to what decisions the district attorney in L.A. decides to do,” he continued. “But when it comes to the civil justice system, that is where a survivor like Ashley can take control of the narrative and to change the timeline into one that they are able to dictate.”",2021-06-30T04:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Marilyn Manson entrega-se à polícia devido a acusação de agressão,"O músico Marilyn Manson entregou-se à polícia de Los Angeles, após ter sido emitido um mandato de prisão pela polícia de Gilford, no estado do nordeste norte-americano de New Hampshire. A motivar a decisão do tribunal estão duas acusações de delito contra o músico.
Marilyn Manson é acusado de num concerto em New Hampshire, em 2019, agredir e cuspir um videógrafo - profissional acreditado, que se encontrava entre os restantes fotógrafos presentes no local.
Caso seja considerado culpado, Marilyn Manson arrisca pena de prisão de um ano e uma multa de dois mil dólares - 1700 euros.
O músico, cujo verdadeiro nome é Brian Hugh Warner, vai entregar-se ao Departamento de Polícia de Los Angeles no âmbito de um acordo de rendição promovido entre os seus advogados e os oficias de New Hampshire.
Esta está longe de ser a única polémica com contornos judiciais a envolver o nome de Marilyn Manson. Recentemente foi acusado de vários crimes sexuais relacionados com abusos e violações. Evan Rachel Wood, sua ex-namorada, foi uma das mulheres a quebrar o silêncio sobre o comportamento violento do músico.

Marilyn Manson gaat zichzelf aangeven,"Marilyn Manson staat op het punt zichzelf aan te geven bij de autoriteiten in Californië vanwege een uitstaande arrestatie uit 2019, waarbij hij een videojournalist zou hebben aangevallen tijdens een concert in New Hampshire. Dit meldt Page Six.
De 52-jarige zanger, wiens eigenlijke naam Brian Warner is, zou een overeenkomst hebben gesloten met de lokale politie om ergens deze zomer voor de rechtbank te verschijnen voor zijn vergrijp. Manson zou meerdere malen op de camera van de journalist gespuugd hebben tijdens zijn optreden, wat tegen de regels van de organisatie in ging.
Mocht de zanger veroordeeld worden voor zijn vergrijp, dan kan hij een paar maanden vast komen te zitten en moet hij een boete van 1700 euro betalen.
Manson lag de afgelopen maanden sowieso al onder vuur, nadat meerdere vrouwen hem aanklaagden voor seksueel misbruik, waaronder actrices Evan Rachel Wood en Esmé Bianco. Zij claimen dat de zanger hen tegen hun wil in misbruikte, vernederde en volledig manipuleerde. Als gevolg daarvan zette onder meer Mansons platenmaatschappij en management hem aan de kant.
Vooralsnog houdt de zanger vol onschuldig te zijn.",2021-06-28T01:56:23Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen
Marilyn Manson Expected To Surrender To LAPD On Assault Charges: Report,"Marilyn Manson is expected to turn himself for outstanding warrants, the LAPD said. The musician is facing two counts of Class A Misdemeanor Simple Assault that are the result of incidents that happened in Gilford, New Hampshire. The warrants were initially drafted by the Gilford Police Department in New Hampshire, but have been transferred to Los Angeles. These alleged assaults are just one of many that Manson is being accused of.
The initial incident that involves the allegations surrounding Marilyn Manson took place on August 18th, 2019. Manson was performing at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavillion when the attacks allegedly took place. According to accounts from local law enforcement, a videographer who was working at the concert claims that they were spat on during a segment of the concert where Manson incited a mosh pit.
While speaking with USA Today, Manson's lawyer, Howard King, says that Manson and his team have known about the warrants for a while.""It is no secret to anyone who has attended a Marilyn Manson concert that he likes to be provocative on stage, especially in front of a camera,"" King declared. ""This misdemeanor claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm. After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply.""

Though Marilyn Manson is expected to turn himself in, his court date will be arranged by the Gilford Police Department in New Hampshire. The Gilford Chief of Police, Tony Burpee, has also spoken with USA Today. ""If Mr. Warner turns himself in within the next few weeks, his initial appearance/arraignment will likely be scheduled for mid-August,"" Burpee stated to the publication.
The embattled musician continues to face the law as more allegations pile up against him. Not only does Manson have the physical assault charges from New Hampshire, but he's also been accused of sexual assault, as well. Earlier this year, actresses Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco have accused him of sexual assault. His other reported victims include his former assistant, Ashley Walters, and famed adult film actress Jenna Jameson.

Marilyn Manson si consegnerà alla polizia a Los Angeles,"LOS ANGELES - Pare che Marilyn Manson abbia deciso di consegnarsi alla polizia di Los Angeles in seguito al caso di un'aggressione decisamente non convenzionale, avvenuta nel 2019 a una camerawoman nel New Hampshire.
Ne dà notizia il portale Variety citando un post social del capo della polizia di Gilford, New Hampshire: «Grazie a oltre 300'000 commenti e condivisioni, alla fine il signor Warren (vero cognome di Manson, ndr.) ha dovuto per forza di cose confrontarsi con il mandato di arresto nei suoi confronti. Speriamo che la vittima possa avere la giusta soddisfazione in una corte di giustizia».
Il cantante, lo ricordiamo, aveva sputato (anche se ""scatarrato"" sarebbe più appropriato) addosso a una tecnica video che era stata incaricata di filmare il concerto a Gilford nel 2019. Il mandato era poi stata pubblicato sui social il 25 maggio.

Politiet sier at Marilyn Manson vil melde seg til dem
Artisten skal ha gått med på å møte opp hos politiet på bakgrunn av anklager om å ha spyttet og snytt seg på en videofotograf.
Av Thomas Talseth
Publisert: For mindre enn 10 minutter siden
Ifølge en rekke amerikanske medier sier en politisjef i New Hampshire at en avtale er inngått mellom dem og Marilyn Mansons advokat, om at artisten skal melde seg.
Årsaken er at politiet har siktet Manson (52), hvis egentlige navn er Brian Hugh Warner, for overfall mot en videofotograf som befant seg i fotograven under en konsert med artisten i New Hampshire-byen Gilford 18. august 2019.
Manson skal ha snytt seg og spyttet på den kvinnelige fotografen.
Ifølge CNN forteller Gilford-politisjef Anthony Bean Burpee at strafferammen er på opptil ett års fengsel og bot på opptil 17.000 kroner.
Ikke seksuell karakter
Burpee sier til Variety at han mener Gilford-politiets Facebook-innlegg fra 26. mai i år om siktelsen har «tvunget Herr Warner til endelig å imøtekomme sin NH-arrestordre».
– Mange rakker ned på vårt byrå for i det hele tatt å ta ut siktelse, sier politisjefen.

Innlegget understreker at anklagene mot Manson i denne saken ikke er av seksuell karakter, og oppgir at det påpekes fordi flere medier skal ha spurt politiet om dette.
De ovennevnte medier har forsøkt å få Mansons advokat i tale, uten hell.
Manson er fra før under etterforskning av føderale myndigheter. «Game Of Thrones»-skuespiller Esmé Bianco (39) har saksøkt ham for seksuell-, fysisk og emosjonell mishandling i en periode fra 2009 og 2011.
Bianco hevder blant annet at hun skal ha blitt holdt innelåst og at hun skal ha blitt truet og tvunget til å ha sex.
Mansons advokat har sagt at de vil bestride påstandene ettertrykkelig i retten.
Droppet av partnere
Artistens tidligere forlovede, skuespiller Evan Rachel Wood (33), gikk i januar ut med anklager om vold og seksuelle overgrep begått av ekskjæresten.
I mai ble det kjent at Mansons tidligere assistent har saksøkt ham for trakassering og for å ha forgrepet seg på henne seksuelt.
De siste månedene har Mansons manager, bookingbyrå og plateselskap droppet sine samarbeid med ham.
Ifølge Variety sier Gilford-politisjefen at de nå vil oversende arrestordren til politiet i Los Angeles, som deretter vil avtale med Mansons advokat om når artisten skal melde seg.
Dersom dette skjer i løpet av de nærmeste ukene, vil Mansons første rettsmøte i New Hampshire antagelig finne sted i midten av august.
Vitner sier han lo
Ifølge People har Mansons advokat Howard King tidligere uttalt at fotografen krevde rundt 300.000 kroner av artistens apparat etter konserten i New Hampshire – og at anmeldelsen til politiet kom i etterkant av at Manson-leiren ba om bevis for påstått skade.
Dette ble i sin tur avfeid av politisjef Burpee, som påpekte at anmeldesen kom dagen etter konserten.
People skriver videre at de snakket med tre vitner som var tilstede på konserten, hvorav en var sikkerhetsvakt.
De skal alle ha bekreftet at Manson gikk tett opptil fotografen og snøt seg på henne, etter først å ha truffet kameraet hennes med spytt mer tilfeldig.
To av dem sier også at han lo mens fotografen forlot området like etterpå.",2021-06-26T19:11:05Z,https://www.vg.no,VG

(NEXSTAR) – Rock musician Marilyn Manson is expected to turn himself in to the Los Angeles police on assault charges stemming from an alleged incident from 2019, according to the police chief of Gilford, New Hampshire.
An in-house prosecutor with the Gilford Police Department has reached a deal with attorneys for Manson — born Brian Hugh Warner — after the Gilford Police Department shared news of their active arrest warrant for Manson on Facebook last month. In the post, the police department said Manson was charged with two counts of simple assault on a videographer. The alleged incident took place at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion on August 18, 2019, according to police.
“Mr. Warner, his agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the pending charges,” police wrote in the Facebook post.
Gilford Police now say a copy of the warrant is being sent to the LAPD, who will then contact Manson’s attorneys to arrange for a time that he will turn himself in. After the booking and bail processes, Manson will be given a date for a court appearance in New Hampshire. If he turns himself in within the next “few weeks,” that court date will likely be scheduled for mid-August, Gilford Police confirmed in an emailed statement.
Each misdemeanor count can carry penalties of a possible one-year jail sentence and fines of up to $2,000.
Police also noted that Manson’s alleged assaults are “not sexual” in nature.
In a statement shared with People, one of Manson’s attorneys has claimed that the alleged victim had only filed a police report after Manson refused to pay $35,000 for damages to video equipment. King also claimed that the incident may have involved a “small amount” of Manson’s spit which came into contact with the videographer’s arm.
“This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout,” said attorney Howard King.
Gilford Police Chief Anthony Bean Burpee, however, claims that reports of the videographer asking for a “payout” are false, as the police report was filed “the day after” the alleged incident.
As of Saturday, Chief Burpee said Manson’s attorney in New Hampshire is still coordinating with his L.A. attorney and publicist on the details of reporting to the LAPD.
In 2020, Manson had also been accused of sexual, physical and emotional abuse by over a dozen women including actresses Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco, the Huffington Post reported at the time. He has denied all allegations.",2021-06-26T18:14:00Z,https://www.abc4.com,ABC 4

Cops: Marilyn Manson to Turn Himself In on Assault Charges,"(Newser) – For more than a year and a half, an arrest warrant has been out for Marilyn Manson on the East Coast. Now, the rocker says he's going to turn himself in. Anthony Bean Burpee, the police chief of Gilford, NH, said in a Friday statement that Manson (real name Brian Warner) will present himself to the Los Angeles Police Department regarding an October 2019 warrant that accuses Manson of assaulting a videographer at his August 2019 concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion, reports the Los Angeles Times. People notes that a date has not yet been set for when Manson will arrive at the LAPD, with details to be worked out between the police department and Manson's legal team, per Burpee. The warrant for two misdemeanor counts of simple assault came about after Manson allegedly spit and hurled snot at the videographer, who was filming the concert from the stage pit area.

""He was spitting everywhere and one time it got on her camera, so she wiped it off and looked semi-irritated,"" one witness tells People. ""He got on the floor, got within 2 [to] 3 feet of her, and hacked a giant snot rocket at her, not the camera."" Manson attorney Howard King says in a statement that the charges are ""ludicrous"" and that the videographer tried to get $35,000 out of Manson after ""a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm."" King says his client never heard from her again after evidence was requested. Burpee calls King's remarks ""emphatically false"" and says the videographer reported the alleged crime the day after the concert. Manson's first court appearance in the Granite State would likely be in mid-August if he turns himself in within the next few weeks, Burpee notes, adding that, if convicted, Manson could face up to one year behind bars and a maximum fine of $2,000. The singer is already under criminal investigation for domestic violence allegations. (Read more Marilyn Manson stories.)",2021-06-26T16:00:00Z,https://www.newser.com,Newser
Marilyn Manson vai se entregar à polícia sob suspeita de agressão,"Quando se entregar, segundo o jornal Metro, o cantor será transferido para New Hampshire, onde deve ser julgado
São Paulo, SP
Marilyn Manson, 52, concordou em se entregar à polícia de Los Angeles (Califórnia) um mês depois de ter mandado de prisão expedido. O pedido de detenção do cantor envolve duas acusações de agressões ocorridas em 2019, em New Hampshire (EUA). Anthony Bean Burpee, chefe de polícia de Gilford, afirmou que houve um acordo entre as autoridades de New Hampshire e o advogado de Manson, segundo a CNN, para que o artista se apresentasse à política -a data não foi informada.
Quando se entregar, segundo o jornal Metro, o cantor será transferido para New Hampshire, onde deve ser julgado -a primeira sessão do processo no tribunal deve ser em agosto. Marilyn Manson, cujo nome é Brian Hugh Warner, enfrenta duas acusações de contravenção por supostamente agredir um cinegrafista.
De acordo com a CNN, o cinegrafista, contratado por uma empresa com sede em New Hampshire, estava localizado na área do fosso do palco quando os supostos ataques ocorreram -Manson teria cuspido no profissional.
O show aconteceu em 18 de agosto de 2019. O mandado de prisão foi emitido em 8 de outubro de 2019, mas só se tornou público em 25 de maio deste ano após comunicado publicado pela Polícia de Gilford em sua página oficial no Facebook.
“Sr. Warner, seu agente e advogado estão cientes do mandado há algum tempo e nenhum esforço foi feito por eles para retornar a New Hampshire e responder às acusações pendentes”, dizia a publicação que se refere ao cantor pelo seu nome verdadeiro, Brian Warner.
Após o comunicado da polícia, o advogado de Manson, Howard King, disse à NBC News que a acusação era “ridícula”, mas que eles estavam comprometidos em cooperar com as autoridades. “Não é segredo para ninguém que assistiu a um show do Marilyn Manson que ele gosta de ser provocador no palco, especialmente na frente de uma câmera.”
O representante do cantor disse ainda que a acusação surgiu após um cinegrafista procurá-los pedindo “mais de US$ 35 mil [R$ 185 mil]” por causa da situação. Ele completou que, após terem solicitado provas de que Manson teria cuspido nele, o cinegrafista não respondeu mais. De acordo com a polícia, Manson pode ser condenado a uma sentença de menos de um ano na prisão e a uma multa de US$ 2.000 (R$ 10 mil) ou menos.

Abuso e agressão sexual
Além do mandado expedido por acusações de agressão, Marilyn Manson teve seu nome envolvido, ao longo dos últimos meses, em denúncias de ex-namoradas e outras mulheres de assédio e estupro.
Em maio passado, uma ex-namorada de Manson, identificada como Jane Doe, acusa o cantor de estupro e por ter lhe forçado a assistir um vídeo caseiro que mostra ele abusando de uma jovem fã, segundo a People. Ela diz que namorou o roqueiro em 2011 e que o relacionamento começou sendo “romântico e gentil” antes de “rapidamente mudar de rumo para pior”, diz o site TMZ.
Segundo a revista People, a mulher disse que o cantor lhe mostrou uma fita de vídeo dele mesmo supostamente abusando de uma jovem, amarrando-a a uma cadeira, fazendo-a beber o que parecia ser urina e ameaçando-a com uma arma.
Ela afirma que passou a temer por sua vida após ver as imagens e que o sexo com o roqueiro se tornou cada vez mais violento, com ele agarrando-a com “extrema força”. Ele teria ainda forçado ela a fazer sexo oral após recusar avanços do músico.
CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE
Disse ainda que, quando tentou devolver as chaves da casa de Manson, foi estuprada e ameaçada de morte pelo cantor, com ele dizendo que se safaria se a matasse. Ela alega ainda que “reprimiu” essas lembranças até ouvir sobre outras as acusações contra ele, em fevereiro deste ano.
Em fevereiro de 2021, a ex-noiva do cantor Evan Rachel Wood, 33, disse que ele começou a assediá-la quando ela ainda era adolescente. “Ele abusou terrivelmente de mim por anos”, afirmou a atriz. Segundo a Vanity Fair, além da atriz, outras quatro mulheres que afirmam ter tido relações afetivas com o cantor também acusaram o artista de manipulação, assédio e abusos. Uma delas, que esteve com Marilyn Manson em 2015 também menciona vários estupros. Também acusaram Manson sua ex-assistente Ashley Walters e a atriz Esmé Bianco, de “Game of Thrones”.
Sobre as acusações de abuso sexual, Manson se posicionou em suas redes sociais no início de fevereiro. “Obviamente minha arte e minha vida sempre foram ímãs para polêmica, mas essas afirmações recentes sobre mim são horríveis distorções da realidade”, escreveu em seu Instagram. “Meus relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram totalmente consensuais com companheiras que pensam como eu. Independentemente de como, e por quê, outras estão optando hoje por manipular o passado, esta é a verdade”, completou o artista.

Marilyn Manson Will Turn Himself in to Police for Assault,"Photo: Getty Images
CNN reported on Friday that Marilyn Manson will turn himself in to the police to face assault charges from a 2019 incident in Gilford, New Hampshire, after an active arrest warrant was put out for the performer in May of 2021. Manson will turn himself in to the Los Angeles Police Department, although the Gilford Police Chief said that no date has been set for his surrender. (Side note: are celebrities just allowed to decide when they want to turn themselves in when they’re under arrest?) According to the Gilford Police Department statement from May, Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, faces “two counts of Class A misdemeanor Simple Assault stemming from a 2019 incident at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion” in which he allegedly assaulted a videographer at the venue. This case is unrelated to multiple ongoing accusations and lawsuits accusing Manson of sexual assault and psychological abuse of multiple women.",2021-06-26T15:04:47Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
Marilyn Manson to Surrender in LA.. on New Hampshire Assault Charge,"Marilyn Manson will surrender to the Los Angeles Police Department for allegedly assaulting a videographer during a 2019 New Hampshire concert, Gilford, N.H. police chief Anthony Bean Burpee confirmed to Variety.
“Thanks to over 300,000 FB comments and shares (many besmirching our agency for even filing such charges), it has forced Mr. Warner to finally address his outstanding NH warrant, which will, in turn, allow the victim of the crime to have her say/day in Court in order to hopefully hold Mr. Warner accountable for his actions,” Burpee said in a statement.
Manson’s arrest warrant was first issued in Oct 8. 2019 following the Aug. 18, 2019 incident at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion where he allegedly spat on the videographer, who had been subcontracted by a New Hampshire-based company to video the concert. The Gilford Police Department then made the warrant public on Facebook on May 25, citing two counts of Class A misdemeanor simple assault. The warrant also noted that the alleged assaults are not sexual in nature.
Burpee said Gilford’s prosecutor is working toward sending the warrant to an LAPD detective, who will then contact Manson’s Los Angeles-based attorney to arrange for a time to turn himself in. If this happens in the next few weeks, Manson’s initial New Hampshire court appearance will likely be mid-August. He added that if the videographer is looking to pursue a civil suit, it will run separately from the criminal investigation. Manson’s lawyer did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for comment.
Manson also faces a federal lawsuit accusing him of sexual assault and battery and violating the federal anti-trafficking law, which was filed by actress Esmé Bianco. Official action against Manson came after multiple women came forward in February, including Bianco and Evan Rachel Wood, about allegedly enduring psychological and sexual abuse by Manson. Manson has denied the allegations, but was dropped by his manager, agency and record label following the accusations.",2021-06-26T13:49:44Z,https://variety.com,Variety

Marilyn Manson to turn himself in to police over alleged assault charges,"M arilyn Manson is reportedly set to turn himself into police for an active arrest warrant issued in October 2019.
The musician - real name Brian Warner - has been wanted on two counts of simple assault after he was accused by a female videographer of assaulting her with his ‘snot’, during an August 2019 performance in Gilford, New Hampshire.
According to Gilford police, Mr Manson’s lawyers have agreed for the star to turn himself in on the warrant in Los Angeles.
Gilford police chief Anthony Bean Burpee said the rocker should now report to the Los Angeles Police Department and would be given a court date across the country in New Hampshire.
If the 52-year-old does turn himself into the Los Angeles Police Department, an arraignment could be scheduled for as early as mid-August.
The incident occurred during Mr Manson’s Hell Never Dies tour with Rob Zombie at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in August 2019.
A female videographer, who had been subcontracted to record the concert, claimed that during the show the singer decided to ‘shoot his snot’ at her.
The incident was later supported by fellow concertgoers who were nearby in the stage pit area.
Gilford Police had issued two arrest warrants and it was made public in May.
In a Facebook post from Gilford Police Department, they said: “The Gilford Police Department has an active arrest warrant for Brian Hugh Warner (aka: Marilyn Manson) for two counts of Class A misdemeanour Simple Assault stemming from a 2019 incident at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion. The alleged assaults involved a videographer.
“Mr Warner, his agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the pending charges.”
Mr Burpee said he believes sharing the warrant on Facebook put pressure on Mr Manson to answer the case.
This is not the only legal trouble Mr Manson is facing.

Marilyn Manson will surrender to Los Angeles authorities on an active arrest warrant for allegedly assaulting a videographer in New Hampshire.
The Los Angeles Times reported that Gilford Police Chief Anthony Bean Burpee said Manson, who was born Brian Hugh Warner, would turn himself in to the Los Angeles Police Department following an arrest warrant issued on October 8, 2019.
The arrest warrant, which Gilford authorities made public in May 2021, charges Manson, 52, with ""two counts of Class A Misdemeanor Simple Assault stemming from a 2019 incident at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion,"" an outdoor amphitheater in Gilford.
The LA Times reported that a videographer contracted to film Manson's concert was in the stage pit when she was allegedly assaulted. The report, which specified that the incident was not sexual, also said the videographer alerted authorities of the alleged assault the day after the concert. Still, the investigation took several months to complete.
When the arrest warrant was first made public, the Gilford Police Department said in a Facebook post that ""Mr. Warner, his Agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the pending charges.""
The post specified that a ""Class A misdemeanor in NH can carry a possible jail sentence of less than one year and a fine of $2,000.00 or less.""
Manson will surrender to the LAPD as part of an agreement between New Hampshire officials and Manson's attorney, the LA Times reported. Burpee said if Manson surrenders within the next few weeks, his initial court appearance in New Hampshire could happen by mid-August.
Representatives for Manson and the Gilford Police Department did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
The agreement comes after Manson has faced multiple allegations of sexual assault.
In a February Instagram post, actress Evan Rachel Wood shared details of alleged sexual abuse she experienced during her relationship with Manson, who she was engaged to in 2010. They began dating in 2007 when Wood was 19 and Manson was 38 years old.
Wood accused Manson of ""grooming"" her as a teenager and ""horrifically"" abusing her.
""Game of Thrones"" actress Esmé Bianco came out a month later with a lawsuit against Manson and his former manager. Bianco accused Manson of sexual assault and battery.
In May, Manson's former assistant filed a lawsuit against him and alleged that he sexually assaulted, battered, and harassed her.
In a statement shared to Instagram in February, Manson denied Wood's allegations.
""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,"" wrote Manson. ""My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""",2021-06-26T04:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER

An attorney for Manson agreed to let him turn himself in to the Los Angeles Police Detective to be booked and released on bail, Gilford police announced Friday. A condition of his bail will be having no contact with the alleged victim.
It's not clear when Manson will turn himself in to face the two class A misdemeanors, which police have said can carry a jail sentence of under a year and a fine of $2,000 or less in New Hampshire.
Because of a pandemic-related backlog in court, the case may not have its next hearing until 2022, according to police.
Police in Gilford, New Hampshire, have issued an arrest warrant for Marilyn Manson.
A representative for the singer offered no comment when reached Friday. Manson's attorney, Howard King, said in May, after police posted on Facebook about the arrest warrant, that he and his client were cooperating with investigators.
""It is no secret to anyone who has attended a Marilyn Manson concert that he likes to be provocative on stage, especially in front of a camera. This misdemeanor claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm. After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply,"" King said in a statement to NBC10 Boston. ""This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout.""

Police on Friday disputed that the person who reported the crime did so looking for a payout, noting that it took months for police to establish the facts necessary to apply for the arrest warrant.
""The victim reported the alleged crime to us the day after she had been assaulted, which is contrary to a statement Mr. Warner’s LA-based attorney made regarding the fact the victim had been looking for a $30k payout and when turned down proceeded with filing a police report. That is emphatically false,"" Deputy police Chief Kristian Kelley wrote in a statement.
Police have previously said that the person assaulted was a videographer working for a local company who was in the concert venue's stage pit when the incident took place.
The Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion is an amphitheater that seats about 8,000 people. Manson played a show there with Rob Zombie and Twins Of Evil on Aug. 18, 2019, according to prior concert listings.
Marilyn Manson was dropped by his record label, Loma Vista Recordings, after Evan Rachel Wood accused the singer of ""horrifically abusing"" her ""for years.""
Police in Gilford have noted that the assault allegations are not sexual in nature, explaining that multiple media outlets had asked due to unrelated allegations against the singer.
Manson has recently been accused of abuse by several women, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has confirmed it is investigating him over alleged domestic violence. A representative of the singer's has previously denied any accusations of assault to NBC News.",2021-06-25T15:42:05Z,https://www.nbcboston.com,NBC10 Boston
"Marilyn Manson, wanted for assault in New Hampshire, reaches agreement to turn himself in","Manson, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, reached an agreement with the Gilford, N.H., police department’s in-house prosecutor to turn himself in on the warrant in Los Angeles, Chief Anthony J. Bean Burpee said in an e-mail. The department had previously been in a “holding pattern” while Manson’s attorney in New Hampshire coordinated with his attorney and publicist in LA, Burpee said.

The prosecutor has spoken to a Los Angeles Police Department detective to walk him through the procedure for when Manson turns himself in, Burpee said. Once Manson turns himself in at a pre-arranged time, he will go through LAPD’s booking and bail process before receiving a court date in New Hampshire.
“What this all means for us is that ... it has forced Mr. Warner to finally address his outstanding NH warrant, which will, in turn, allow the victim of the crime to have her say/day in Court in order to hopefully hold Mr. Warner accountable for his actions,” Burpee wrote.
Burpee told the Globe in May that the charges are based on state law that considers “unprivileged physical contact to another” as a simple assault punishable by a maximum of a $2,000 fine or less than a year in jail. The videographer at Manson’s Aug. 18, 2019 concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion reported to police the next day that she had been spit on by the performer, according to Burpee.
Manson’s attorney, Howard King, called the allegations “ludicrous” in an e-mail seeking comment on the charges when they were publicized by police last month.

“It is no secret to anyone who has attended a Marilyn Manson concert that he likes to be provocative on stage, especially in front of a camera,” King told the Globe in May. “This misdemeanor claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm. After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply.”
The assault charges are not sexual in nature, police have said. Manson has been accused of sexual assault by numerous women, including actors Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco.

Marilyn Manson sigue acumulando denuncias en su contra, pues este viernes una ex pareja demandó al cantante en la Corte Superior del Condado de Los Ángeles por violación y abuso.
De acuerdo con los documentos obtenidos por el portal E! News, una mujer que se identificó como “Jane Doe” en el documento, alegó que ella y Brian Warner, nombre verdadero del músico, comenzaron una relación tras haberse conocido en una fiesta de los Grammys en 2011.
En este también describe que la relación comenzó con el consenso de ambos, pero con el tiempo el intérprete se volvió controlador y abusivo. El documento describió que Manson retenía la comida, exigía que estuviera desnuda y la castigaba si no respondía sus llamadas.
La presunta víctima explicó que Manson comenzó a exhibir comportamientos sexuales agresivos y a exigirle sexo a todas horas de la noche. También dijo que la obligó a practicarle sexo oral y en otro incidente. También afirmó que Manson la empujó al suelo y la violó, tras el ataque, ella afirmó que el intérprete dijo que podría matarla y “salirse con la suya”.

La demanda agregó que Manson le mostró un video a la mujer en donde se muestra a una adolescente siendo abusada por Manson y sus compañeros de banda. En la grabación el cantante supuestamente obligó a la joven a beber orina, fue atada a una silla y amenazó su vida, por lo que el documento señala que le preocupaba que la joven siguiera viva.
Una fuente cercana a Manson le dijo a NBC News que el video descrito estaba escrito. Un representante del equipo de Manson negó rotundamente las acusaciones de la mujer.
“La actriz de la película era una adulta que también había aparecido en un video musical anterior llamado ‘The Long Hard Road Out of Hell’. El cortometraje con guión estaba destinado a ser un video adicional para el lanzamiento de un próximo álbum, pero nunca se lanzó”, declaró.
Esta acusación se sumó a la orden de arresto emitida por el departamento de policía dentro de New Hampshire por agredir a una camarógrafa en 2019.

Este martes en un comunicado en su cuenta de Facebook, el Departamento de Policía de Gilford anunció que tiene una orden de arresto activa para el hombre de 52 años por dos cargos de delito menor de asalto simple que involucra un presunto incidente con una camarógrafa en el pabellón de Bank of New Hampshire. Según este, todo sucedió en un concierto el 19 de agosto del 2019.
De acuerdo con el oficio, el cantante tiene conocimiento de la orden de arresto desde hace un tiempo, pero no ha hecho ningún esfuerzo para responder.
“El Sr. Warner, su agente y asesor legal están al tanto de la orden desde hace algún tiempo y no ha hecho ningún esfuerzo por regresar a New Hampshire para responder a los cargos pendientes. El camarógrafo había sido subcontratado por una empresa con sede en NH para grabar el concierto y estaba ubicado en el área del foso del escenario cuando ocurrieron los presuntos asaltos”, explicó el departamento.
La revista People entrevistó a dos asistentes de dicho concierto, así como a un guardia de seguridad, quienes expresaron que vieron al intérprete escupir y lanzar sus mocos contra la mujer, mientras ella estaba trabajando.

“Él estaba escupiendo por todas partes y una vez apareció en su cámara, así que ella se limpió y se veía irritada. Él se dio cuenta de esto y siguió escupiendo a propósito en su cámara. Creo que su última gota es que él se tiró al suelo, se puso a 2 o 3 pies (menos de un metro) de ella y le lanzó un cohete de mocos gigante, no a la cámara. Ella estaba enojada y disgustada, así que se marchó furiosa y él se rió”, contó una asistente.

Marilyn Manson Accused of Rape and Sexual Abuse in New Lawsuit,"Marilyn Manson is the target of a new lawsuit, according to documents acquired by E! News.
A former partner of the singer, whose real name is Brian Warner, accused him of rape and abuse in a lawsuit filed Friday in the Los Angeles County Superior Court.
Download our mobile app for iOS or Android to get alerts for local breaking news and weather.
The woman, who remains anonymous and is known as ""Jane Doe"" in the filing, claims that she and Manson began a relationship after meeting at a pre-Grammys party in 2011. Though the relationship began as consensual, Doe alleges that over time, Manson exhibited controlling behavior, such as withholding food, demanding she be nude at nearly all times in his apartment and punishing her in unspecified ways if she did not answer his calls and texts immediately.
Doe alleges that Manson later began exhibiting aggressive sexual behaviors, such as demanding sex from her at all hours of the night. She alleges he forced her to perform oral sex on him. In a separate incident, Doe claims that Manson pushed her to the ground and raped her. Doe claims that Manson said he would be able to ""get away"" with killing her if he wished to following the assault.

The lawsuit also alleges that Manson showed Doe a video of what appeared to be a young teenager being abused by Manson and his bandmates. In the video, Manson allegedly forces the girl to drink a cup of his bandmate's urine, ties her to a chair and threatens her life. Doe alleged that she was concerned that Manson had killed the girl, whose identity she was not able to verify. Manson said the movie was just ""acting,"" however, Doe alleged that Manson also said he had shown the recording to his manager Tony Ciulla, who demanded Manson lock the video in a safe and not show it to anyone in order to avoid jail.
Marilyn Manson was dropped by his record label, Loma Vista Recordings, after Evan Rachel Wood accused the singer of ""horrifically abusing"" her ""for years.""
A source close to Manson told NBC News that the video described was scripted. A representative for Manson's team strongly denied Doe's allegations.
""The actress in the film was an adult who had also appeared in a previous music video called 'The Long Hard Road Out of Hell,'"" the source said. ""The scripted short film was meant to be an extra video feature for an upcoming album release, but it was never released.""
In February, police began investigating abuse allegations against Manson, who was publicly accused of abuse by numerous women, including his former girlfriend, ""Westworld"" star Evan Rachel Wood, and ""Game of Thrones"" alum Esmé Bianco.
""The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Special Victims Bureau is investigating allegation(s) of domestic violence involving Mr. Brian Warner also known as 'Marilyn Manson,' who works in the music industry,"" the police statement read at the time. ""The incidents occurred between 2009 and 2011 when Mr. Warner lived in the city of West Hollywood.""
Manson denied claims of abuse that same month, writing on Instagram, ""Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
In April, Bianco sued Manson for sexual assault.
""For far too long my abuser has been left unchecked, enabled by money, fame and an industry that turned a blind eye,"" she said in a statement. ""Despite the numerous brave women who have spoken out against Marilyn Manson, countless survivors remain silenced, and some of their voices will never be heard. My hope is that by raising mine I will help to stop Brian Warner from shattering any more lives and empower other victims to seek their own small measure of justice.""
In May, Manson was sued by his former assistant Ashley Walters, who alleged sexual exploitation and psychological abuse.
""Brian groomed me until I trusted him. I think when you've endured repeated abuse and harassment, especially from someone you trusted, it can take longer to process and understand what truly happened,"" Walters said in a statement. ""It has taken me years to fully grasp the impact this environment had on me and the recent exposure of his behavior toward other women to identify these moments for what they were.""
Manson has denied all allegations through his lawyer.

According to the lawsuit, Manson asked the plaintiff to move in with him two weeks into the relationship and that she was ""required to be with him quite often.""
She kept her old apartment, but he would ""text her incessantly"" when she went to her old apartment, the lawsuit said.
The complaint also alleges Manson showed the plaintiff a videotape of himself allegedly abusing a different young woman by tying her to a chair, threatening her with a gun and making her drink what appeared to be urine.
Jane Doe said Manson told her he had filmed the video in 1996 and kept the tape locked in a safe for years.
After seeing it, the plaintiff said she feared for her life after viewing the video and said sex with Manson begame increasingly violent, that he would grab her forcefully -- and that when she attempted to return a key to his house, he allegedly raped and threatened to kill her.
According to the lawsuit, the woman repressed her memories of the alleged rape until earlier this year, when multiple women publicly accused him of sexual and physical abuse.

Frau erwähnt verstörendes Video: Neue Vorwürfe gegen Marilyn Manson,"Schock-Rocker Marilyn Manson gerät immer mehr unter Druck. Berichten zufolge verklagt eine weitere Frau den Musiker wegen Vergewaltigung. In den Gerichtsunterlagen ist auch die Rede von einem verstörenden Video, welches ihr Manson gezeigt haben soll.
Die Negativ-Schlagzeilen um Marilyn Manson reißen nicht ab. Nun wird der Musiker von einer weiteren Frau verklagt, die ihm vorwirft, sie vergewaltigt zu haben. Das berichtet das US-Promi-Portal ""TMZ"".
In Gerichtsunterlagen, die der Seite vorliegen sollen, heißt es unter anderem: Die nicht namentlich genannte Frau soll mit Manson im Jahr 2011 in einer Beziehung gewesen sein. Anfänglich soll diese noch ""romantisch und sanft"" gewesen sein. Später habe Manson ihr dann ein verstörendes Video gezeigt, indem eine Frau im Jahr 1996 sexuell gedemütigt und mit einer Waffe bedroht worden sei. Die Frau sei von dem Video dermaßen geschockt gewesen, dass sie um ihr eigenes Leben gefürchtet habe.
Nachdem die Beziehung beendet gewesen sei, habe Manson die Frau vergewaltigt, als sie dem Musiker seinen Hausschlüssel zurückgebracht habe. Außerdem soll er damit gedroht haben, sie umzubringen. Ein Sprecher Mansons wollte die in der Klage beschriebenen Vorgänge auf ""TMZ""-Anfrage nicht kommentieren. Bei dem Video soll es sich allerdings um einen gescripteten Kurzfilm gehandelt haben, der für ein Projekt gedacht war, das dann nie veröffentlicht worden sei.
Seit Anfang des Jahres erheben mehrere Frauen schwere Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen den Schock-Rocker. Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte im Februar dieses Jahres ""Westworld""-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood, die mehrere Jahre mit Manson liiert gewesen war. Die Schauspielerinnen Esmé Bianco sowie Mansons ehemalige Assistentin Ashley Walters haben Klage gegen den Musiker eingereicht.
Außerdem ermittelt die Polizei Gilford im US-Bundesstaat New Hampshire gegen Manson aufgrund mutmaßlicher Körperverletzung. Laut US-Medienberichten soll der Sänger bei einem Konzert 2019 eine Filmkamera bespuckt haben.
Manson weist bislang alle Vorwürfe von sich. In einem Statement teilte er mit: ""Offensichtlich waren mein Leben und meine Kunst lange Zeit Magneten für Kontroversen, aber diese jüngsten Behauptungen über mich sind schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität."" Sein Musiklabel und sein Manager hatten später die Zusammenarbeit mit Manson beendet.",2021-05-29T20:20:22Z,https://www.n-tv.de,n-tv NACHRICHTEN

"Marilyn Manson's ex-girlfriend accuses him of rape, abuse in lawsuit","An ex-girlfriend of Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against the goth singer, alleging that he raped and physically abused her during their relationship.
The suit was filed Friday in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. The woman asked to remain anonymous because she ""has very reasonable fears,"" it states. She is the latest woman to come forward with allegations against Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner.
The woman, referred to as ""Jane Doe,"" said the abuse began in 2011 after she met Manson at a pre-Grammy party. Days after they met, Manson invited her over to his apartment to watch a movie while his then-assistant Ashley Walters chaperoned, the lawsuit states.
Walters has filed her own lawsuit against the singer alleging sexual exploitation and psychological abuse. A representative for Manson denied any accusations of assault made by Walters.
Jane Doe's suit says that her romantic relationship with Manson was consensual at first, but accuses him of using his celebrity status and power to ""to exploit and victimize"" her.
""Defendant lured plaintiff, a musician, into what was, at first, a consensual romantic relationship. A short time later, however, he raped Ms. Doe. He also subjected Ms. Doe to further degrading acts of sexual exploitation, manipulation, and psychological abuse,"" it alleges.
According to the lawsuit, Manson told Jane Doe that he loved her about two weeks into their relationship and asked her to move in with him. The suit says that Manson made it clear that she was ""required to be with him quite often"" unless he was rehearsing or at another engagement.
The woman agreed to move in with him but kept her old apartment, which she shared with her aunt. Soon after moving in, Manson became ""increasingly controlling"" and would text the woman ""incessantly"" when she went to her old apartment.
When she didn't return home fast enough, Manson would punish her, according to the lawsuit.
The suit also accuses Manson of denying her food and demanding ""extremely frequent sex."" It says that Manson would force her to have sex with him and he would often become violent during intercourse, leaving her with bruises.
The day that the woman went to Manson's apartment to return his key, he raped her, according to the lawsuit.
""He was saying that she had driven him crazy, and she was making him do this to her,"" the suit states. ""Afterward, while standing in the doorway, he said to her: 'Don’t you ever f------ make me do that to you again.'""
It continues: ""Warner then threatened to kill plaintiff. He also bragged that he would 'get away with it' if he indeed murdered her.""
The lawsuit also details troubling allegations about Manson's relationship with actress Evan Rachel Wood and an encounter he had with a young girl.
According to the lawsuit, Manson told Jane Doe that he wanted to kill Wood and had tied her to a chair and pointed a gun at her.
""He said he considered killing Ms. Wood, but then decided to be merciful,"" the suit states.
Wood said in a February Instagram post that Manson started grooming her as a teenager ""and horrifically abused"" her for years. Following her allegations, Manson's record label said that it would immediately stop promoting his latest album and would not work with him on future projects.
Manson responded in a February Instagram post, writing that ""these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
Jane Doe's lawsuit also says that Manson played a video for her that showed him berating and threatening a young girl after she came to a room where he had been partying with his bandmates. The video allegedly showed Manson tie up the girl and interrogate her as she cried, according to the lawsuit.
Manson then removed the girl's shirt and forced her to drink a glass containing his bandmate's urine, the suit claims. The singer also threatened the girl with a gun, it says.
""Plaintiff had never seen anything so disturbing, and was traumatized,"" the lawsuit says.
The woman said in the suit that she decided to come forward after other women shared similar experiences.
A member of Manson's team strongly denied the allegations made in Jane Doe's suit.
A source close to the singer said the video ""is a scripted short film"" that was shot by a crew who frequently worked with Manson and featured an adult actress.
""The actress in the film was an adult who had also appeared in a previous music video called 'The Long Hard Road Out of Hell.' The scripted short film was meant to be an extra video feature for an upcoming album release, but it was never released,"" the source said.
Manson, 52, has not been charged with any crime. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in February that it had launched a domestic violence investigation about alleged incidents when the singer lived in West Hollywood. This was announced after Wood's allegations.
The singer is also facing misdemeanor assault counts out of New Hampshire. Earlier this week, the Gilford Police Department said that they had an arrest warrant for Manson related to an incident at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion involving a videographer.
The alleged incident happened during a concert in 2019, but what exactly occurred was not made clear by the police. An attorney for the singer called the claim ""ludicrous"" but said they are committed to cooperating with authorities.",2021-05-29T15:57:08Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
Marilyn Manson este acuzat iar de viol: Cum își umilea partenerele sexuale,"Cântăreţul american Marilyn Manson a fost vizat vineri de o nouă plângere de viol, de data aceasta formulată de o fostă parteneră, care îl acuză, de asemenea, că a forţat-o să urmărească un videoclip în care agresează o tânără fană, informează sâmbătă AFP.
Plângerea formulată împotriva lui Marilyn Manson, al cărui nume real este Brian Warner, a fost depusă la Los Angeles de o tânără a cărei identitate nu a fost dezvăluită şi care susţine că a început o relaţie cu muzicianul în 2011.
Ea îl acuză pe Manson că a ""violat-o în mod repetat şi a agresat-o sexual"", scrie agerpres.ro.
De asemenea, potrivit plângerii, Manson i-ar fi arătat acesteia o înregistrare video în care leagă de un scaun o tânără fană, pe care o umileşte şi o insultă, înainte de a o obliga să bea un pahar cu urină şi să o ameninţe cu arma.
Un membru al anturajului lui Manson a negat acuzaţiile formulate vineri, în timp ce o sursă apropiată a cântăreţului a dat asigurări că a fost vorba despre ""un scurtmetraj de ficţiune"", în care apare o actriţă adultă, înregistrare video ce nu a fost niciodată făcută publică.
Luna trecuta, actriţa Esmé Bianco a depus o plângere împotriva cântăreţului, acuzându-l de viol, agresiune sexuală cu caracter sadic şi violenţe repetate.

Marilyn Manson é acusado de abuso sexual e ameaça em novo processo,"SÃO PAULO, SP (FOLHAPRESS) – Marilyn Manson, 52, está sendo acusado de estupro por mais uma ex-namorada. Segundo a revista People, a mulher, que não teve o nome revelado no processo, afirma que sofreu abuso sexual em diversas ocasiões durante o relacionamento que teve com ele, em 2011.
De acordo com a publicação, a mulher afirma que Manson lhe mostrou uma fita de vídeo dele mesmo supostamente abusando de uma jovem, amarrando-a a uma cadeira, fazendo-a beber o que parecia ser urina e ameaçando-a com uma arma.
Ela afirma que passou a temer por sua vida depois de ver as imagens e que o sexo com o roqueiro se tornou cada vez mais violento, com ele agarrando-a com “extrema força”. Ele teria ainda forçado ela a fazer sexo oral após recusar avanços do músico.
A mulher afirma que, quando tentou devolver as chaves da casa de Manson, foi estuprada e ameaçada de morte pelo cantor, com ele dizendo que se safaria se a matasse. Ela alega ainda que “reprimiu” essas lembranças até ouvir sobre outras as acusações contra ele, em fevereiro deste ano.
Nos últimos meses, diversas mulheres acusaram Manson de assédio, estupro e agressão. Ex-noiva do cantor, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, 33, disse que ele começou a assediá-la quando ela ainda era adolescente. “Ele abusou terrivelmente de mim por anos”, afirmou a atriz.
Também acusaram Manson sua ex-assistente Ashley Walters e a atriz Esmé Bianco, de “Game of Thrones”. Na nova acusação, a mulher, identificada no processo como “Jane Doe”, processa o cantor por danos e uma declaração de que sua conduta infringiu a lei, segundo a revista People.
Além das acusações de abuso sexual em investigação, o músico tem um mandado de prisão pendente contra ele no Departamento de Polícia de Gilford, no estado de New Hampshire (EUA) por duas acusações de agressões ocorridas em 2019.
Em 18 de agosto daquele ano, Manson fez um show no local. De acordo com a polícia, as acusações estão relacionadas a essa apresentação e envolvem um cinegrafista contratado por uma empresa local para gravar o show. Manson teria cuspido no cinegrafista, mas a polícia não detalhou as ocorrências.
O advogado de Manson disse à NBC News que a acusação é “ridícula”, mas que eles estão comprometidos em cooperar com as autoridades. “Não é segredo para ninguém que assistiu a um show do Marilyn Manson que ele gosta de ser provocador no palco, especialmente na frente de uma câmera”, afirmou Howard King.
Sobre as acusações de abuso sexual, Manson se posicionou em suas redes sociais no início de fevereiro. “Obviamente minha arte e minha vida sempre foram ímãs para polêmica, mas essas afirmações recentes sobre mim são horríveis distorções da realidade”, escreveu em seu Instagram.
“Meus relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram totalmente consensuais com companheiras que pensam como eu. Independentemente de como, e por quê, outras estão optando hoje por manipular o passado, esta é a verdade”, completou o artista.",2021-05-29T13:20:00Z,https://www.mixvale.com.br,Portal Mix Vale
Marilyn Manson sofre nova acusação de estupro,"Mulher afirma ter iniciado um relacionamento com o cantor em 2011 e o acusa de tê-la “estuprado e agredido sexualmente de forma reiterada”
O roqueiro americano Marilyn Manson foi acusado nesta sexta-feira de estupro em uma nova denúncia, desta vez de uma ex-namorada, que também o acusa de tê-la obrigado a assistir a um vídeo em que ele abusa sexualmente de uma fã.
A denúncia contra Manson, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Warner, foi feita em Los Angeles, por uma jovem cuja identidade não foi revelada. Ela afirma ter iniciado um relacionamento com o cantor em 2011 e o acusa de tê-la “estuprado e agredido sexualmente de forma reiterada”.
Um membro do entorno do cantor negou as acusações, enquanto uma fonte ligada a Manson afirmou que o vídeo era “um curta-metragem de ficção” em que aparece uma atriz adulta e que nunca foi exibido.
No mês passado, a atriz Esme Bianco apresentou uma denúncia contra o cantor, acusando-o de estupro, agressão sexual sádica e violência reiterada. Outras mulheres, incluindo a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, também acusaram Mason recentemente por fatos semelhantes, negados pelo cantor.
Em fevereiro, a polícia de Los Angeles confirmou que estava investigando denúncias de violência doméstica contra o roqueiro referente ao período entre 2009 e 2011.

Marilyn Manson accused of rape and sexual assault in new lawsuit; singer's team 'strongly' denies allegation,"The new lawsuit alleges Manson 'raped and repeatedly sexually abused' the accuser.
US goth rocker Marilyn Manson was Friday hit with new allegations that he raped an ex-girlfriend and forced her to watch a video of him abusing a young fan.
The latest lawsuit against Manson — real name Brian Warner — on behalf of an anonymous woman comes after Game of Thrones actress Esme Bianco last month accused him of rape, sexual abuse and violence.
The new lawsuit alleges that Manson ""raped and repeatedly sexually abused"" Jane Doe.
Manson allegedly showed the plaintiff a video in which he could be seen tying a young fan to a chair, where he ""humiliated and berated her,"" removed her T-shirt, forced her to drink a glass of urine, and threatened her with a gun.
A member of Manson's team strongly denied the accusations Friday.
A source close to Manson said the video was a ""scripted short film"" featuring an adult actor that was never released.
Manson's lawyer Howard King described the previous claims by Bianco as ""provably false"" and accused Bianco and her attorney of making ""outrageous financial demands based on conduct that simply never occurred.""
Los Angeles police in February confirmed they were investigating domestic violence allegations against the singer between 2009 and 2011.
Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood has also accused Manson of years of abuse starting when she was a teenager — allegations Manson called ""horrible distortions of reality"" in an Instagram post.
Manson, who has long cultivated a controversial image with his ghostly make-up and stage name evoking serial killer Charles Manson, has parted ways with his record label Loma Vista Recordings and Hollywood agency CAA since the allegations became public.",2021-05-29T12:28:26Z,https://www.firstpost.com,Firstpost
Marilyn Manson accusé de viols : cette vidéo horrible qu'il aurait montrée à une de ses victimes,"Marylin Manson fait l'objet d'une nouvelle plainte pour viol, selon les informations publiées par People ce samedi 29 mai. La victime a évoqué une vidéo traumatisante.
Il est dans la tourmente. Le 1er février dernier, l'actrice Evan Rachel Wood accusait son ex Marilyn Manson de ""violences sexuelles"". Par la suite, ce sont d'autres jeunes femmes qui sont sorties du silence au fil des mois, dont ce vendredi 28 mai. Selon les informations publiées par People, une ex-petite amie du chanteur a déposé plainte contre Marylin Manson, l'accusant de faits qui se sont déroulés à partir de 2011. Entendue par les gendarmes, la jeune femme, dont l'identitée n'a pas été dévoilée, a accusé l'artiste de 52 ans de l'avoir ""violée et agressée sexuellement de manière répétée"". Elle a également évoqué une horrible vidéo, que Marilyn Manson l'aurait obligé à regarder à plusieurs reprises. Selon ses dires, sur celle-ci, on peut voir le chanteur ligoter une jeune femme sur une chaise pour l'humilier l'insulter, avant de l'obliger à boire un verre d'urine et de la menacer à l'aide d'une arme à feu. Rapidement, un membre de l'entourage de Marilyn Manson a souhaité démentir les faits, affirmant qu'il s'agit d'un ""court-métrage de fiction, dans lequel figure une actrice adulte"" mais aussi que ""celui-ci n'a jamais été rendu public"".
Elle a été traumatisée. Dans sa plainte, la jeune femme n'a pas hésité à donner davantage de précisions. Elle a révélé avoir eu ""peur pour ma vie après avoir vu la vidéo"" et a également indiqué que faire l'amour avec Marilyn Manson était ""devenu incroyablement violent par la suite"". En effet, la victime présumée affirme que le chanteur pouvait ""m'attraper avec une très grande force"" et elle s'est également souvenue du jour où elle a été ""forcée de lui faire une fellation alors que j'avais refusé ses avances"". Par la suite, elle a mentionné cette fois où elle s'était rendue au domicile de l'artiste pour lui rendre une clé. ""Il m'a violée et a essayé de me tuer. Il m'a également précisé qu'il pourrait s'en sortir, sans aucune conséquence, si il parvenait à me tuer"", explique-t-elle. Si la jeune femme n'a souhaité sortir du silence que plusieurs années après les faits, c'est aussi car, selon ses propos, elle avait fait le choix ""de réprimer les souvenirs de mon viol"", jusqu'en février dernier, lorsque plusieurs femmes sont sorties du silence. Une initiative qui a donné le courage à d'autres victimes de s'exprimer.
Une nouvelle enquête pour Marilyn Manson
Déjà dans le collimateur de la justice pour des faits de violences sexuelles, le chanteur est visé par un mandat d'arrêt ainsi que deux chefs d'accusation ""d'agression simple"". Ceux-ci font suite à un incident qui se serait déroulé en août 2019, à la suite d'un de ses concerts. Alors que Brian Hugh Warner, de son vrai nom, a été informé de cette action judiciaire, il semblerait qu'il ne souhaite pas en tenir compte. ""Aucun effort n'a été fait de son côté pour revenir au New Hampshire afin de répondre aux accusations en cours"", ont indiqué les autorités. Marilyn Manson n'a pour l'instant pas répondu à ce message.

Marilyn Manson: Weitere Frau beschuldigt ihn der Vergewaltigung,"Die Negativ-Schlagzeilen um Marilyn Manson (52) reißen nicht ab. Nun wird der Musiker von einer weiteren Frau verklagt, die ihm vorwirft, sie vergewaltigt zu haben. Das berichtet das US-Promi-Portal ""TMZ"".
In Gerichtsunterlagen, die der Seite vorliegen sollen, heißt es unter anderem: Die nicht namentlich genannte Frau soll mit Manson im Jahr 2011 in einer Beziehung gewesen sein. Anfänglich soll diese noch ""romantisch und sanft"" gewesen sein. Später habe Manson ihr dann ein verstörendes Video gezeigt, indem eine Frau im Jahr 1996 sexuell gedemütigt und mit einer Waffe bedroht worden sei. Die Frau sei von dem Video dermaßen geschockt gewesen, dass sie um ihr eigenes Leben gefürchtet habe.
Nachdem die Beziehung beendet gewesen sei, habe Manson die Frau vergewaltigt, als sie dem Musiker seinen Hausschlüssel zurückgebracht habe. Außerdem soll er damit gedroht haben, sie umzubringen.
Ein Sprecher Mansons wollte die in der Klage beschriebenen Vorgänge auf ""TMZ""-Anfrage nicht kommentieren. Bei dem Video soll es sich allerdings um einen gescripteten Kurzfilm gehandelt haben, der für ein Projekt gedacht war, das dann nie veröffentlicht worden sei.
Mehrere laufende Verfahren gegen Marilyn Manson
Seit Anfang des Jahres erheben mehrere Frauen schwere Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen den Schock-Rocker. Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte im Februar dieses Jahres ""Westworld""-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (33), die mehrere Jahre mit Manson liiert gewesen war. Die Schauspielerinnen Esmé Bianco (39) sowie Mansons ehemalige Assistentin Ashley Walters haben Klage gegen den Musiker eingereicht.
Außerdem ermittelt die Polizei Gilford im US-Bundesstaat New Hampshire gegen Manson aufgrund mutmaßlicher Körperverletzung. Laut US-Medienberichten soll der Sänger bei einem Konzert 2019 eine Filmkamera bespuckt haben.
Manson weist bislang alle Vorwürfe von sich. In einem Statement teilte er mit: ""Offensichtlich waren mein Leben und meine Kunst lange Zeit Magneten für Kontroversen, aber diese jüngsten Behauptungen über mich sind schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität."" Sein Musiklabel und sein Manager hatten später die Zusammenarbeit mit Manson beendet.

Marilyn Manson opnieuw aangeklaagd door ex-vriendin,"Marilyn Manson is door een voormalige vriendin aangeklaagd omdat hij haar onder meer zou hebben verkracht. Volgens de vrouw, die anoniem wil blijven en in de aanklacht Jane Doe wordt genoemd, zou de zanger haar ook mentaal en fysiek hebben mishandeld.
Volgens de vrouw gebeurde het allemaal in 2011 toen zij met de rocker aan het daten was. Hoewel het in het begin een ""consensuele romantische relatie"" was, begon Manson de vrouw later te verkrachten en onderwierp hij haar aan andere ""vernederende handelingen van seksuele uitbuiting, manipulatie en psychologisch misbruik"".
De zanger, die in het echt Brian Warner heet, zou deze Jane Doe onder meer al na twee weken daten bij hem in hebben laten trekken. Hoewel hij zijn appartement altijd ijskoud hield, verlangde hij wel van haar dat zij altijd naakt rondliep. Ook zou hij de vrouw geen eten hebben gegeven, omdat zij te dik zou zijn geweest volgens hem.
Onder vuur
De nieuwe aanklacht tegen Manson kan op de steeds langer wordende lijst van vergrijpen waar de zanger van beschuldigd wordt. Jane Doe is de zoveelste vrouw die Manson beschuldigt van grensoverschrijdend gedrag.
De zanger ligt al een tijdje onder vuur nadat actrice Evan Rachel Wood begin februari via sociale media liet weten jarenlang door de zanger misbruikt en mishandeld te zijn. Nadat zij met haar verhaal naar buiten trad, volgden er meer vrouwen met soortgelijke verhalen. De politie van Los Angeles onderzoekt de zaak.

Plângerea formulată împotriva lui Marilyn Manson, al cărui nume real este Brian Warner, a fost depusă la Los Angeles de o tânără a cărei identitate nu a fost dezvăluită şi care susţine că a început o relaţie cu muzicianul în 2011.
Ea îl acuză pe Manson că a „violat-o în mod repetat şi a agresat-o sexual”.
De asemenea, potrivit plângerii, Manson i-ar fi arătat acesteia o înregistrare video în care leagă de un scaun o tânără fană, pe care o umileşte şi o insultă, înainte de a o obliga să bea un pahar cu urină şi să o ameninţe cu arma.
Un membru al anturajului lui Manson a negat acuzaţiile formulate vineri, în timp ce o sursă apropiată a cântăreţului a dat asigurări că a fost vorba despre „un scurtmetraj de ficţiune”, în care apare o actriţă adultă, înregistrare video ce nu a fost niciodată făcută publică.
Luna trecuta, actriţa Esmé Bianco a depus o plângere împotriva cântăreţului, acuzându-l de viol, agresiune sexuală cu caracter sadic şi violenţe repetate.
Mai multe femei, inclusiv actriţa Evan Rachel Wood, l-au acuzat recent pe Marilyn Manson de fapte similare, pe care acesta din urmă le-a negat.

"Marilyn Manson Faces 3rd Lawsuit, Jane Doe Accuses Him Of Rape: Report","As the saying goes, when it rains, it pours, and it must be monsoon season for Marilyn Manson. Unchecked allegations of sexual and physical abuse brought against shock-rocker Marilyn Manson spans back to the late 1990s, but only within the last few years have several women not only stepped forward to share their stories but to take Manson to court. In recent months, we've shared a series of reports and updates regarding legal woes for the singer as people including ex-girlfriends and assistants have vocalized allegations of rape, domestic violence, and sexual battery.
Manson has repeatedly denied each new accusation through statements issued by his attorneys, and on the heels of two lawsuits filed byGame of Thrones actress Esmé Bianco and the singer's former assistant Ashley Walters, there's another legal battle on the horizon.

A new lawsuit was filed by ""Jane Doe"" who claims that she dated the rocker back in 2011 and during their courtship, he allegedly showed her a video that ""depicted abuse of a groupie after a 1996"" concert in Hollywood, reports Deadline. This fan was reportedly ""forced to drink urine"" and was allegedly threatened with a firearm that she may have also been hit with at some point, but that wasn't confirmed by the publication.
TMZ reported that a source claimed the video wasn't real but was supposed to be a short film, however, it was never promoted or publicized. Jane Doe included in her lawsuit that the film was kept locked away in a safe. It was something that reportedly made the unidentified woman ""afraid for her life,"" and she asserted that when she returned to Manson's residence to give him back a key, Jane Doe alleges that the singer raped her and threatened her life.
Read through the statement that Manson has left on his Instagram page regarding allegations of assault. He hasn't updated his page since uploading the post on February 1.

Ellie Rowsell: ‘There is a power in collective stories about harassment’,"Wolf Alice’s Ellie Rowsell always had a vague understanding that the internet was full of weirdos, misogynists and people with terrible taste in music. But it was only when she spoke out about abusive behaviour by “shock rocker” Marilyn Manson that she truly understood how much bile was out there, sloshing around Twitter and elsewhere.
“I guess I feel disappointed,” the guitarist and singer says. “I should have expected it, really: that there were so many people online that were angry and, you know, ‘attacky’. I’ve seen trolls online. I’ve never had them on my case before.”
Wolf Alice are preparing to release a remarkable third album, Blue Weekend. But it’s impossible to discuss the group’s recent endeavours without bringing up Manson. This is obviously a heavy subject. Rowsell (28), however, discusses it calmly and thoughtfully.
Rowsell had decided to go public in the context of statements by Evan Rachel Wood and other women about misconduct on the part of Manson
“I met Marilyn backstage at a festival a few years ago. After his compliments towards my band became more and more hyperbolic I became suspicious of his behaviour,” she had tweeted on February 8th.
“I was shocked to look down and see he was filming up my skirt with a GoPro. There were no repercussions for his behaviour, his tour manager simply said ‘he does this kind of thing all the time’.”
Rowsell had decided to go public in the context of statements by Evan Rachel Wood and other women about misconduct on the part of Manson.
The singer was subsequently dropped by his label, touring agency and manager. Last week, his former assistant sued him for sexual assault, battery and harassment. Manson had denied earlier allegations, saying his relationships had always “been entirely consensual with like-minded partners”.
“When all the Manson stuff came out, a lot of the arguments he was using were around consent,” adds Wolf Alice guitarist Joff Oddie (29). “And the thing he did to Ellie was devoid of consent. Ellie just said, ‘I’m thinking of doing this – what do you guys think?’ And everyone unanimously said, ‘we’ll back you no matter what you decide’.”
Manson’s accusers had been subjected to an orchestrated campaign of intimidation, mud-slinging and gas-lighting by a deranged element within his fanbase. It was these attacks that persuaded Rowsell to make a statement.
“You don’t always have to speak out about your experiences – that’s entirely up you,” says Rowsell.
“Every story is different. When a number of women are bringing up a story about a particular man abusing and harassing and he has been given almost godlike status – and no one is believing these woman… Not only are they not believing them, they are attacking them, bullying them, harassing them online…”
There is strength in numbers she adds after a pause. “With more people coming forward with their stories – it shouldn’t have to take that – but it does feel there is a power in collective stories. That is the reason I felt the need to talk about it. I didn’t feel the need to talk about it just if it was my own story.”
Rowsell speaks softly yet there is steel in her voice. The same could be said of Wolf Alice’s music. All sorts of influences go into the blender: what comes out will appeal equally to fans of Hüsker Dü, Slowdive and Billie Eilish. And if you happen to be equally well-disposed towards Hüsker Dü , Slowdive AND Billie Eilish, then congratulations: Wolf Alice are probably already your favourite band of the past decade.
With a Mercury Prize win and two top five LPs under their belt, there is sense of musicians hurtling towards the bright lights. Success has had its downsides, though. Around the time the group won the Mercury for their second album, Visions Of A Life, Rowsell briefly became fodder for the tabloids. The Sun ran a story that she had become engaged to Slaves singer Isaac Holman.
This was in no way a scoop – who cares about the domestic doings of indie singers? – yet was presented as the bombshell of the century.
“It’s not news – why are they putting it in the newspapers?” she says. “I would imagine that it’s very scary if that happens to you all the time. Do we need newspapers doing that stuff? It’s just so old-fashioned.”
Rowsell and Oddie are from North London and Plymouth respectively and first played together as an acoustic duo in 2010. The name Wolf Alice comes from a short story by Company of Wolves author Angela Carter about a girl raised by wolves (“ she cannot speak, although she howls,” it begins).
Their recent single, The Last Man On Earth, for instance, is a gothic power-ballad suggesting Tori Amos collaborating with Joy Division
Four years and countless gigs later, and now expanded to a four-piece, they signed to Dirty Hit, the London label which has nurtured The 1975, Beabadoobee and others. A debut LP, My Love Is Cool, followed in 2015. It charted at two in the UK and earned Wolf Alice their first Mercury nomination.
Wolf Alice have a rare gift for applying themselves to different genres – whether that be the post-grunge of Yuk Foo or the Kate Bush-at-the-indie-disco of Don’t Delete The Kisses.
But because this is 2021 and we’re not allowed have nice things, they’ve sometimes been called out for not being “radical” enough. The case against them is they’re a tad “indie schmindie”.That there is something old fashioned about four Londoners rocking out in a well-worn angsty style.
As it happens, there’s a lot more to Wolf Alice than student disco anthems (not that there is anything wrong with student disco anthems – how poorer all our lives would be without them).
Their recent single, The Last Man On Earth, for instance, is a gothic power-ballad suggesting Tori Amos collaborating with Joy Division. It’s a stunning showcase for Rowsell’s voice, to boot: when she bursts into the chorus of “Let it shine on you” the song leaves its earthly orbit and shoots off into the heavens.
And yet, Wolf Alice were held pinned and wriggling on the wall slightly when winning the Mercury in 2018. Even those who admired the record felt obliged to grumble about Visions Of A Life placing ahead of a field that included King Krule, Jorja Smith, Lily Allen and Sons of Kemet.
Blue Weekend was largely recorded in Brussels during the first lockdown early last year and feels like the culmination of everything they’ve worked towards in their career to date
“Wolf Alice are worthy winners – but the Mercury prize must think bigger,” went a headline in the Guardian. “So what is the Prize’s aim today? Wolf Alice don’t exactly help answer that question,” added the London Independent.
“Of course it bothered me a bit,” says Rowsell, herself a Mercury judge in 2016. “You get given something nice and someone says you don’t deserve it – you always second guess yourself. It’s just a celebration of music. It doesn’t mean you’re any better than anyone else.”
Blue Weekend was largely recorded in Brussels during the first lockdown early last year and feels like the culmination of everything they’ve worked towards in their career to date.
Its release follows an appearance by the band at this year’s live-streamed Live at Worthy Farm event from Glastonbury (the virtual festival was a technical disaster but by every account Wolf Alice, performing in the middle of a stone circle, shone). And whenever Glastonbury returns in earnest, the chatter is that Wolf Alice will make for potential headliners. They are also very plausible contenders to headline Electric Picnic 2022.
“After every album, there’s usually a handful of shows where we go – ‘can we do this?,” says Oddie.
“You look back at the very early days, doing Dingwalls in Camden. We’d sold it out: 500 capacity. It was the most nerves I’ve ever had for a concert: ‘500 people is a ridiculous amount, can I do this?’. But we had faith. And on the next record it was Shepherd’s Bush Empire, and then Brixton Academy and then Alexandra Palace and the main stages of festivals. It feels like we’re ready to take the next step, whatever that may be.”
Blue Weekend is released June 4th",2021-05-29T04:00:00Z,https://www.irishtimes.com,The Irish Times

"Marilyn Manson Accused Of Rape, Assault In Lawsuit By Ex-Girlfriend","Rocker Marilyn Manson has more legal troubles on his plate. A lawsuit has been filed by an ex-girlfriend in Los Angeles County state Superior Court, claiming he raped her and forced her to watch a gruesome film depicting abuse of a groupie.
The lawsuit was filed by a “Jane Doe,” who claims she started dating Manson, aka Brian Warner, in 2011.
In its most sensational claim, the lawsuit contends Manson showed her a video he kept locked in a safe. The video allegedly depicted abuse of a groupie after a 1996 appearance by the band at the Hollywood Bowl. The young fan is allegedly forced to drink urine, was threatened with a gun, and may have been pistol-whipped.
TMZ reported that a source claims the video is actually a scripted short film intended for a project that was shelved.The film, the woman claimed in the legal documents, left her afraid for her life.But when she went to return a key to Manson’s home, she alleges he forcibly raped her and threatened to kill her.
The Jane Doe lawsuit asks for damages and a declaration that the Manson conduct broke the law.
Manson is also being sued by a former assistant/girlfriend, Game of Thrones actress Esme Bianco.
The complete law documents can be found here: Manson lawsuit
There has been no official comment from Manson on the latest allegations. He has previously denied Bianco’s claims.",2021-05-29T01:16:49Z,https://deadline.com,Deadline
Marilyn Manson: Weitere Frau beschuldigt ihn der Vergewaltigung,"In Gerichtsunterlagen, die der Seite vorliegen sollen, heißt es unter anderem: Die nicht namentlich genannte Frau soll mit Manson im Jahr 2011 in einer Beziehung gewesen sein. Anfänglich soll diese noch ""romantisch und sanft"" gewesen sein. Später habe Manson ihr dann ein verstörendes Video gezeigt, indem eine Frau im Jahr 1996 sexuell gedemütigt und mit einer Waffe bedroht worden sei. Die Frau sei von dem Video dermaßen geschockt gewesen, dass sie um ihr eigenes Leben gefürchtet habe.
Nachdem die Beziehung beendet gewesen sei, habe Manson die Frau vergewaltigt, als sie dem Musiker seinen Hausschlüssel zurückgebracht habe. Außerdem soll er damit gedroht haben, sie umzubringen.
Ein Sprecher Mansons wollte die in der Klage beschriebenen Vorgänge auf ""TMZ""-Anfrage nicht kommentieren. Bei dem Video soll es sich allerdings um einen gescripteten Kurzfilm gehandelt haben, der für ein Projekt gedacht war, das dann nie veröffentlicht worden sei.
Mehrere laufende Verfahren
Seit Anfang des Jahres erheben mehrere Frauen schwere Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen den Schock-Rocker. Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte im Februar dieses Jahres ""Westworld""-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (33), die mehrere Jahre mit Manson liiert gewesen war. Die Schauspielerinnen Esmé Bianco (39) sowie Mansons ehemalige Assistentin Ashley Walters haben Klage gegen den Musiker eingereicht.
Außerdem ermittelt die Polizei Gilford im US-Bundesstaat New Hampshire gegen Manson aufgrund mutmaßlicher Körperverletzung. Laut US-Medienberichten soll der Sänger bei einem Konzert 2019 eine Filmkamera bespuckt haben.
Manson weist bislang alle Vorwürfe von sich. In einem Statement teilte er mit: ""Offensichtlich waren mein Leben und meine Kunst lange Zeit Magneten für Kontroversen, aber diese jüngsten Behauptungen über mich sind schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität."" Sein Musiklabel und sein Manager hatten später die Zusammenarbeit mit Manson beendet.

Marilyn Manson opnieuw aangeklaagd voor verkrachting,"Volgens de vrouw speelde de gebeurtenissen zich in 2011 af toen zij met de rocker aan het daten was. Hoewel het in het begin een ’romantische relatie’ was, zou Manson de vrouw later hebben verkracht. Ook stelt ze door hem te zijn onderworpen aan andere ’vernederende handelingen van seksuele uitbuiting, manipulatie en psychologisch misbruik.’
De zanger, die in het echt Brian Warner heet, zou deze Jane Doe onder meer al na twee weken daten bij hem in hebben laten trekken. Hoewel hij zijn appartement altijd ijskoud hield, verlangde hij wel van haar dat zij altijd naakt rondliep. Ook zou hij de vrouw geen eten hebben gegeven, omdat hij haar te dik vond.

mulher processa cantor por estupro,"Uma suposta ex-namorada de Marilyn Manson processou o artista por estupro. Os dois teriam se relacionado em 2011. As informações são do TMZ.
Nos documentos do processo judicial, a mulher anônima alegou que o cantor a estuprou enquanto ela devolvia a chave de sua casa. Manson teria a colocado de bruços no chão, cometido o ato e a ameaçado de morte.
O suposto relacionamento dos dois era romântico e gentil no começo.
Além disso, ela disse que Manson a obrigou a assistir filme caseiro no qual simulava matar fã. A suposta filmagem de 1996 mostrava o cantor forçando a pessoa a beber urina de integrante da banda enquanto estava amarrada em uma cadeira.
O vídeo teria sido feito após show da banda no Hollywood Bowl, em Los Angeles (EUA), e incluía atos sexuais, humilhações e uma arma.

Marilyn Manson: emiten orden de captura contra el cantante por agresión,"Marilyn Manson se encuentra con orden de captura por la Policía de Nuevo Hampshire, en Estados Unidos. Las autoridades emitieron el documento judicial el último miércoles 26 de mayo, que posteriormente se hizo público por diversos medios.
Esta notificación de búsqueda corresponde a un incidente que el cantante protagonizó durante un concierto que tuvo lugar en agosto del 2019.
El intérprete de “Sweet dreams” agredió a un camarógrafo en el evento. Tres asistentes, quienes declararon a People, aseguraron que vieron a Marilyn Manson escupir al operador técnico.
La orden de arresto se encuentra vigente desde octubre del 2019; sin embargo, el artista musical no se ha acercado a la localidad para esclarecer las agresiones. En ese sentido, la Policía decidió hacerlo público a través de sus redes.
Los cargos, según detallan las autoridades, podrían ser sancionados con una multa de 2.000 dólares y hasta un año de pena privativa de la libertad.
Marilyn Manson envuelto en denuncias
Desde hace algunos meses, Marilyn Manson viene teniendo problemas con la justicia por denuncias de violación sexual. Esmé Bianco, actriz que participó en la serie Juego de tronos, lo acusó de haberla drogado, golpeado y violado, entre otros abusos.
Según TMZ, quienes obtuvieron los documentos, el cantante la contactó en 2005 y posteriormente inició con insinuaciones sexuales al pedirle fotos íntimas.
En 2009, ella viajó con el artista a Los Ángeles para grabar un videoclip. “La mantuvieron en la casa de Manson y la obligaron a usar lencería todo el tiempo. Ella alega que Manson se enfurecería y destruía equipos. También afirma que él la encerró en un dormitorio, la ató, la azotó y la sometió a descargas eléctricas. El video musical nunca se produjo”, describió la demandada.

Wolf Alice’s Ellie Rowsell on that Marilyn Manson upskirting incident,"In a far corner of an industrial estate in Tottenham, north London, beyond a skip piled high with Coca-Cola bottles, through a heavy metal door and up two flights of stairs, Ellie Rowsell stands awkwardly in the middle of the room. She has climbed out of the silver frock she was wearing for the camera and back into civvies: jeans, white vest and blue shirt. The silver dress hangs back on the rail and for a moment it seems as though all of Rowsell’s front-of-camera boldness might have been put away with it.
Today’s photo shoot comes a couple of weeks before the release of Wolf Alice’s new album, Blue Weekend, and as the band’s lead singer and only female member, Rowsell, 28, is once again navigating the glare of the spotlight. It is not an easy place for her. She recalls how just the day before, recording a session for Radio 1, the producer had encouraged her to speak between songs. ‘I just couldn’t say anything,’ she recalls. ‘And then I sang, and I felt so good. Just really confident. And I thought, “I wish I could be that all the time.”’
Wolf Alice formed in 2010 when Rowsell came across a video of Joff Oddie, 30, playing guitar online. She was already writing songs, largely influenced by the folk music of the north London Irish community in which she lived, but she lacked the confidence to play live. Oddie, a recent transplant from Devon, was impressed by Rowsell’s fledgling songwriting skills.
Two years later they had added an electronic twist to their songs and were joined by bassist Theo Ellis, 29, and drummer Joel Amey, 30. They signed to independent label Dirty Hit, home to The 1975, and then released their debut, My Love Is Cool. Theirs was a sound that captured the mood of young London; with songs such as ‘Fluffy’ and ‘Bros’, Rowsell sang of friendships and desire, of freedom and boredom and bus rides home.

It was their second album, Visions Of A Life, that brought major success — beating Arctic Monkeys, Lily Allen and Noel Gallagher to the Mercury Prize in 2018. Life seemed to change from that moment. After the ceremony, the band retired to The Hawley Arms in Camden (where their Mercury statuette still lives, nestled among the crisps) and the following day flew off on tour to Australia. But suddenly they were celebrities: at Heathrow they saw themselves on the TV news and on the front pages of the newspapers.
That level of fame doesn’t sit well with Rowsell. She is a beguiling frontwoman: magnetic, photogenic, possessed with a voice that can range from sweetness to fury. But even three albums deep she is still that strange contradiction of fearlessness and nerves. Today she sits folded in on herself and when she speaks, her sentences tend to blaze brightly and then quickly fizzle out, as if startled by their own flare.
The first time I met the band, in a café in Holloway in 2015, Rowsell was near-mute. But over the years, as I have interviewed Wolf Alice around the world — on tour in Bangalore and Los Angeles, in Manchester and London — it has been interesting to see her personality emerge; to watch the transformation that takes place as she warms up backstage ahead of a show, the presence she has as soon as she steps on to the stage.
‘I really can’t second guess when I’ll feel confident and when I’ll feel extremely under-confident,’ she says now. ‘I don’t really think I am that much more confident [than when we began]. But I’ve been thinking: even though I do find being on stage hard, in a way, it is almost a relief for me. Because I don’t have that social anxiety on stage.’

But she is no doormat. A few years ago, backstage at a festival, she had a run-in with the musician Marilyn Manson. ‘He’d just finished playing his show and everyone was backstage in the artists’ area,’ she explains. ‘He came up to us and went, “I love your band.” Then his compliments became more and more hyperbolic, like, “I listen to you every night before I go on stage…” And then I looked down and I realised, oh my God, he’s got his hand up my skirt with a GoPro.’
She told the festival organisers that Manson, who has since been accused of abuse by several women including his ex-partner Evan Rachel Wood, had been filming up her skirt. ‘My main concern was I don’t want him to have that footage of me,’ she says. ‘His tour manager came down and said, “We’re using that footage for his tour diary, so we can’t give you the camera.” And we had to negotiate with him: okay we can’t take the camera, but can we see you delete that footage?’ She looks appalled and weary. ‘And that was that. It wasn’t a crime back then,’ she says. ‘But it’s illegal now.’ When Rowsell tweeted about the incident she was met with backlash from Manson fans, but she appears unruffled by it. ‘It was only people online,’ she shrugs. Manson and his tour manager have yet to respond.
The band are perhaps accustomed to speaking out — they are all members of the Labour Party, they have played benefits for War Child, Amey cites an umbilical link to the political stance of punk bands such as Black Flag, and after their last tour, Oddie and Ellis volunteered at a London food bank. They are forthright, too, on the Government’s treatment of the arts sector during the pandemic — the lack of support for venues and festivals, the financial hardship for many touring musicians and crew. ‘There’s a billion-pound industry in the festival economy,’ Ellis points out. ‘But I understand in a pandemic the priority has to be health, and it’s difficult to attack someone, the Tories, in a significant health crisis. So it’s a catch-22 at the moment.’
As one of the UK’s most successful young bands, they have perhaps fared better through the pandemic than most. As Ellis points out: ‘Everyone was universally impacted, everyone has had their timeline stretched.’ But still, they are conscious that with live music still restricted, festivals looking precarious, most musicians will struggle to make enough to survive on streaming alone.
‘It’s been going on for ages, that type of stuff,’ he continues. ‘Independent venues have been threatened since I was a child. I’ve just seen in Germany a lot of venues are being turned into cultural institutions, which I think is a phenomenal idea. I understand that people need places to live, and populations are expanding, but some of the formative musical moments in all of our lives have happened in small gig spaces around the UK. They’re under threat. There has got to be significant financial layout and investment into how to keep those things going.’

They worry about the future of festivals, how well they can possibly survive to next year without government support. Two days after we meet, the band will head to Somerset to record a set for this year’s Glastonbury — it is ‘an honour’, they say, to have been included on the live-stream line-up, which will serve as a substitute festival in this second pandemic year. The band join Coldplay, Haim, Michael Kiwanuka and others, playing not for a muddy live crowd but an online audience of millions. It will be an opportunity to play their new songs live for the first time.
Blue Weekend marks a new kind of confidence for Rowsell as a songwriter. Its lyrics bolder, more open, more unflinching, their subject-matter ranging from relationships to self-love to a furious riposte to those who seek to diminish her: ‘If you don’t like me,’ she sings on ‘Smile’, ‘that isn’t fucking relevant.’
‘I think the way that I’ve been more open is not necessarily that I’ve been more confessional, it’s been more that in the past if I felt it was a bit embarrassing then I would shroud it in ambiguity,’ she explains. ‘And now I’m like, no: I’m going to step out of my comfort zone.’
It isn’t only Rowsell who has grown into herself. ‘I’m now The Hot One,’ jokes Amey. ‘And I’m The Grey Man of Wolf Alice,’ adds Oddie, though it is true that all four now inhabit their roles readily. When they won the Mercury, Ellis took the microphone from a stunned Rowsell and, nine beers deep, recalled how at their first meeting with a record label they were told they didn’t look like a band.

Today they look like a band. ‘It’s confidence that comes from experience more than success,’ Ellis says. ‘Success can spook you, if anything. But experience is invaluable. I watch us — even when we’re doing something like a photo shoot, I see everyone knowing what works for them. It’s one of the funnest things about being in a band in a way, watching people grow. I’d struggle to pinpoint when that confidence happened — it’s still happening, we’re still growing, we’re still trying things we might not have done.’
They were in Belgium making Blue Weekend when the pandemic arrived. Faced with the choice of continuing to record or returning to the UK, they chose to stay. Another two months passed in the isolation of the studio before they made their way back, and as strange and unwelcome as the circumstances were, they credit this extra time with providing the album’s astonishing maturity and polish.
Of late they have noticed how their peers are beginning to settle down. ‘The last few months I feel loads of people have said they’re having babies,’ says Ellis. He smiles, and pulls at his pink neckerchief. ‘Not for us, though.’

Following their Mercury win it was rumoured that Rowsell was settling down — the day after the awards ceremony, The Sun reported that she was engaged to Slaves frontman, Isaac Holman, and the pair had bought a house in Margate. ‘I don’t know where they got that,’ she says. She received so many congratulatory messages on her supposed engagement that she began to wonder more about all the people who hadn’t bothered to congratulate her. The rumour, she hastens to add, was entirely made up and the pair are no longer together. ‘But my family believed it,’ she sighs.",2021-05-27T15:55:10Z,https://www.standard.co.uk,Evening Standard

""Sr. Warner, seu agente e advogado estão cientes do mandado há algum tempo e nenhum esforço foi feito por eles para retornar a New Hampshire e responder às acusações pendentes"", diz a publicação que se refere ao cantor pelo seu nome verdadeiro, Brian Warner.
O advogado de Manson disse à NBC News que a acusação é ""ridícula"", mas que eles estão comprometidos em cooperar com as autoridades. ""Não é segredo para ninguém que assistiu a um show do Marilyn Manson que ele gosta de ser provocador no palco, especialmente na frente de uma câmera"", afirmou Howard King.

Marilyn Manson viene involucrado en denuncias
Cabe resaltar que, desde hace unos meses, Marilyn Manson viene involucrado en diversas denuncias. Esmé Bianco y Evan Rachel Wood son algunas de las actrices que lo han acusado de agredirlas psicológica y sexualmente.
“El nombre de mi abusador es Brian Warner, también conocido en el mundo como Marilyn Manson. Comenzó a prepararme cuando era un adolescente y abusó horriblemente de mí durante años”, señaló la actriz de Westword.",2021-05-27T05:00:00Z,https://elpopular.pe,ElPopular.pe
Emiten una orden de arresto contra Marilyn Manson por agresión en Estados Unidos,"La policía de estado de Nuevo Hampshire ha emitido una orden judicial de arresto contra el cantante Marilyn Manson por agresión, en relación con un incidente con una reportera de TV en un concierto en agosto de 2019, informaron este miércoles los medios estadounidenses.
La policía indicó este martes que la orden lleva en vigor desde octubre de 2019, pero señaló que pese a las repetidas notificaciones a Manson, cuyo nombre real es Brian Warner, el cantante no ha regresado a ese estado a hacer frente a los cargos por dos delitos menores.
La nota policial publicada en Facebook remarcó que la emisión de esa orden no “es una presunción de culpabilidad” y que los cargos no “son por delitos de carácter sexual”, dado que Warner ha enfrentado varias acusaciones al respecto recientemente.
Los cargos podrían acarrear cada uno una multa de 2.000 dólares y hasta un año de cárcel. Por su parte, el abogado del músico, Howard King, señaló en un comunicado enviado a la revista People que no es un “secreto” que “a Manson le gusta ser provocador en escena”.
Manson, de 52 años, es una de las grandes estrellas del metal y del lado más siniestro del rock en las últimas décadas, con éxitos como “Sweet Dreams” y “The Beautiful People”.
Según explicó King, el cargo contra Manson se presentó a raíz de la demanda que puso una camarógrafa por recibir en el brazo un escupitajo del cantante. Pidieron “pruebas de los daños” y “nunca” obtuvieron respuesta, añadió.
Para el abogado, toda la demanda es “absurda”, pero agregó que “cooperarán” con las autoridades.Manson enfrenta, por otro lado, acusaciones de abusos sexuales por la actriz Evan Rachel Wood, quien fuera su pareja durante un tiempo, y por otras cuatro mujeres.
El cantante negó estas acusaciones por considerarlas “horribles distorsiones de la realidad” y sostuvo además que todas sus relaciones íntimas fueron “consentidas”.

Em 18 de agosto daquele ano, Manson fez um show no local. De acordo com a polícia, as acusações estão relacionadas a essa apresentação e envolvem um cinegrafista contratado por uma empresa local para gravar o show. Manson teria cuspido no cinegrafista, mas a polícia não detalhou as ocorrências.
O mandado de prisão foi emitido em 8 de outubro de 2019, mas só se tornou público nesta terça (25), em comunicado que a Polícia de Gilford publicou em seu Facebook.
""Sr. Warner, seu agente e advogado estão cientes do mandado há algum tempo e nenhum esforço foi feito por eles para retornar a New Hampshire e responder às acusações pendentes"", diz a publicação que se refere ao cantor pelo seu nome verdadeiro, Brian Warner.

De acordo com a polícia, Manson pode ser condenado a uma sentença de menos de um ano na prisão e a uma multa de US$ 2.000 (R$ 10 mil) ou menos.
Nos últimos meses, diversas mulheres acusaram Manson de assédio, estupro e agressão. Ex-noiva do cantor, a atriz Evan Rachel Wood, 33, disse que ele começou a assediá-la quando ela ainda era adolescente. ""Ele abusou terrivelmente de mim por anos"", afirmou a atriz.
Segundo a Vanity Fair, além da atriz, outras quatro mulheres que afirmam ter tido relações afetivas com o cantor também acusaram o artista de manipulação, assédio e abusos. Uma delas, que esteve com Marilyn Manson em 2015 também menciona vários estupros.
Manson se posicionou em suas redes sociais no início de fevereiro. ""Obviamente minha arte e minha vida sempre foram ímãs para polêmica, mas essas afirmações recentes sobre mim são horríveis distorções da realidade"", escreveu em seu Instagram.
""Meus relacionamentos íntimos sempre foram totalmente consensuais com companheiras que pensam como eu. Independentemente de como, e por quê, outras estão optando hoje por manipular o passado, esta é a verdade"", completou o artista.",2021-05-26T22:09:00Z,https://www.tnh1.com.br,TNH1
Marilyn Manson Arrest Warrant Issued In New Hampshire,"Marilyn Manson has a warrant out for his arrest in New Hampshire, which was reportedly first issued back in October 2019, for an incident that occurred at a concert in August of the same year.
Officials say that Manson and his team have been aware of the warrant for quite some time, but have yet to do anything about it, or try to get it resolved, despite having been in contact since the warrant was first issued.

Manson is wanted for two counts of Class A misdemeanor simple assault, apparently due to him spitting (quite aggressively) directly into a camera lens. The footage from the camera in question was being shown on the big screen of the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion. After he spat, some of the spit allegedly landed on the videographer handling the camera, leading to these charges. Manson is a controversial figure known to do extreme things in the name of his art, making this particular event no surprise-- and even possibly tame.
Although the alleged victim was left with “no injuries,” Manson is still being charged as the stray saliva made “unprivileged physical contact.” The videographer, who was contracted by the venue, was working in the pit area when the spitting incident occurred, leaving Manson to face New Hampshire punishments, such as a net less-than-a-year jail sentence or a $2000 fine if prosecuted.
This isn’t the only allegation Manson is facing at the moment, as he is currently being sued by his former assistant. Find out why here.

""Brian Hugh Warner così come il suo agente e il suo avvocato, è a conoscenza da tempo del mandato di cattura pendente su di lui, ma non ha fatto alcuno sforzo per tornare nel New Hampshire e rispondere alle accuse"", ha scritto il Dipartimento di polizia su Facebook. Il mandato di arresto sarebbe attivo fin dall'ottobre 2019.
Nel corso di un concerto tenuto da Marilyn Manson il 18 agosto 2019 presso il New Hampshire Pavilion a Gilford, il cantante avrebbe sputato sull'obiettivo di una camera usata per proiettare le immagini sul palco. E l'addetto video dietro il proiettore sarebbe stato colpito da parte della saliva del Reverendo. Da qui è partita la denuncia contro Manson. Secondo un portavoce della polizia, l'uomo non avrebbe riportato ferite ma l'accusa riguarda un ""contatto fisico non richiesto"".
Il legale del cantante, Howard King ha dichiarato: ""Non è un segreto per chiunque abbia assistito a un concerto di Marilyn Manson che gli piace provocare sul palco, soprattutto davanti a una telecamera"", e ha spiegato: ""Questo reclamo per reato è stato portato avanti dopo che abbiamo ricevuto una richiesta da un videomaker locale per oltre 35mila dollari dopo che una piccola quantità di saliva è entrata in contatto con il suo braccio. Abbiamo chiesto prove di eventuali presunti danni, ma non abbiamo mai ricevuto una risposta"".",2021-05-26T22:00:00Z,https://www.tgcom24.mediaset.it,TGCOM

Anthony Burpee, chef de la police de Gilford, a refusé d'en dévoiler plus, mais l'avocat du musicien, Howard King, a révélé qu'un photographe avait réclamé 35 000 $ de dommages et intérêt après «qu'un petit peu de salive soit entré en contact avec son bras».

La policía de estado de Nuevo Hampshire ha emitido una orden judicial de arresto contra el famoso artista Marilyn Manson por agresión, en relación con un incidente con una reportera de TV en un concierto en agosto de 2019, informaron este miércoles los medios de Estados Unidos.
La policía indicó este martes que la orden lleva en vigor desde octubre del 2019, pero señaló que pese a las repetidas notificaciones a Marilyn Manson, cuyo nombre real es Brian Warner, el cantante no ha regresado a ese estado a hacer frente a los cargos por dos delitos menores.
La nota policial publicada en Facebook remarcó que la emisión de esa orden no ""es una presunción de culpabilidad"" y que los cargos no ""son por delitos de carácter sexual"", dado que el intérprete de metal ha enfrentado varias acusaciones al respecto recientemente.
Los cargos podrían acarrear cada uno una multa de 2.000 dólares y hasta un año de cárcel. Por su parte, el abogado del músico, Howard King, señaló en un comunicado enviado a la revista People que no es un ""secreto"" que ""a Manson le gusta ser provocador en escena"".
Marilyn Manson, de 52 años, es una de las grandes estrellas del metal y del lado más siniestro del rock en las últimas décadas, con éxitos como ""Sweet Dreams"" y ""The Beautiful People"".
Según explicó King, el cargo contra el músico de metal se presentó a raíz de la demanda que puso una camarógrafa por recibir en el brazo un escupitajo del cantante. Pidieron ""pruebas de los daños"" y ""nunca"" obtuvieron respuesta, añadió. Para su defensa, toda la demanda es ""absurda"", pero agregó que ""cooperarán"" con las autoridades.
Enfrenta acusaciones de abuso sexual
Cabe recordar que, Marilyn Manson enfrenta, por otro lado, acusaciones de abusos sexuales por la actriz Evan Rachel Wood, quien fuera su pareja durante un tiempo, y por otras cuatro mujeres. El cantante negó estas acusaciones por considerarlas ""horribles distorsiones de la realidad"" y sostuvo además que todas sus relaciones íntimas fueron ""consentidas"". (EFE)

O caso veio à tona na noite de 3ª feira (25.mai.2021) depois que o departamento de polícia publicou que Manson está sendo procurado no perfil da polícia da cidade no Facebook. Brian Hugh Warner, como ele é chamado pela polícia, é o nome legal de Manson.
Ainda de acordo com a polícia de Gilford, Manson e seus advogados já estão cientes de que há um mandado de prisão “há algum tempo“. Apesar disso, “nenhum esforço foi feito por ele para retornar a New Hampshire para responder às acusações pendentes“.
O tabloide TMZ obteve imagens da suposta agressão. Manson cuspiu no cinegrafista que gravava seu show. Segundo a polícia afirmou ao TMZ, o cinegrafista não se feriu, mas cuspir em uma pessoa é considerado uma agressão, já que é um “contato físico não privilegiado“.
No anuncio no Facebook, o departamento de polícia fez questão de dizer que a natureza das acusações não eram sexuais. Manson é acusado de assédio sexual por duas atrizes norte-americanas. Ele nega.

Marilyn Manson n'a pas fini de faire parler de lui. Déjà dans le collimateur de la justice pour des faits de violences conjugales, voilà que le chanteur est rattrapé par un nouveau scandale. Dans un message partagé sur Facebook ce mardi 25 mai, la police de l'État américain du New Hampshire révèle que l'artiste de 52 ans est visé par un mandat d'arrêt et que deux chefs d'accusation ""d'agression simple"" pèsent sur lui. Ceux-ci font suite à un incident qui se serait déroulé en août 2019, en marge d'un de ses concerts au Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion et qui impliquerait un caméraman. Selon le New York Times, le mandat d'arrêt daterait du 8 octobre 2019.
Si Brian Hugh Warner, de son vrai nom, a bien été mis au courant de cette action judiciaire, cela fait maintenant deux ans qu'il continue à l'ignorer : ""Aucun effort n'a été fait de son côté pour revenir au New Hampshire afin de répondre aux accusations en cours"" peut-on lire dans le message, rendu public par les autorités dans le but de faire réagir le rockeur. Ce dernier s'est pour l'heure bien gardé de tout commentaire à ce sujet.
Marilyn Manson déjà accusé d'agressions sexuelles par ses ex-compagnes
A noter que Marilyn Manson fait déjà l'objet de graves accusations depuis le mois de février dernier. C'est son ex-compagne, la comédienne Evan Rachel Wood qui a été la première à sortir de son silence afin de lever le voile sur les terribles sévices dont elle aurait été victime de la part de la star : ""Il m'a lavé le cerveau et manipulée jusqu'à la soumission. Je refuse de continuer à vivre dans la peur de représailles, diffamation ou chantage. Je suis là pour révéler la nature de cet homme dangereux et pour exposer les nombreuses industries qui lui permettent de continuer, avant qu'il ne ruine d'autres vies."" avait-elle raconté. Son témoignage a été suivi par celui des actrices Esmé Bianco, Ashley Morgan Smithline mais aussi de celui d'une ancienne assistante, Ashley Walters. Toutes accusent le chanteur d'agressions sexuelles, de viol, de harcélement et de violences répétées. Autant de faits que nie fermement Marilyn Manson qui affirme que ces rapports étaient consentis.

JUSTICE - Les ennuis judiciaires s’accumulent pour Marilyn Manson. Alors qu’il est sous le coup de deux plaintes pour viol, la police du New Hampshire annonce qu’un mandat d’arrêt a été lancé contre le rockeur, accusé d’avoir craché sur une jeune femme qui le filmait pendant un concert, en 2019.
Marilyn Manson remontera-t-il un jour sur scène ? Dans le New Hampshire, il est en tout cas attendu de pied ferme par les forces de l’ordre. Ce mardi, la police de la ville de Gilford a publié en ligne un message révélant que le rockeur de 52 ans était sous le coup d’un mandat d’arrêt, suite à des faits remontant à l’été 2019. Lors d’un concert au Bank of New Hampshire pavilion, dans le cadre de la tournée ""Hell Never Dies"" avec son collègue Rob Zombie, le chanteur s’en serait pris à une vidéaste qui le filmait pour une agence locale. ""Il crachait partout et à un moment elle a été obligée d’essuyer sa caméra"", raconte un témoin des faits au magazine People. ""Elle était énervée et il l’a remarqué. Alors il a recommencé.""
Elle était écoeurée et elle a quitté la salle tandis qu’il était mort de rire - Un témoin, cité par le magazine ""People""
Toujours d’après ce témoin, Marilyn Manson finira par descendre de scène pour se rapprocher de la jeune femme et souiller son objectif devant l’assistance. ""Elle était écœurée et elle a quitté la salle tandis qu’il était mort de rire"", relate encore cette personne. Dans son message, la police du New Hampshire précise avoir contacté, en vain, les représentants légaux du rockeur pour qu’il s’explique des faits passibles d’un an de prison au maximum et d’une amende de 2000 dollars. Elle prend par ailleurs soin de préciser qu'aucun délit à caractère sexuel n'a été commis.
""Pour quiconque ayant assisté à un concert de Marilyn Manson, ce n’est pas un secret qu’il aime se montrer provocateur sur scène, en particulier devant un objectif"", a réagi mardi Howard King, l’avocat du chanteur. ""Cette accusation d’agression intervient après que nous avons reçu une demande de la vidéaste nous réclamant 35.000 dollars pour une goutte de bave sur son bras. Nous lui avons demandé d’en apporter la preuve, ce qu’elle n’a jamais fait.""
L’affaire pourrait paraitre anecdotique si elle n’intervenait au moment où Marilyn Manson, de son vrai nom Brian Warner, est dans l’œil du cyclone depuis que son ex-compagne, l’actrice Evan Rachel Wood, l’a accusé d’agression sexuelle et psychologique dans un message posté sur Instagram début février. Depuis, la comédienne britannique Esmé Bianco et l’ex-assistante du chanteur, Ashley Walters, ont déposé plainte pour viol contre lui. Marilyn Manson, qui nie les faits qui lui sont reprochés, vit désormais reclus dans sa maison de Hollywood Hills avec Lindsay Usich, la photographe qu’il a épousé l’an dernier. Le rockeur a été lâché par le label qui a publié son dernier album, We are chaos, tandis que son manager et l’agence gérant sa carrière d’acteur ont mis fin à leur collaboration. Il a également été supprimé des épisodes de deux séries dans lesquelles il venait de tourner.

La policía emite una orden de arresto contra Marilyn Manson por agredir a una operadora de cámara,"La policía del Estado de New Hampshire, al noroeste de Estados Unidos, ha emitido este martes una orden de arresto contra el cantante Marilyn Manson por la presunta agresión a una operadora de cámara en agosto de 2019. Un delito que, según la legislación del Estado, puede acarrear una pena de cárcel de hasta un año y una sanción de hasta 1.635 euros.
La orden de arresto contra Manson se ha hecho pública en el perfil de Facebook del cuerpo policial de Gilford, que señala que tanto el artista como su agente y su asesor legal conocen dicha orden desde hace tiempo, pero “no han hecho ningún esfuerzo por volver a New Hampshire y responder a los cargos pendientes”. “La policía de Gilford tiene una orden de arresto activa contra Brian Hugh Warner [más conocido como Marilyn Manson] por dos delitos de agresión relativos a un incidente ocurrido en 2019 en el Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion”, señala la publicación, acompañada de una fotografía del vocalista. Por el momento, el representante de Manson no ha hecho comentarios al respecto.
El incidente ocurrió, según señalan los agentes, el 18 de agosto de 2019, cuando Manson dio un concierto en el New Hampshire Pavilion. La operadora de cámara había sido subcontratada por una compañía local para grabar la actuación y se encontraba en el foso del escenario cuando fue presuntamente agredida.
Según ha asegurado el abogado de Manson, Howard King, a la revista People, la acusación por este delito llega tras “haber recibido una demanda de la operadora de cámara por más de 35.000 dólares [más de 28.600 euros], después de que una pequeña cantidad de saliva entrara en contacto con su brazo”. En dichas declaraciones, King ha añadido que, “después de haber reclamado evidencias del daño” denunciado, nunca recibieron una respuesta. “No es un secreto para nadie que haya acudido a un concierto de Marilyn Manson que le gusta ser provocador en el escenario, especialmente cuando hay cámaras delante”, ha añadido el abogado, que asegura que “toda esta afirmación es ridícula”, pero que se comprometen a colaborar con las autoridades como, dicen, han hecho “en todo momento”.",2021-05-26T14:14:59Z,https://elpais.com,El País
Marilyn Manson tem mandado de prisão por cuspir em cinegrafista,"Depois de meses enfrentando acusações de abuso sexual por várias ex-namoradas e colaboradoras, Marilyn Manson ganhou mais uma dor de cabeça: a polícia de New Hampshire, Estados Unidos, tem um mandado de prisão em aberto contra o cantor, devido a um incidente com uma cinegrafista durante um show naquele estado.
O anúncio do mandado foi feito na noite de ontem, pelo departamento de polícia de Gilford. O artista de 52 anos, cujo nome real é Brian Warner, deve comparecer para responder pelos processos abertos contra ele contra a profissional que fazia a cobertura de um espetáculo seu naquela cidade.
""O Sr. Warner, seu agente e advogado estão cientes do mandado há algum tempo e nenhum esforço foi feito por ele para retornar a New Hampshire para responder às acusações pendentes"", diz o comunicado, publicado pela revista ""People"". ""A cinegrafista foi subcontratada por uma empresa com sede em New Hampshire para filmar o show, e estava localizado na área do fosso do palco quando os supostos ataques ocorreram"", prosseguiu.
O advogado de Manson, Howard King, disse para a revista que o processo foi aberto depois que a cinegrafista pediu cerca de 35 mil dólares (cerca de 186 mil reais em cotação atual) como compensação.
""Não é segredo para ninguém que assistiu a um show do Marilyn Manson que ele gosta de ser provocativo no palco, especialmente na frente de uma câmera. Esta ação judicial foi feita depois que recebemos um pedido de uma cinegrafista local de mais de 35 mil dólares depois que uma pequena quantidade de cuspe entrou em contato com o braço dela. Depois que pedimos evidências de quaisquer danos alegados, nunca recebemos uma resposta"", declarou o advogado.
Ele continuou: ""Toda essa afirmação é ridícula, mas continuamos comprometidos em cooperar com as autoridades, como sempre fizemos"".
Testemunhas confirmam agressão
No entanto, três testemunhas disseram para a ""People"" que presenciaram o momento em que Manson cuspiu de propósito na cinegrafista. ""Ele estava cuspindo em todos os lugares e uma vez caiu na câmera dele, então ele limpou e parecia semi-irritado. Ele percebeu isso e continuou cuspindo de propósito na câmera dele"", disse uma das presentes na cena.
A testemunha acrescentou: ""Acho que a gota d'água foi que ele deitou no chão, ficou a cerca de 1 metro dela e disparou um 'foguete' gigante contra ele, não a câmera. Ele ficou irritado e enojado, então saiu disparada e ele apenas riu. Eu parei de ouvir sua música depois disso e disse ao meu marido que nunca iria a outro de seus shows novamente"".
Uma segunda testemunha corroborou as afirmações: ""Ele se abaixou para escarrar em cima dessa mulher. Lembro-me dele apenas rindo do que fez"". A terceira testemunha, um segurança do show, também confirmou as acusações.
""Eu estava lá quando aconteceu, ela ficou furiosa quando ele fez isso com ela"", disse um terceiro homem, que trabalha como segurança no local, segundo postagem em seu Facebook. ""Ele cuspiu nela algumas vezes e então se inclinou bem perto da câmera e cuspiu um 'foguete' enorme de meleca nela. Depois que ele fez isso, ela quase jogou a câmera no chão"", explicou.
O mandado de prisão contra Manson vem meses depois das diversas acusações de abuso sexual contra o roqueiro, que abalaram fortemente a sua carreira e reputação no mundo da música.",2021-05-26T14:05:00Z,https://www.uol.com.br,UOL
Marilyn Manson spyttet på kvinnelig fotograf under konsert: - Han lo av henne,"Utsendt arrestordre på rockeren etter konsert.
I denne saken finner du noen av de mest aktuelle kjendis-snakkisene fra inn- og utland akkurat nå.
De siste månedene har det stormet rundt den amerikanske rockeren Marilyn Manson (52), etter at eksforloveden, skuespiller Evan Rachel Wood (33), i januar sto frem med anklager om vold og seksuelle overgrep.
I etterkant har flere av hans tidligere kjærester anklaget ham for både voldtekt, vold, og seksuelle overgrep.
Nå er 52-åringen i trøbbel igjen.
Tirsdag kveld kunngjorde nemlig politiet i Gilford i New Hampshire at de har en aktiv arrestordre på rockeren, etter at han skal ha spyttet på en kvinnelig fotograf under en konsert, skriver People.
Ifølge politiet har Manson og hans advokater vært klar over tiltalen i lengre tid, men ikke gjort noe forsøk på å returnere til New Hampshire for å svare på anklagene. Fotografen det er snakk om skal ha vært innleid for å filme konserten, og oppholdt seg i sceneområdet da de påståtte overgrepene skjedde.

I en uttalelse til nettstedet sier Mansons advokat, Howard King, at arrestordren skal ha kommet etter at fotografen ba om 35.000 kroner i erstatning for kamerautstyret.
- Det er ingen hemmelighet for noen som har deltatt på en Marilyn Manson-konsert at han liker å være provoserende på scenen, spesielt foran et kamera, sier King i en uttalelse til People.
- Vi mottok et krav fra en videograf for mer enn 35.000 dollar etter at en liten mengde spytt kom i kontakt med armen. Etter at vi ba om bevis for påståtte skader, fikk vi aldri svar.

Overfor People forteller et vitne at Manson spyttet «overalt» under konserten, før han siktet seg inn på fotografen og traff kameraet:
- Hun tørket det av, men ble ganske irritert. Han la merke til det og fortsatt å spytte på kameraet hennes. Jeg tror det verste var da han kom ned på gulvet og sto bare et par meter unna henne og spyttet på henne, ikke kameraet. Hun ble forbanna og stormet ut, mens han sto igjen og lo av henne, forteller vitnet til People.

Aniston og Pitt var gift da han dukket opp som en av Rachels tidligere klassekamerater i serien. Selv om han bare var bare med i én episode, ble Pitt nominert til en «Emmy» for rollen.
Paret begynte å date i 1998 og giftet seg i 2000. Men forholdet slo sprekker etter at Pitt forelsket seg i Angelina Jolie under innspillingen av «Mr. & Mrs. Smith» noen år senere. Bruddet var et av de mer skitne i Hollywood, og i 2005 var skilsmissen et faktum.

Howard King, a lawyer for Manson, told the New York Times (NYT) that a venue videographer had asked for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm.
“After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply,” he added.
Describing the claim as “ludicrous” he said “we remain committed to cooperating with authorities as we have done throughout.”
The arrest warrant was issued in October 2019, according to the NYT.
Manson had been performing a concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion two months prior when the alleged assaults occurred in the stage pit area, police said in a statement on Facebook.

The videographer had been subcontracted by a company based in New Hampshire to video the concert, the statement added.
Anthony Burpee, chief of the Gilford Police Department, said that the warrant was publicised “simply because we’ve been attempting to clear the warrant since it was issued,” with no response from Manson or his lawyer.
“In light of other recent allegations,” he added – apparently referencing recent claims of domestic abuse and sexual assault made against Manson – law enforcement wanted the singer “to take care of his business” in New Hampshire “so that he and we can move forward”.
The development marks the latest controversy to surround the rock singer.
In February, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said that authorities were investigating allegations of domestic violence by Manson.
He was dropped by his record label after four women said in social media posts that Manson had abused them.
In April, Game of Thrones actress Esme Bianco sued Manson for physical, sexual and emotional abuse, claiming that the rocker “chased her with an axe.”
Manson has denied the allegations.
Speaking on Instagram, he denied Ms Wood’s claims and said recent claims about him were “horrible distortions of reality.”
A representative of Manson was not immediately available for comment.
The singer songwriter is known for his Gothic-inspired black outfits and heavy make-up. His hits include “The Dope Show” and “Personal Jesus”.
The alleged assaults were not sexual in nature, the police said, adding that the issuance of an arrest warrant was not a presumption of guilt.",2021-05-26T13:43:39Z,https://www.standard.co.uk,Evening Standard

Manson, 52, who was a somewhat controversial public figure ever since his introduction into mainstream media, has had several run-ins with allegations of assault and abuse.
In February, several allegations of domestic violence were brought forth by multiple women in Los Angeles.
The alleged abuse took place between 2009 and 2011 while Manson was living in West Hollywood, according to the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department.
The investigation into the alleged domestic abuse came weeks after actress Evan Rachel Wood named Manson as her former abuser on social media. Wood's claims prompted several other women to come forward with similar allegations.

The ongoing controversy resulted in Manson being dropped from his record label, Loma Vista Recordings. He was also removed from two television roles in Starz's ""American Gods"" and AMC's ""Creepshow.""
In response to the allegations in February, Manson wrote on Instagram that they were ""horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.""
""Game of Thrones"" actor Esmé Bianco sued Marilyn Manson on April 30, alleging sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Bianco says that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England under the false pretenses of roles in music videos and movies that never materialized.
The lawsuit alleges Manson deprived Bianco of food and sleep, though gave her alcohol and drugs, locked her in a bedroom, whipped her, gave her electric shocks, tried to force her to have sex with another woman and threatened to enter her room and rape her during the night.

Marilyn Manson wanted on arrest warrant in New Hampshire for assault,"Marilyn Manson performs during the Twins Of Evil - The Second Coming Tour Opener at DTE Energy Music Theater on July 11, 2018 in Clarkston, Michigan.
Police in New Hampshire say they have an arrest warrant for Marilyn Manson.
In a Facebook post Tuesday, the Gilford Police Department said the musician was wanted in connection to a misdemeanor assault that allegedly took place in 2019.
The police said the two counts of misdemeanor simple assaults are related to an incident that took place at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion that involved a videographer. Manson performed a concert at that venue on Aug. 18, 2019 when the alleged assault occurred.
It is unclear what transpired during the concert, but the videographer, who was subcontracted by a New Hampshire company to record the concert, was in the stage pit area when the alleged assault took place, police said.
""Mr. Warner, his agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the pending charges,"" the police department said.
Brian Warner is Manson's real name. Manson's attorney told NBC that the claim was ""ludicrous"" and that they are committed to cooperating with local authorities.

""After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply,"" King said.
This arrest warrant comes as Manson is already shrouded in controversy. The musician has been accused of abuse by two former romantic partners, Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco. Manson has broadly denied these charges.
The special victims bureau of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office began investigating the domestic violence allegations against Manson in February.

"""Sputa"" addosso a un'operatrice video: Marilyn Manson ricercato nel New Hampshire","GILFORD, NH - La polizia di una cittadina del New Hampshire ha reso noto di aver spiccato un mandato di arresto a carico di Marilyn Manson, al secolo Brian Hugh Warner. Il cantante è accusato di aggressione ai danni di un'operatrice video avvenuta nel'agosto del 2019 durante un suo concerto laggiù.
«Il signor Warner, il suo agente e il suo legale sono a conoscenza del mandato da qualche tempo, ma lui non ha fatto alcuno sforzo per tornare nel New Hampshire e rispondere delle imputazioni pendenti», fa sapere il Dipartimento di polizia di Gilford rendendo noto l'ordine di cattura su Facebook (vedi più sotto). La presunta aggressione, precisano gli inquirenti, «non è di natura sessuale, come è stato chiesto da diversi organi d'informazione a causa di una certa quantità di querele presentate contro il signor Warner».
Il riferimento è alle accuse di violenze sessuali recentemente presentate da diverse donne contro il 52enne. La presunta aggressione nel New Hampshire, invece, sarebbe piuttosto di natura muco-salivare.
Come riferisce People, infatti, durante la sua esibizione Manson avrebbe sputato e persino spruzzato del muco nasale addosso alla presunta vittima, un'operatrice video intenta a filmare il concerto dalla fossa davanti al palco.
«Sputava ovunque e, a un certo punto, (la sua saliva, ndr) è finita sulla videocamera, lei l'ha pulita e sembrava semi-irritata. Lui l'ha notato e ha continuato a sputare apposta sulla telecamera», ha raccontato al portale d'informazione americano una spettatrice. «Penso che la goccia che ha fatto traboccare il vaso sia stata che lui si è steso sul pavimento, è arrivato a 60-90 centimetri da lei e ha sparato uno schizzo di moccio gigantesco su di lei, non sulla telecamera - ha continuato -. Lei, disgustata, si è arrabbiata e se ne è andata e lui si è semplicemente messo a ridere».
Anche la ricostruzione dell'avvocato di Manson riferisce sostanzialmente di una fattispecie simile a quella descritta da questa testimone oculare. «Non è un segreto per nessuno che abbia partecipato a un concerto di Marilyn Manson che gli piace provocare sul palco, specialmente davanti a una telecamera», ha dichiarato in una presa di posizione inviata a People il legale del cantante, Howard King. A suo avviso, la querela contro il suo assistito sarebbe stata depositata dopo che la presunta vittima avrebbe chiesto 35'000 dollari d'indennizzo perché «una piccola quantità di sputo è entrata in contatto con il suo braccio»: «Dopo che abbiamo chiesto le prove di eventuali danni non abbiamo più ricevuto risposta», sostiene King.
Se riconosciuto colpevole di aggressione semplice, Marilyn Manson rischia fino a un anno di carcere e 2'000 dollari di multa, fa sapere il Dipartimento di polizia di Gilford.",2021-05-26T13:00:00Z,https://www.tio.ch,20 minuti Ticino

GILFORD, New Hampshire (WJW/AP) — There is an active arrest warrant for Canton native, Marilyn Manson, for two counts of simple assault dating back to 2019.
According to a post by Gilford Police Department, Manson, originally Brian Hugh Warner, was charged after being accused of assaulting a videographer in a stage pit area while performing a concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion on Aug. 18, 2019.
Police say the alleged assaults are not sexual in nature.
People reports that Manson’s attorney, Howard King, said the charges were filed after the videographer asked for $35,000 for “effects on camera equipment.”
King said the request was made after “a small amount of spit came into contact” with the videographer’s arm. He said after asking for evidence regarding the claim, they did not get a reply.
“This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout,” King told People.
However, concert attendees told People that Manson also “blew a huge snot rocket” on the videographer.
The Facebook post states Manson’s agent and legal counsel have been made aware of the warrant for some time but no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the charges.
A misdemeanor simple assault charge carries a possible jail sentence of less than one year and a fine of $2,000 or less.
Earlier this month, “Game of Thrones” actor Esmé Bianco sued Manson, alleging sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Bianco says that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England under the false pretenses of roles in music videos and movies that never materialized.
In February, Bianco was one of several women who spoke out after actor Evan Rachel Wood said on social media that Manson sexually, physically and emotionally abused her during their relationship. Manson’s record label and agents dropped him at the time.
In response to the allegations in February, Manson wrote on Instagram that they were “horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how — and why — others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”
Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives also said in February that they were investigating domestic violence allegations against Manson dating from 2009 to 2011 in West Hollywood. They did not identify the woman who made the report.",2021-05-26T12:03:51Z,https://fox8.com,WJW FOX 8 News Cleveland

A equipa de advogados de Ashley Walters registou uma reclamação na Califórnia. A equipa alegou que o cantor era um chefe assustador e violento, que disse aos amigos que podiam tocar e beijar Ashley Walters, e obrigou-a a trabalhar durante 48 horas seguidas.
A equipa de Marilyn Manson ""negou veementemente qualquer acusação de agressão"".
Em fevereiro o cantor foi dispensado pela sua produtora, a Loma Vista Recordings, após acusações da atriz Evan Rachel Wood de que foi ""terrivelmente abusada"" pelo artista.
Marilyn Manson negou as acusações, ao dizer que são ""horríveis distorções da realidade"".",2021-05-26T11:59:00Z,https://www.dn.pt,Diário de Notícias - Lisboa

Cantor é acusado de agressões a cinegrafista contratado para gravar show
O Departamento de Polícia de Gilford, no estado de New Hampshire (EUA), afirmou nesta terça (25) ter um mandado de prisão contra Marilyn Manson. Segundo informado pela NBC News, o pedido de detenção do cantor envolve duas acusações de agressões ocorridas em 2019.
Em 18 de agosto daquele ano, Manson fez um show no local. Um cinegrafista contratado por uma empresa local para gravar a apresentação teria sido vítima de um suposto ataque do cantor, que teria cuspido nele.
O mandado de prisão foi emitido em 8 de outubro de 2019, mas só se tornou público nesta terça (25), em comunicado que a Polícia de Gilford publicou em seu Facebook.
""Sr. Warner, seu agente e advogado estão cientes do mandado há algum tempo e nenhum esforço foi feito por eles para retornar a New Hampshire e responder às acusações pendentes"", diz a publicação que se refere ao cantor pelo seu nome verdadeiro, Brian Warner.
O advogado de Manson disse à NBC News que a acusação é ""ridícula"", mas que eles estão comprometidos em cooperar com as autoridades.

The singer, whose given name is Brian Warner, is wanted on two counts of misdemeanor assault after an alleged incident involving a videographer during a concert at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion on August 18, 2019.
The 52-year-old's legal team has described the claims as ""ludicrous.""
Gilford Police Department in New Hampshire said the videographer had been hired to film the Manson concert and was in the stage pit area when the alleged assaults took place.
""The Gilford Police Department has an active arrest warrant for Brian Hugh Warner (aka: Marilyn Manson) for two counts of Class A misdemeanor Simple Assault stemming from a 2019 incident at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion,"" a police statement reads.
""The alleged assaults involved a videographer. Mr. Warner, his agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the pending charges.""
A Class A misdemeanor in New Hampshire can carry a possible jail sentence of less than one year and a fine of up to $2,000. The police statement says ""the issuance of an arrest warrant is not a presumption of guilt.""
The authorities have also clarified that the alleged assaults are ""not sexual in nature as has been asked by several other media outlets due to a number of other allegations made against Mr. Warner.""
Newsweek has reached out to Manson's legal team for comment.
The singer's lawyer, Howard King, told NME they were working with the authorities despite finding the claim ""ludicrous.""
King said: ""It is no secret to anyone who has attended a Marilyn Manson concert that he likes to be provocative on stage, especially in front of a camera.""
""This misdemeanor claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm. After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply.
""This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout.""
The news follows serious allegations made against Manson by a number of his previous partners, including actresses Evan Rachel Wood and Esme Bianco. He has denied the allegations.

Haftbefehl gegen Marilyn Manson wegen Rotzattacke,"Gegen Marilyn Manson (52) liegt in New Hampshire einen Haftbefehl vor, wie das Portal TMZ schreibt. Doch das hat nichts mit den Vorwürfen zu sexuellem Missbrauch gegen den Schock-Rocker zu tun. Er soll sich im Ostküstenstaat wegen tätlichen Angriffs vor Gericht verantworten – genauer gesagt: wegen eines tätlichen Spuck- und Rotz-Angriffs gegen eine Frau. Laut der Polizei der Stadt Gilford hatte Manson, der bürgerlich Brian Warner heisst, während eines Konzerts am 18. August 2019 im Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion eine Videografin ins Visier genommen. Die war offiziell vom Konzertveranstalter angeheuert worden, die Show direkt von vor der Bühne aufzuzeichnen.
Manson lachte nach Attacke
Laut Augenzeugen soll der Sänger «immer wieder in Richtung ihrer Kamera gespuckt» haben. Das zeigt auch eine Videoaufnahme vom Konzert. Als er dann von der Bühne sprang und direkt neben der Frau landete, habe er den Ekelangriff fortgesetzt. Ein Sicherheitsmann gab später zu Protokoll: «Er hat sich ein Nasenloch zugehalten, eine riesige Ladung Rotz auf sie geschnäuzt und direkt getroffen. Sie war stocksauer und ist geflüchtet. Manson hat nur gelacht.»
Laut eines Statements des Gilford Police Departments wurde Brian Hugh Warner wiederholt informiert, dass eine Anzeige wegen Körperverletzung gegen ihn vorliege: «Doch er hat keine Anstalten gemacht, nach New Hampshire zurückzukommen und sich den Vorwürfen zu stellen. Deshalb haben wir einen Haftbefehl gegen ihn beantragt.» Bei einer Verurteilung drohen Manson eine Haftstrafe von bis zu einem Jahr und eine Geldstrafe von rund 1800 Franken.

Marilyn Manson: Παραδόθηκε στις αρχές μετά από ένταλμα σύλληψης εναντίον του,"Παραδόθηκε στις αρχές ο Marilyn Manson καθώς εκκρεμούσε εις βάρος του ένταλμα σύλληψης στο Νιού Χάμσαϊρ μετά από καταγγελία για επίθεση σε κάμεραμαν το 2019.
Ο Manson, κατά κόσμο Μπράιαν Γουόρεν, παραδόθηκε στον αστυνομικό τμήμα του σερίφη του Λος Άντζελες στις 2 Ιουλίου μετά από συμφωνία που έγινε στα τέλη Ιουνίου μεταξύ του δικηγόρου του και των αρχών του Νιου Χάμσαϊρ σχετικά με το ένταλμα, όπως μετέδωσε το Hollywood Reporter. Στη συνέχεια αφέθηκε ελεύθερος χωρίς εγγύηση.
Η φερόμενη επίθεση έλαβε χώρα τον Αύγουστο του 2019 σε μια συναυλία στο Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion στο Gilford. Ο Marilyn Manson κατηγορείται για δύο πλημμελήματα που αφορούν σε απλή επίθεση. Εάν καταδικαστεί, αντιμετωπίζει πιθανή ποινή φυλάκισης και πρόστιμο έως 2.000 δολάρια.
Ο Howard King, δικηγόρος του Manson, σε δήλωση του σχετικά με το περιστατικό, είπε ότι στον Manson αρέσει να είναι «προκλητικός στη σκηνή, ειδικά μπροστά από την κάμερα».
«Η καταγγελία για το πλημμέλημα ακολούθησε καθώς ο εικονολήπτης που βιντεοσκοπούσε τη συναυλίας διεκδίκησε αθέμιτο ποσό άνω των 35.000 δολαρίων, όταν μικρή ποσότητα σάλιου (του Manson) ήρθε σε επαφή με το χέρι του (κάμεραμαν)», είπε ο King.
«Όλη αυτή η αξίωση είναι γελοία, αλλά παραμένουμε σταθεροί στη δέσμευσή μας να συνεργαστούμε με τις αρχές, όπως έχουμε κάνει καθ 'όλη τη διάρκεια» κατέληξε.
Εκτός από τις κατηγορίες για επίθεση, το αρμόδιο γραφείο του σερίφη του νομού Λος Άντζελες ερευνά τον Manson για φερόμενα περιστατικά ενδοοικογενειακής βίας που συνέβησαν μεταξύ 2009 και 2011 ενώ εκείνος ζούσε στο West Hollywood.
Τον Φεβρουάριο, η ηθοποιός Evan Rachel Wood κατηγόρησε τον Manson για «φρικτή» κακοποίηση όταν είχαν σχέση. Ακολούθησαν καταγγελίες εναντίον του από τέσσερις ακόμα γυναίκες. Ωστόσο εκείνος αρνείται τα πάντα.
Στον απόηχο των καταγγελιών αυτών, έληξε η συνεργασία του Μάνσον με την δισκογραφική του εταιρεία, το πρακτορείο του και το τηλεοπτικό σόου American Gods, στο οποίο συμμετείχε.

"Emiten una orden de arresto contra Marilyn Manson, que podría acabar en la cárcel","Emiten una orden de arresto contra Marilyn Manson, que podría acabar en la cárcel
El cantante afronta dos cargos de delito menor por agresión simple derivados de un incidente que ocurrió durante uno de sus conciertos en 2019.
El Departamento de Policía de Gilford (Nuevo Hampshire, EE.UU.) ha emitido una orden de arresto contra el cantante Marilyn Manson —nacido Brian Hugh Warner—, que podría acabar en la cárcel, según un comunicado publicado este martes en su cuenta oficial de Facebook.
En particular, el cantante afronta dos cargos de delito menor por agresión simple a raíz de un incidente ocurrido en uno de sus conciertos en agosto 2019, cuando agredió a un camarógrafo.
""El Sr. Warner, su agente y su asesor legal conocen la orden desde hace algún tiempo y no ha hecho ningún esfuerzo por regresar a New Hampshire para responder a los cargos pendientes"", reza el texto, que detalla que si la Justicia lo declara culpable podría enfrentarse a una pena de cárcel de un año como máximo y a una multa de hasta 2.000 dólares.
¿Qué pasó?
Según TMZ, el artista escupió a una cámara que grababa el concierto. El camarógrafo, que se encontraba cerca del escenario, alega que parte de la saliva cayó sobre su persona, indica el portal, que cita fuentes familiarizadas con el asunto.
Asimismo, detalla que el Departamento de Policía de Gilford les ha comunicado que, aunque la presunta víctima ""no sufrió lesiones"", acusa a Manson de haberlo agredido porque su acto —argumenta— supuso un ""contacto físico sin privilegios"".
Otras fuentes consultadas por TMZ han asegurado que tanto Manson como su equipo legal han permanecido en contacto con la Policía desde que ocurrió el incidente, hace alrededor de dos años.
Otras acusaciones
En 2018, la actriz estadounidense Charlyne Yi, conocida por su papel como la doctora Chi Park en la serie de televisión 'House' ('Doctor House', en América Latina), acusó al cantante estadounidense de acoso sexual durante el rodaje de la serie.
El pasado mes de febrero, la actriz estadounidense Evan Rachel Wood acusó a Manson de abuso sexual. A la denuncia se sumaron otras cuatro mujeres que también aseguran que fueron víctimas de violación y objeto de otras agresiones por parte del famoso vocalista de rock.
Poco días después, Wood denunció a la actual esposa del artista, Lindsay Usich, a la que acusa de haberla amenazado con publicar fotos comprometedoras que le hicieron cuando era adolescente y que podrían perjudicar su carrera.

GILFORD, N.H. (ABC4) – Police in New Hampshire have issued an arrest warrant for Marilyn Manson, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, for alleged simple assault.
Gilford Police say the warrant stems from a 2019 incident at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion. Manson had been performing at the pavilion on August 18, 2019, when the alleged assaults involving a videographer occurred.
The videographer, subcontracted by a New Hampshire-based company to video the concert, had been in the stage pit area when the alleged assaults occurred. Police say the allegations are not sexual in nature.
According to TMZ, Manson allegedly spit at the videographer.
“Mr. Warner, his agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer pending charges,” Gilford Police say.
Manson has been making headlines recently amid allegations of domesitc violence and abuse.
In February, the Associated Press reports detectives were investigating allegations against Manson in relation to incidents that occurred about a decade ago in West Hollywood. This came just weeks after Manson was dropped from his record label after his ex-fiancé Evan Rachel Wood accused him of sexual and other physical abuse.",2021-05-26T10:36:33Z,https://www.abc4.com,ABC 4
Marilyn Manson: active arrest warrant issued for alleged 2019 assault,"New Hampshire police have published a warrant for the arrest of Marilyn Manson on two counts of simple assault, regarding an incident involving a videographer at a concert in August 2019.
A warrant for his arrest was issued in October 2019, but despite repeat notifications, Manson (whose real name is Brian Warner) had not returned to New Hampshire to answer the charges, Gilford police department chief Anthony Burpee told the New York Times. The police declined to share details of the alleged incident with the newspaper.
Howard King, a lawyer for Manson, told the NYT that a venue videographer had asked for more than $35,000 “after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm. After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply.”
He described the claim as “ludicrous” and said “we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout”.
Burpee told the New York Times that the department was publicising the warrant “simply because we’ve been attempting to clear the warrant since it was issued” with no response from Manson or his representatives.
“In light of other recent allegations,” said Burpee – apparently referencing recent claims of sexual and domestic abuse made against Manson – law enforcement wanted the musician “to take care of his business” in the state “so that he and we can move forward”.
In February, Manson’s former partner, actor Evan Rachel Wood, claimed that Manson “horrifically abused” her and “started grooming me when I was a teenager”. Four other women made allegations including physical and emotional abuse, torture, rape and forced drug-taking.
In April, Game of Thrones actor Esmé Bianco sued Manson for sexual assault and sexual battery, alleging that he treated her violently when they lived together in 2011. This month, his former assistant Ashley Walters also filed a lawsuit accusing Manson of sexual assault and battery.
Manson has broadly denied the charges. In February, he responded to Wood’s claims in an Instagram post: “Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality. My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners. Regardless of how – and why – others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth.”
The special victims bureau of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office began investigating the domestic violence allegations against Manson in February. He was dropped by his record label, Loma Vista Recordings, and his appearance in an episode of fantasy drama American Gods was removed.",2021-05-26T10:33:11Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian

""The Gilford Police Department has an active arrest warrant for Brian Hugh Warner (aka: Marilyn Manson) for two counts of Class A misdemeanor,"" the Gilford Department stated in a Facebook post.
""The alleged assaults involved a videographer,"" it went on. ""Mr. Warner, his agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the pending charges.""
""Mr. Warner had been performing a concert at the Bank of NH Pavilion on August 18, 2019, when the alleged simple assaults occurred,"" detailed the post.
""The issuance of an arrest warrant is not a presumption of guilt,"" it went on. ""The videographer had been subcontracted by a NH-based company to video the concert, and had been located in the stage pit area when the alleged assaults occurred.""

Should Manson be found guilty, the Class A misdemeanor carries with it a possible jail sentence of less than one year and a fine of $2,000.
The allegationi refers to an unidentified videographer who claims Manson spit on their arm while they filmed his concert on August 18, 2019.
Police have said the assaults ""are not sexual in nature"" and that the videographer was in the piit at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion at the time of the concert.
Howard King, Manson's attorney, said the case was ""ludicrous,"" and disagreed with police, saying Manson had cooperated with police in their investigation.
“This misdemeanor claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm,"" King said in a statement.
""After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply,"" King added. “This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout.”

Arrest warrant issued against Marilyn Manson in assault case; singer denies charges,"is charged with two counts of misdemeanor simple assaul
An active arrest warrant has been issued for singer Marilyn Manson in an assault case dating back to 2019. The warrant has been issued by the Police department of New Hampshire, United States.
The 52-year-old singer is charged with two counts of misdemeanor simple assault. The alleged incident took place with a female videographer at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion. The assault was not sexual in nature. As per the police statement, Manson was aware of the warrant for quite some time but has yet not responded.
The Gilford Police Department has said that each charge carries a possible jail sentence of less than a year and a fine of up to $2,000.
Manson's attorney Howard King, in a statement to People, has said that the videographer had asked for $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with her arm during the singer’s live concert. When asked for the evidence, the videographer never came back and directly complained to the police.
Calling the entire claim ludicrous, King further said that they are ready to cooperate with the authorities. But an investigation done by People has revealed that Manson deliberately shot his snot at the videographer. Among the people who stood by this claim are three concert attendees, including a security guard.
Manson is no stranger to controversies. A few months ago, he was accused by at least 12 women of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse. Among those who have levelled serious charges against him are actresses Evan Rachel Wood and Esmé Bianco. His ex-girlfriend Ashley Morgan Smithline has also accused him of abuse.

Marilyn Manson: Haftbefehl wegen mutmaßlicher Spuckattacke,"Gegen Schock-Rocker Marilyn Manson liegt ein Haftbefehl vor - wegen einer Spuckattacke.
Neue Negativ-Schlagzeilen um Marilyn Manson (52): Gegen den Skandal-Musiker liegt ein Haftbefehl vor. Die Polizei Gilford im US-Bundestaat New Hampshire bestätigte am Mittwoch (25. Mai) auf ihrer Facebookseite, dass Manson aufgrund mutmaßlicher Körperverletzung eine Haftstrafe drohe. Allerdings seien die Vorwürfe nicht ""sexueller Natur"", stellte die Polizei klar.
Demnach gehe es um einen Vorfall aus dem August 2019. Laut US-Medienberichten soll der Sänger bei einem Konzert eine Filmkamera bespuckt haben. Das zeigen auch Aufnahmen, die dem US-Promiportal ""TMZ"" vorliegen. Manson soll dabei auch die Kamerafrau getroffen haben, die von den Veranstaltern des Konzertes beauftragt worden war. Drei auf dem Konzert anwesende Personen behaupten laut dem US-Magazin ""People"", dass der Sänger die Frau zusätzlich mehrfach gezielt bespuckt habe.
Anwalt bezeichnet Vorwürfe als ""lächerlich""
Mansons Anwalt Howard King bezeichnete die Vorwürfe in einer Mitteilung, die ""People"" vorliegt, als ""lächerlich"". Es sei kein Geheimnis, dass Manson gerne auf der Bühne provoziere, ""besonders vor der Kamera."" Die Kamerafrau hätte nach dem Konzert eine Geldforderung über 35.000 Dollar gestellt, ""nachdem ein kleine Menge Spucke"" den Arm getroffen habe. Beweise für mögliche Schäden habe man bis heute nicht erhalten.
Seit Anfang des Jahres erheben mehrere Frauen schwere Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen den Schock-Rocker. Den Stein ins Rollen gebracht hatte im Februar dieses Jahres ""Westworld""-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (33), die mehrere Jahre mit Manson liiert gewesen war. Wood hatte auf Instagram erklärt, dass Manson sie ""jahrelang schrecklich missbraucht"" habe. Sie sei ""einer Gehirnwäsche unterzogen und durch Manipulation zur Unterwerfung gebracht"" worden.
Manson weist alle Vorwürfe von sich. In einem Statement teilte er mit: ""Offensichtlich waren mein Leben und meine Kunst lange Zeit Magneten für Kontroversen, aber diese jüngsten Behauptungen über mich sind schreckliche Verzerrungen der Realität."" Sein Musiklabel und sein Manager hatten später die Zusammenarbeit mit Manson beendet.",2021-05-26T07:55:00Z,https://www.stern.de,STERN.de
Marilyn Manson: Haftbefehl gegen den Schock-Rocker!,"Achtung, jetzt wird‘s eklig!
Es ist ja nicht so, dass Schock-Rocker Marilyn Manson derzeit nicht schon genug Ärger hätte: Insgesamt 15 Frauen, darunter US-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood (33) und GoT-Star Esmé Bianco (38), haben schwere Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen den Musiker erhoben. Und jetzt kommt noch dieser Aufreger dazu:
Gegen Marilyn Manson wurde Haftbefehl erlassen. Der Vorwurf: Körperverletzung.

Bei dem vermeintlichen Angriff soll Manson jedoch nicht handgreiflich im klassischen Sinne geworden sein. Stattdessen habe er bei einem Konzert die Kamera einer Mitarbeiterin angespuckt.
Der Vorfall ereignete sich laut Behörden bereits im Jahr 2019 bei einem Auftritt in der Stadt Gilford im US-Staat New Hampshire. Dort wurde auch der Haftbefehl ausgestellt. Dies teilte die örtliche Polizei am Dienstagabend auf ihrer Facebookseite mit. Marilyn Manson sei bis jetzt nicht nach New Hampshire zurückgekehrt, um sich zu stellen.

Laut der Polizeibehörde wissen der Skandal-Sänger und seine Anwälte schon seit geraumer Zeit von den Vorwürfen, doch habe man sich nie um Klärung bemüht. Mansons Anwälte wiesen den Vorwurf laut des US-Magazins TMZ zurück: Sie stünden seit Bekanntwerden des Vorfalls im Oktober 2019 in Kontakt mit der Polizeibehörde.

Schockrock-Ikone Marilyn Manson kommt aus den Skandalen nicht heraus: Jetzt wird der Musiker im US-Bundesstaat New Hampshire per Haftbefehl gesucht. Dabei geht es allerdings nicht um weitere Vorwürfe sexuellen Missbrauchs, sondern um eine Schnodder-Attacke.
Der Vorfall ereignete sich auf einem Konzert im Jahr 2019: Eine Kamerafrau, die angeheuert war, um dieses zu filmen, wirft Marilyn Manson vor, sie bespuckt und mit Schnodder bespritzt zu haben. Dabei sei nicht nur ihre Würde, sondern auch ihre teure Ausrüstung beschädigt worden.
Marilyn Mansons Anwalt Howard King sieht die Sache allerdings anders: Wie er gegenüber People.com mitteilte, hatte die Klägerin zunächst eine Summe von 35.000 US-Dollar gefordert - für beschädigte Ausrüstung. Nachdem sie die Schäden nicht nachwies, ignorierte das Team des Musikers die Forderungen. Nun ist es zur Anzeige gekommen.
Auf die Vorwürfe, die Körperverletzung beinhalten, stehen laut lokalem Recht maximal eine Freiheitsstrafe von einem Jahr und eine Geldstrafe von 2000 Dollar. Tatsächlich gibt es Zeugen, die sich zu dem Vorfall gemeldet haben. Die berichten, Marilyn Manson habe mit Freude immer wieder auf die Kamerafrau gespuckt und geschnoddert, nachdem diese auf einen ersten Spuck-Treffer geekelt reagiert hatte. Am Ende sei sie wütend gegangen, während Manson auf der Bühne lachte.

6.51 Uhr: Stiftung Warentest: Trockenfutter für ältere Hunde oft ungeeignet
Trockenfutter versorgt Hunde im Seniorenalter häufig nicht mit ausreichend Nährstoffen. Zu diesem Ergebnis kommt die Stiftung Warentest, die für die Juni-Ausgabe ihrer Zeitschrift ""test"" insgesamt 28 Trockenfutter für ausgewachsene Hunde testete. Viele Seniorenfutter enttäuschten in dem Test, weil sie nicht genügend Aminosäuren lieferten, die ältere Hunde für das Nerven- und Immunsystem brauchen und nicht selber bilden können. Auch Mineralstoffe kamen demnach zu kurz.
Bei 20 von den 28 begutachteten Futtersorten handelte es sich um Futter für ausgewachsene Tiere vor dem Seniorenalter, von denen zwölf gut abschnitten, fünf sogar sehr gut. Auch günstige Trockenfutter von preiswerten Handelsmarken ab 17 Cent pro Tagesration gehörten zu den ""sehr guten"" Produkten.
6.34 Uhr: Drei Tote bei Schiffskollision vor Japan Sapporo
Bei der Kollision eines japanischen Fischerboots mit einem russischen Schiff sind drei Krabbenfischer ums Leben gekommen. Wie die Behörden bekanntgaben, war das Fischerboot am Mittwochmorgen (Ortszeit) vor der Küste der nordjapanischen Hauptinsel Hokkaido aus zunächst ungeklärter Ursache mit dem russischen 662-Tonnen-Schiff zusammengestoßen und gekentert. Zum Zeitpunkt des Unglücks befanden sich an Bord des Krabbenfischers fünf Mann, auf dem russischen Schiff 23. Die Küstenwache konnte zunächst alle fünf Besatzungsmitglieder des Fischerboots bergen, doch konnte bei drei Männern nur noch der Tod festgestellt werden. Ein weiteres Besatzungsmitglied erlitt leichte Verletzungen, der fünfte Mann blieb unverletzt, wie es hieß.
6.12 Uhr: Polizei: Haftbefehl gegen Marilyn Manson nach Auftritt 2019
Gegen den US-Schockrocker Marilyn Manson (52) liegt nach Angaben der Polizei in Gilford (US-Staat New Hampshire) ein Haftbefehl wegen Vorwürfen von Körperverletzung vor. Dies gehe auf einen Vorfall mit einer Kamerafrau bei einem Konzertauftritt des Rockers im August 2019 in Gilford zurück, teilte die Behörde am Dienstagabend (Ortszeit) auf ihrer Facebookseite mit. Manson sei bis jetzt nicht nach New Hampshire zurückgekehrt, um sich zu stellen. Es drehe sich nicht um Vorwürfe ""sexueller Natur"", teilte die Polizei mit, ohne aber weitere Details zu nennen.

Nach US-Medienberichten soll der Rocker bei dem Konzert eine Filmkamera bespuckt haben. ""TMZ.com"" veröffentlichte ein kurzes Video von einem Spuckvorfall. Drei Konzertgänger beschrieben im Interview mit der Zeitschrift ""People"", dass eine Kamerafrau mehrfach bespuckt worden sei. Mansons Anwalt Howard King bezeichnete die Vorwürfe in einer Mitteilung laut ""People"" und der ""New York Times"" als ""lächerlich"". Es sei bekannt, dass Manson auf der Bühne gerne provoziere, ""besonders vor der Kamera"", sagte King. Sie hätten nach dem Konzert eine Geldforderung von über 35 000 Dollar erhalten, ""nachdem ein kleine Menge Spucke"" den Arm der Person getroffen habe. Sie hätten damals Beweise für mögliche Schäden verlangt, aber keine Antwort erhalten.
6.03 Uhr: Donna Leon fürchtet neuen Touristenandrang in Venedig nach Corona
Krimi-Autorin Donna Leon (78) erinnern Fotos und Videos aus dem wegen Corona leer gefegten Venedig an ihre idyllischen frühen Jahre in der Lagunenstadt. Sie hat aber keinen Zweifel, dass der Touristenandrang auch mit Kreuzfahrtschiffen nach der Pandemie wieder einsetzt. ""Verglichen mit vor der Pandemie wird sich wohl nicht viel ändern"", sagte sie der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Deshalb komme für sie eine Rückkehr nach Venedig auf Dauer nicht in Frage.
Die gebürtige Amerikanerin kam 1968 erstmals nach Venedig und lebte ab den 80er Jahren in die Stadt. Wegen des großen Touristenandrangs zog sie aber später in die Schweiz. Venedig ist auch der Schauplatz ihrer weltweit erfolgreichen Krimi-Serie mit Commissario Brunetti. Der 30. Fall, ""Flüchtiges Begehren"", erscheint an diesem Mittwoch auf Deutsch.
5.37 Uhr: In Brasilien festgenommener Mafia-Boss soll nach Italien ausgeliefert werden
Der in Brasilien festgenommene Mafia-Boss Rocco Morabito soll nach Italien ausgeliefert werden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft in Uruguay, wo der als ""Kokain-König"" bekannte Mafioso 2019 aus einem Gefängnis ausgebrochen war, wolle auf einen Auslieferungsantrag verzichten, um eine direkte Überstellung von Brasilien nach Italien zu ermöglichen, teilte Staatsanwalt Jorge Díaz am Dienstag (Ortszeit) mit. Morabito war am Montag gemeinsam mit einem weiteren mutmaßlichen Verbrecher aus Italien in der Stadt João Pessoa im Nordosten Brasiliens gefasst worden.
5.12 Uhr: Verteidigungsministerin Kramp-Karrenbauer zu Gesprächen in Südkorea
Bei ihrer ersten außereuropäischen Reise seit Pandemiebeginn trifft Bundesverteidigungsministerin Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (CDU) am Mittwoch in Seoul ihren südkoreanischen Kollegen Suh Wook. Bei dem Gespräch (Pressekonferenz gegen 10.30 Uhr Ortszeit/03.30 Uhr MESZ) geht es unter anderem um die Strategie im Indopazifik, die Zusammenarbeit im Bereich der Cyberpolitik sowie die sicherheitspolitische Lage mit Blick auf Nordkorea, wie ein Sprecher des Verteidigungsministeriums sagte.
Im Anschluss besucht die Ministerin die Demarkationslinie zwischen Süd- und Nordkorea und trifft sich mit Vertretern deutscher Institutionen in Seoul. Am Donnerstag reist Kramp-Karrenbauer weiter auf die Insel Guam im Westpazifik - ein Außengebiet der USA. Dort besucht sie den US-Luftwaffenstützpunkt Andersen Air Force Base. Die Reise steht im Zusammenhang mit den im September veröffentlichten Indopazifik-Leitlinien der Bundesregierung für die künftige deutsche Außenpolitik in Asien und der Entsendung einer Bundeswehr-Fregatte in diesem Sommer in die Region.
4.52 Uhr: Bundesverwaltungsgericht verhandelt über Luftqualität in drei Städten
Das Bundesverwaltungsgericht verhandelt am Mittwoch (10.30 Uhr) in Leipzig über die Luftreinhaltepläne in drei Städten. Geklagt haben ursprünglich die Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) und der Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland (BUND) zu den Orten Hamburg, Kiel und Ludwigsburg. Von den Vorinstanzen waren die jeweiligen Bundesländer dazu verurteilt worden, die Pläne zu verbessern und teils Diesel-Fahrverbote zu verhängen, um die Belastung mit Stickstoffdioxid zu senken.
Dagegen zogen die Hansestadt Hamburg, die Länder Schleswig-Holstein und Baden-Württemberg und die Städte Kiel und Ludwigsburg vor das Bundesverwaltungsgericht. Stickstoffdioxid entsteht unter anderem im Straßenverkehr und kann der Gesundheit schaden. Darum gelten in Europa Grenzwerte, die nur an wenigen Tagen im Jahr überschritten werden dürfen.
4.28 Uhr: Tierschützer warnen vor Mährobotern: ""Klingen zerschneiden Schnauzen""
Der Deutsche Tierschutzbund warnt vor den Gefahren von Mährobotern für Igel. Die Tiere, die nach dem Winterschlaf auf Nahrungssuche seien, fielen den automatisch laufenden Geräten oft zum Opfer, erläuterte die Organisation in Bonn. Das Problem: Statt zu fliehen, kugeln sich Igel bei Gefahr zusammen - mit fatalen Folgen. ""Die Roboter richten die Igel grausig zu: Die scharfen Klingen zerschneiden Schnauzen oder Füßchen, trennen Stacheln, Hautschichten oder Gliedmaßen sogar komplett ab"", sagte Tierschutzbund-Expertin Katrin Pichl. Ein Großteil der verstümmelten Tiere werde vermutlich gar nicht entdeckt. ""Die Igel schleppen sich ins Dickicht, wo sie an den Folgen der Verletzungen, wie Infektionen oder Fliegenmadenbefall, unbemerkt und qualvoll sterben.""
Der Tierschutzbund rät daher - sofern man wirklich einen Roboter im Garten einsetzen wolle - vor dem Mähen zum gründlichen Absuchen des Grases. Zudem sollten die Geräte den Igeln zuliebe nur unter Aufsicht und um die Mittagszeit auf die Reise geschickt werden - Igel sind nachtaktiv, erst in den Abendstunden tippeln sie los und suchen nach Insekten oder Würmern.
3.45 Uhr: US-Außenminister Blinken: Zwei-Staaten-Lösung einziger Weg zu Frieden in Nahost
Bei seinem Besuch im Nahen Osten hat US-Außenminister Antony Blinken die Zwei-Staaten-Lösung als einzigen Weg zum Frieden zwischen Israel und den Palästinensern bezeichnet. Es gebe die Möglichkeit, die ""Bemühungen zur Umsetzung einer Zwei-Staaten-Lösung wieder aufzunehmen"", sagte Blinken zum Abschluss seiner Reise am Dienstag bei einer Pressekonferenz. Beide Konfliktparteien müssten jedoch bessere Voraussetzungen für eine Annäherung schaffen.
Die USA seien ""noch immer der Ansicht"", dass die Zwei-Staaten-Lösung der einzige Weg sei, ""um die Zukunft Israels als jüdischem und demokratischem Staat wirklich sicherzustellen und natürlich den Palästinensern den Staat zu geben, auf den sie Anspruch haben"", sagte Blinken. Er hob sich damit erneut deutlich von der Nahost-Politik des früheren US-Präsidenten Donald Trump ab, der mit der Haltung früherer US-Regierungen im Konflikt zwischen Israel und den Palästinensern gebrochen hatte.
Zuvor hatte Blinken die Wiedereröffnung des US-Konsulats für Palästinenser in Jerusalem angekündigt. Während Trumps Amtszeit war das Konsulat geschlossen und in die US-Botschaft eingegliedert worden.
2.38 Uhr: Staatsanwalt in New York treibt Ermittlungen gegen Trumps Firma voran
Die New Yorker Staatsanwaltschaft hat ihre Ermittlungen gegen das Immobilienunternehmen von Ex-Präsident Donald Trump einem Medienbericht zufolge entscheidend vorangetrieben. Die ""Washington Post"" berichtete am Dienstagabend (Ortszeit), dass in dem Verfahren eine sogenannte Grand Jury einberufen worden sei. Dabei handelt es sich um ein Gremium von Geschworenen, das in einem nicht öffentlichen Prozedere über eine Anklage entscheiden kann.
Der Staatsanwalt von Manhattan, Cyrus Vance, hatte zuvor auch vor dem Obersten Gericht in Washington die Herausgabe von Trumps Steuerunterlagen erstritten. Er hat bislang keine Anklage erhoben. Bei den umfassenden Ermittlungen geht es unter anderem um den Verdacht, dass Trumps Firma falsche Angaben zum Wert ihrer Immobilien gemacht hat, um Kredite zu bekommen oder sich Preisvorteile zu erschleichen. Vance prüft dem Vernehmen nach auch Schweigegeldzahlungen an Frauen, die angaben, eine Affäre mit Trump gehabt zu haben. Trump weist alle Vorwürfe gegen ihn zurück.
2.12 Uhr: Hochhausbrand bei Offenbach endet glimpflich
In einem Hochhaus in der südhessischen Stadt Rodgau ist am Dienstagabend aus bisher ungeklärter Ursache ein Feuer ausgebrochen. Wie die Polizei mitteilte, wurden in dem als ""Chinesische Mauer"" bekannten Wohnkomplex im Stadtteil Nieder-Roden (Kreis Offenbach) fünf Menschen verletzt, darunter vier Feuerwehrmänner. Die vier Bewohner einer brennenden Wohnung im vierten Stockwerk konnten sich selbst in Sicherheit bringen, ein Nachbar erlitt Verletzungen.

Nach Angaben der Feuerwehr verletzten sich die Einsatzkräfte, nachdem sie die Tür der Brandwohnung geöffnet hatten. Durch die plötzliche Sauerstoffzufuhr sei es zu einer sogenannten Rauchgasdurchzündung gekommen. Die Verletzen wurden mit Verdacht auf eine Rauchgasvergiftung ins Krankenhaus gebracht. Aufgrund der massiven Rauchausbreitung musste das gesamte Hochhaus geräumt werden. Nach Angaben der Polizei sind in dem Gebäude rund 170 Menschen gemeldet. Deswegen seien rund 190 Einsatzkräfte mehrerer Feuerwehren, Rettungsdienste und der Polizei aus dem gesamten Landkreis Offenbach im Einsatz gewesen.
Die meisten Bewohner konnten nach dem Löschen des Feuers und der Kontrolle des Gebäudes wieder in ihre Wohnungen zurückkehren. Mehrere Wohnungen im fünften Obergeschoss seien durch Rauch und Löscharbeiten derzeit jedoch nicht bewohnbar, hieß es. Die Bewohner wurden in Hotels umquartiert.
2.03 Uhr: Trittin: Waffenexporte in die Ukraine widersprechen unserem Grundsatz
Der ehemalige Parteivorsitzende der Grünen, Jürgen Trittin, hat den Vorschlag von Partei-Chef Robert Habeck zurückgewiesen, die Ukraine wegen des andauernden Konflikts mit Russland mit Waffen zu beliefern. ""Waffenexporte in die Ukraine würden unserem Grundsatz widersprechen, dass wir keine Waffen in Kriegsgebiete exportieren"", sagte Trittin dem Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND, Mittwoch).
Habeck hatte sich für Waffenlieferungen an die Ukraine ausgesprochen. ""Waffen zur Verteidigung, zur Selbstverteidigung, kann man meiner Ansicht nach, Defensivwaffen, der Ukraine schwer verwehren"", sagte er während eines Besuchs in der Ukraine dem Deutschlandfunk. Forderungen aus der Ukraine nach Waffenlieferungen seien berechtigt.
Dem widerspricht Außenpolitiker Trittin: ""Die bisherige gemeinsame europäische Position ist, dass der Konflikt in der Ukraine nur politisch zu lösen ist und nicht militärisch. Waffenlieferungen untergraben die Umsetzung des Abkommens von Minsk weiter."" Er befürworte hingegen die die Aufklärungsmöglichkeiten der Organisation für Sicherheit und Zusammenarbeit in Europa (OSZE) zu stärken. Auch könnten Waffen nicht eindeutig als defensiv definiert werden. ""Jede Abwehrwaffe kann auch offensiv genutzt werden.""
1.25 Uhr: Belastende Vorwürfe: Jüngster Abgeordneter Tschechiens tritt zurück
Der jüngste Parlamentsabgeordnete Tschechiens legt sein Mandat nieder, nachdem ihm mehrere Frauen sexuelle Übergriffe vorgeworfen haben. Der 24 Jahre alte Politiker Dominik Feri teilte am Dienstag mit, er werde bei der Wahl Anfang Oktober nicht mehr antreten. Feri wies die Anschuldigungen zurück und kündigte an, sich vor Gericht zu wehren. Er galt als Nachwuchsstar der tschechischen Konservativen, die sich im Wahlbündnis Spolu (Gemeinsam) zusammengeschlossen haben.
Mehrere junge Frauen hatten in einem von den Zeitungen ""Denik N"" und ""Alarm"" veröffentlichten Artikel schwere Vorwürfe gegen Feri erhoben. Sie seien von ihm ohne Zustimmung zum Sex gedrängt worden. Die Polizei gab bekannt, dass sie sich mit den Informationen in dem Bericht befasse. In den nächsten Tagen werde über die Einleitung möglicher Ermittlungen entschieden. Mit seiner Wahl 2017 war Feri zum jüngsten Abgeordneten in der Geschichte Tschechiens geworden.
0.30 Uhr: Biden: Sanktionen gegen Nord Stream 2 wären ""kontraproduktiv"" gewesen
Sanktionen zur Verhinderung der bereits fast fertiggestellten deutsch-russischen Pipeline Nord Stream 2 wären nach Ansicht von US-Präsident Joe Biden ""kontraproduktiv"" für das Verhältnis zu Europa gewesen. Er sei ""von Anfang an"" gegen das Projekt gewesen, aber nun sei die Pipeline fast fertig, sagte Biden am Dienstag (Ortszeit) im Garten des Weißen Hauses anwesenden Journalisten zufolge. Die US-Verbündeten in Europa kennen seine Position in der Sache, wie Biden weiter erklärte.
Die US-Regierung hatte vergangene Woche offiziell auf das Verhängen von Sanktionen gegen die Betreibergesellschaft der Pipeline verzichtet. In einem Bericht des Außenministeriums an den Kongress hieß es, der Verzicht auf Strafmaßnahmen gegen die Nord Stream 2 AG im schweizerischen Zug, deren deutschen Geschäftsführer Matthias Warnig sowie vier weitere Mitarbeiter sei im ""nationalen Interesse"". Die Republikaner in Washington werfen dem Demokraten Biden allerdings vor, Kremlchef Wladimir Putin damit ""ein Geschenk"" gemacht zu haben.",2021-05-26T05:01:00Z,https://www.stern.de,STERN.de
Marilyn Manson tiene una orden de arresto por agredir a una camarógrafa durante un concierto,"Un departamento de New Hampshire reveló que cuentan con una orden de arresto en contra de Marilyn Manson (Foto: EFE/Anthony Anex)
Un departamento de policía dentro de New Hampshire reveló que cuentan con una orden de arresto en contra de Brian Hugh Warner, mejor conocido como Marilyn Manson.
En un comunicado en su cuenta de Facebook, el Departamento de Policía de Gilford anunció que tiene una orden de arresto activa para el hombre de 52 años por dos cargos de delito menor de asalto simple que involucra un presunto incidente con una camarógrafa en el pabellón de Bank of New Hampshire. Según este, todo sucedió en un concierto el 19 de agosto del 2019.
De acuerdo con el oficio, el cantante tiene conocimiento de la orden de arresto desde hace un tiempo, pero no ha hecho ningún esfuerzo para responder.
“El Sr. Warner, su agente y asesor legal están al tanto de la orden desde hace algún tiempo y no ha hecho ningún esfuerzo por regresar a New Hampshire para responder a los cargos pendientes. El camarógrafo había sido subcontratado por una empresa con sede en NH para grabar el concierto y estaba ubicado en el área del foso del escenario cuando ocurrieron los presuntos asaltos”, explicó el departamento.

Por su parte Howard King, abogado de Manson, alegó a la revista People que el reclamo de delito fue hecho después de que la camarógrafa pidió 35,000 dólares por las afectaciones causadas a su equipo de grabación.
“No es ningún secreto para cualquiera que haya asistido a un concierto de Marilyn Manson que le gusta ser provocativo en el escenario, especialmente frente a una cámara. Este reclamo por delito menor se llevó a cabo después de que recibimos una demanda de una camarógrafa del lugar por más de 35,000 dólares después de que una pequeña cantidad de saliva entrara en contacto con su brazo. Después de que solicitamos evidencia de cualquier presunto daño, nunca recibimos una respuesta”, explicó King a la publicación.
El letrado calificó los reclamos como “ridículos”, pero explicó que “seguirán” colaborando con las autoridades.
No obstante, la revista entrevistó a dos asistentes de dicho concierto, así como a un guardia de seguridad, quienes expresaron que vieron al intérprete escupir y lanzar sus mocos contra la mujer, mientras ella estaba trabajando.

“Él estaba escupiendo por todas partes y una vez apareció en su cámara, así que ella se limpió y se veía irritada. Él se dio cuenta de esto y siguió escupiendo a propósito en su cámara. Creo que su última gota es que él se tiró al suelo, se puso a 2 o 3 pies (menos de un metro) de ella y le lanzó un cohete de mocos gigante, no a la cámara. Ella estaba enojada y disgustada, así que se marchó furiosa y él se rió”, contó una asistente a People.
La mujer explicó que después de ese incidente, le dijo a su esposo que no iría de nuevo a ninguno de sus conciertos. Además, agregó que no volvió a escuchar su música. Mientras que un segundo asistente corroboró la historia para la revista.
Además, el guardia de seguridad explicó que él estaba “justo ahí” cuando todo pasó y describió que la camarógrafa estaba enfadada por lo que Manson había hecho.
“Le escupió un par de veces y luego se inclinó muy cerca de la cámara y le lanzó un enorme cohete de mocos. Después de que él hizo eso, ella casi tira su cámara al suelo”, aseveró.

Schockrock-Ikone Marilyn Manson kommt aus den Skandalen nicht heraus: Jetzt wird der Musiker im US-Bundesstaat New Hampshire per Haftbefehl gesucht. Dabei geht es allerdings nicht um weitere Vorwürfe sexuellen Missbrauchs, sondern um eine Schnodder-Attacke.
Der Vorfall ereignete sich auf einem Konzert im Jahr 2019: Eine Kamerafrau, die angeheuert war, um dieses zu filmen, wirft Marilyn Manson vor, sie bespuckt und mit Schnodder bespritzt zu haben. Dabei sei nicht nur ihre Würde, sondern auch ihre teure Ausrüstung beschädigt worden.
Marilyn Mansons Anwalt Howard King sieht die Sache allerdings anders: Wie er gegenüber People.com mitteilte, hatte die Klägerin zunächst eine Summe von 35.000 US-Dollar gefordert - für beschädigte Ausrüstung. Nachdem sie die Schäden nicht nachwies, ignorierte das Team des Musikers die Forderungen. Nun ist es zur Anzeige gekommen.
Auf die Vorwürfe, die Körperverletzung beinhalten, stehen laut lokalem Recht maximal eine Freiheitsstrafe von einem Jahr und eine Geldstrafe von 2000 Dollar. Tatsächlich gibt es Zeugen, die sich zu dem Vorfall gemeldet haben. Die berichten, Marilyn Manson habe mit Freude immer wieder auf die Kamerafrau gespuckt und geschnoddert, nachdem diese auf einen ersten Spuck-Treffer geekelt reagiert hatte. Am Ende sei sie wütend gegangen, während Manson auf der Bühne lachte.

New Hampshire police chief says Marilyn Manson accuser is a woman who was spat on by the shock rocker,"In a series of e-mails with the Globe, Bean Burpee said the charges are based on state law that considers “unprivileged physical contact to another” as a simple assault punishable by a maximum of a $2,000 fine or less than a year in jail.
The Gilford, N.H. police chief who wants to arrest Marilyn Manson said the shock rocker spat on a woman videographer at a 2019 concert and that he publicized the charges because of allegations other women have made against Manson.
Manson, whose legal name is Brian Warner, was charged under that law after the videographer reported what happened to her while she was working at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion on Aug. 18, 2019. The arrest warrants for Manson were issued in October 2019, the chief said.

“The victim did not agree in the course of her employment to allow anyone to have unprivileged contact with her; the job was to video the show,” Bean Burpee wrote. “Is anyone being spit on acceptable if they haven’t previously agreed to such behavior?”
Manson’s attorney, Howard King, said that a “small amount of spit came into contact with their arm” during the concert, and claimed the videographer only turned to police after the performer refused to pay $35,000 in damages without offering proof of what happened.
Bean Burpee confirmed the criminal charge is based on the woman being struck by Manson’s spit.
The police chief noted that several women have claimed in lawsuits and in social media postings that Manson sexually abused or physically assaulted them during their interactions with him over the years. Manson, and his lawyers, have denied the allegations.
“For someone who has been adamantly denying all allegations, he [Manson] has been lax in addressing them through the proper criminal justice system we have in this country,” Bean Burpee wrote. “In light of more recent allegations being made against him, we thought it timely to remind him that he still has a matter in NH to address.”

Bean Burpee said his department has repeatedly tried to get Manson and his legal team to respond to the pending criminal case since the arrest warrant was issued by a bail magistrate in October 2019. The department has not been successful.
That, he said, is one of the reasons he posted about the outstanding charge Tuesday on the department’s Facebook page, triggering national coverage of the incident.
“The victim has been waiting to put this matter in the past, which can’t occur until Mr. Warner answers to the allegations as in all criminal cases,’' Bean Burpee wrote. “We would like to close the warrant by making an arrest so that Mr. Warner can be given a court date and the victim allowed to tell her account to a judge.”
Bean Burpee said the videographer has no connection to anyone on his department. “She is one of many of Mr. Warner’s alleged victims as it would appear many others have come forward regarding his behavior, too,’' he wrote.
In his statement to the Globe on Tuesday, Manson’s attorney said his client is well-known for his “provocative” concert performances.
“It is no secret to anyone who has attended a Marilyn Manson concert that he likes to be provocative on stage, especially in front of a camera,” King wrote in an e-mail Tuesday night. “This misdemeanor claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm. After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply.

“This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout,” King added.
The Globe is seeking King’s response to the comments by the police chief.

Marilyn Manson wanted in New Hampshire for alleged assault in 2019,"The alleged assaults involved a videographer shooting footage of Manson’s performance at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion on Aug. 18, 2019, police said.
Manson, whose real name is Brian Hugh Warner, is wanted on two counts of misdemeanor simple assault, police said.
The musician Marilyn Manson is wanted in New Hampshire on simple assault charges stemming from an alleged incident involving a videographer during a concert in 2019, the Gilford, N.H., Police Department said in a Facebook post Tuesday.
In the Facebook post, police seem to suggest that Manson has been ignoring the arrest warrant.
“Mr. Warner, his agent and legal counsel have been aware of the warrant for some time and no effort has been made by him to return to New Hampshire to answer the pending charges,” police said in the post.

The arrest warrant was issued Oct. 8, 2019, according to WMUR-TV.
Manson’s attorney, Howard King, called the allegations against his client “ludicrous.”
“It is no secret to anyone who has attended a Marilyn Manson concert that he likes to be provocative on stage, especially in front of a camera,” King said in an e-mail Tuesday night. “This misdemeanor claim was pursued after we received a demand from a venue videographer for more than $35,000 after a small amount of spit came into contact with their arm. After we asked for evidence of any alleged damages, we never received a reply.
“This whole claim is ludicrous, but we remain committed to cooperating with authorities, as we have done throughout,” King added.
The videographer was subcontracted by a New Hampshire-based company and had been positioned in the stage pit area when the alleged assaults took place, police said.
Police did not make clear the nature of the assaults but emphasized that Manson is not being charged with sexual assault.

“The alleged assaults are not sexual in nature as has been asked by several other media outlets due to a number of other allegations made against Mr. Warner,” police said in the Facebook post, referencing sexual assault and domestic abuse allegations made against Manson by former romantic partners.
The assault charges are Class A misdemeanor, which carries a possible jail sentence of less than one year and a fine of $2,000 or less, police said.

Gegen den US-Schockrocker Marilyn Manson (52) liegt nach Angaben der Polizei in Gilford (US-Staat New Hampshire) ein Haftbefehl wegen Vorwürfen von Körperverletzung vor. Dies gehe auf einen Vorfall mit einer Kamerafrau bei einem Konzertauftritt des Rockers im August 2019 in Gilford zurück, teilte die Behörde am Dienstagabend (Ortszeit) auf ihrer Facebookseite mit. Manson sei bis jetzt nicht nach New Hampshire zurückgekehrt, um sich zu stellen. Es drehe sich nicht um Vorwürfe «sexueller Natur», teilte die Polizei mit, ohne aber weitere Details zu nennen.
Nach US-Medienberichten soll der Rocker bei dem Konzert eine Filmkamera bespuckt haben. «TMZ.com» veröffentlichte ein kurzes Video von einem Spuckvorfall. Drei Konzertgänger beschrieben im Interview mit der Zeitschrift «People», dass eine Kamerafrau mehrfach bespuckt worden sei.
Mansons Anwalt Howard King bezeichnete die Vorwürfe in einer Mitteilung laut «People» und der «New York Times» als «lächerlich». Es sei bekannt, dass Manson auf der Bühne gerne provoziere, «besonders vor der Kamera», sagte King. Sie hätten nach dem Konzert eine Geldforderung von über 35 000 Dollar erhalten, «nachdem ein kleine Menge Spucke» den Arm der Person getroffen habe. Sie hätten damals Beweise für mögliche Schäden verlangt, aber keine Antwort erhalten.
Im Februar hatten US-Schauspielerin Evan Rachel Wood und mehrere andere Frauen Missbrauchvorwürfe gegen Manson publik gemacht. In einem Instagram-Posting warf Wood ihrem Ex-Freund jahrelangen «grauenhaften» Missbrauch vor. Die Polizei in Los Angeles leitete daraufhin eine Untersuchung zu Vorwürfen häuslicher Gewalt ein. Der Sänger hatte damals die Vorwürfe umgehend zurückgewiesen. Seine Kunst und sein Leben seien schon lange «Magnete für Kontroversen», aber die Behauptungen über ihn seien «schreckliche Verfälschungen der Realität», schrieb der Musiker im Februar auf Instagram.

Marilyn Manson passa a ser procurado pela polícia,"O músico Marilyn Manson agora é um homem procurado pela justiça. De acordo com o TMZ, as autoridades de New Hampshire, nos Estados Unidos, passaram a procurar Manson depois que um mandado de prisão foi expedido por conta de uma ocorrência de 2019, ou seja, nada com relação às acusações de ataques sexuais feitas ainda este ano.
Segundo o Departamento de Polícia de Gilford, New Hampshire, Manson é procurado por ter agredido um cinegrafista que trabalhou com ele durante um show na cidade. O vídeo onde ele aparece cuspindo na lente da câmera do profissional foi divulgado pelo TMZ.
Na gravação, é possível ver que até os espectadores ficaram enojados com a situação. A polícia confirmou que a suposta agressão ocorreu durante o show em agosto de 2019, e também explicou que o cinegrafista foi contratato pela produção do evento.
Fontes familiarizadas com o caso disseram que o cameraman ainda alegou ter sido atingindo por parte da cusparada de Manson, cujo nome verdadeiro é Brian Hugh Warner. Isso teria sido o principal motivo para que a polícia fosse procurada. Se condenado, Warner pode ficar detido por dois anos.
O departamento de polícia disse ao site que a suposta vítima ""não sofreu ferimentos"", mas que Manson foi acusado porque cuspir constitui ""contato físico não privilegiado"".
Policiais afirmam que Manson, seu agente e sua equipe jurídica sabem sobre o mandado há algum tempo e, apesar disso ""nenhum esforço foi feito por ele para retornar a New Hampshire para responder às acusações pendentes"". Procurados, representantes de Manson negam isso, e dizem que estiveram em contato com a polícia desde que o mandado foi emitido.
Vítimas reunidas
Após Evan Rachel Wood tornar público as denúncias de abuso contra Marilyn Manson, outras mulheres também começaram a contar experiências traumáticas que tiveram com o cantor, que envolvem desde abuso psicológico e físico até estupro.
O TMZ divulgou, em fevereiro, que o Departamento de Xerife do Condado de Los Angeles agendou uma reunião com mais uma vítima que abriu denúncia contra Marilyn.
Ao todo, o artista já foi acusado por 11 mulheres, por crimes como violência doméstica, abuso emocional, tortura e estupro.
De acordo com o site, a suposta vítima será ouvida nos próximos dias e o Departamento irá colher depoimentos.
Entre as famosas que denunciaram o cantor, estão Evan Rachel Wood, Phoebe Bridgers e Esmé Bianco, que descreveu cenas de tortura durante a gravação de um clipe que fez com Marilyn.
Em seu instagram pessoal, Manson negou todas as acusações.",2021-05-26T03:00:00Z,https://www.ofuxico.com.br,OFuxico
