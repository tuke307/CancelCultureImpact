"Kanye West's Infamous ""F*ck Adidas"" MBDTF Vinyl Hits Auction Block And The Asking Price Is Out Of This World","Kanye West has made some iconic albums during this time as an artist. Overall, one could make the argument that he has the most classic records out of any artist in hip-hop. Moreover, if you expand outside of the genre, you will be hard-pressed to find any artist with as many classics as him. One of those classics is the 2010 masterpiece My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which many believe to be his best record. Others look to his original trilogy, while some even believe that Yeezus is his best work.
If you remember, back in February, a fan had him sign a vinyl version of MBDTF. As you can see in the video clip below, he wrote ""F*ck Adidas"" on it. The vinyl record is now being placed on the auction block through Moments in Time. Of course, there is a bit of a catch here. According to TMZ, the vinyl will be sold for over $500K. They won't accept any bids below that, which means anyone who wants this piece is going to have to shell out a whole lot of money.

Ohne Kanye West: Bianca Censori trifft ihre besorgten Eltern,"Will Bianca Censori (29) ihren Eltern bei einem Treffen zu dritt die Sorgen nehmen? Wie The Mirror berichtete, wurde sie vor wenigen Tagen zusammen mit ihren Eltern beim Abendessen gesehen. Einer scheint bei dieser Familienzusammenkunft allerdings nicht dabei gewesen zu sein: Von ihrem Ehemann Kanye West (46) fehlte jede Spur. Neben der Nichtanwesenheit des Rappers soll noch eine andere Sache aufgefallen sein: Im Gegensatz zu ihren sonst sehr knappen und extravaganten Outfits sei die 29-Jährige auffallend leger gekleidet gewesen.
In den letzten Wochen äußerten sich Biancas Eltern immer wieder besorgt über den Einfluss, den Kanye vermeintlich auf ihre Tochter ausübe. Es wird vermutet, dass Biancas regelmäßiges, halb nacktes Auftreten auf den Willen des Skandal-Rappers zurückzuführen ist. Über die freizügigen Outfits sollen die aus Italien stammenden Eltern nach einem Besuch in Los Angeles hinweggesehen haben. Dass ihr Schwiegersohn nun kürzlich aber auch noch ein Pornostudio eröffnete, habe das Fass zum Überlaufen gebracht. Gegenüber Daily Mail beschrieb ein Insider die Empörung der beiden: ""Die Tatsache, dass er sie in die Welt der Erwachsenenfilme mit hineinzieht und sie bereits als Werbefläche für sexuelle Unanständigkeit benutzt, ist für sie absolut entsetzlich und sehr beunruhigend.""
Bei der Meinung, die Biancas Mutter und ihr Vater aktuell von dem Yeezy-Gründer haben, scheint es nicht abwegig, dass das Model zum Familienessen lieber mal ohne ihren Mann auftaucht. Um welche Themen es bei dem Treffen ging und ob die Architektin in einem Sechs-Augen-Gespräch die Wogen etwas glätten konnte, ist nicht bekannt. Auf Instagram erweckt Bianca jedoch den Eindruck, dass sie nach wie vor hinter dem ""Gold Digger""-Interpreten steht: In den letzten Stunden teilte sie mehrere Fotos mit und von dem 46-Jährigen in ihrer Social-Media-Story.

Bianca Censori Ditches Kanye West For Australian Solo Trip Amid Parents' Reported Concerns,"Kanye West and Bianca Censori's relationship has been at the center of plenty of headlines in recent months. This is largely due to reported concerns from her friends and family members. Earlier this month, a source told Daily Mail that her family worries she'll get dragged into Ye's ""Yeezy Porn"" venture somehow, though it's to be seen whether or not that's still in the works.
Now, however, it looks like Censori has taken some time for herself for a solo trip to Australia. Over the weekend, she was reportedly spotted enjoying a meal with family members at Mario's Café in Melbourne. She switched up her signature shocking style for the occasion, rocking a cozy Miu Miu sweater in place of some of her more provocative pieces.

Per Daily Mail, she ""blended in with the lunch crowd"" due to her inconspicuous outfit choice, allowing her to enjoy her pasta in peace. It remains unclear exactly what was discussed during the laid-back lunch outing, but rumor has it that her dad's been wanting to chat about her racy looks. We're not permitted to post the images directly on HotNewHipHop. If you'd like to see them, you can do so by clicking the Via link below.
At the time of writing, fans aren't sure what Ye's been up to while she's been gone. They certainly hope, however, that he's finally finishing up Vultures 2 with Ty Dolla Sign. Supporters thought the project would be out by now, but its expected May 3 release date has come and gone. So far, no new music is in sight. Fortunately, Ty claims it could drop ""any day now.""

North West Sings 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King' at 'Lion King' Concert,"North West earned a standing ovation after portraying a young Simba during a live production of The Lion King at the Hollywood Bowl.
On Friday (May 24), the 10-year-old daughter of Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and Kim Kardashian took the stage at the famed Los Angeles venue to sing “I Just Can’t Wait to Be King” in celebration of the animated film’s upcoming 30th anniversary.
The first of the two-night Lion King concert event also featured Broadway star Heather Headley and Grammy-winning Lebo M, along with franchise originals Billy Eichner, Bradley Gibson, Ernie Sabella, Jason Weaver, Jeremy Irons and Nathan Lane, as well as special guest Jennifer Hudson.

The Lion King at the Hollywood Bowl, which is also being held on Saturday (May 25), is being filmed for a Disney+ original special set to debut at a later date.

The audience members cheering on North included her famous parents; siblings Saint, Chicago and Psalm; grandmother Kris Jenner; aunt Kourtney Kardashian and uncle Travis Barker.
The live event featured a full orchestra performing Hans Zimmer’s rousing Oscar-winning musical score led by conductor Sarah Hicks. The show featured the beloved songs written by Sir Elton John and lyricist Sir Tim Rice, including the Oscar-winning “Can You Feel The Love Tonight,” “Circle Of Life” and “Hakuna Matata.”
North made her music debut in 2015 with a cameo in father Kanye’s “Only One” video and then popped up with a verse on her dad’s “Talking/Over Again” from Ye’s collab album with Ty Dolla Sign, Vultures 1. In March, she teased her upcoming debut album, Elementary School Dropout, whose release date has not yet been announced.

La gira faraónica del ‘trapero’ megalómano: por qué los dos conciertos de Travis Scott serán los acontecimientos de este verano en España,"El pasado 13 de mayo la promotora Live Nation anunció que Travis Scott dará un concierto en Madrid. Será el 30 de julio en el Wizink Center. Poco después se añadía una segunda fecha el día 31. Se trata de un acontecimiento único por varios motivos: el principal, que se trata de una de las grandes estrellas internacionales del momento, se podría decir que el heredero natural de artistas como Kanye West y Drake. Pertenece a ese tipo de músicos urbanos muy difíciles de ver por aquí, por lo costoso de sus producciones y no contar con un público tan masivo como en su país. Otro factor que ha otorgado adrenalina extra a todo esto es que los conciertos se anunciasen con poco más de dos meses de antelación, cuando lo ya habitual es que se haga con un año o más de margen (sin ir más lejos, lo que ha sucedido con los dos shows de Billie Eilish para 2025).
El artista (nacido en Houston en 1991 con el nombre de Jacques Bermon Webster II), llega con el denominado Utopia. Circus Maximum Stadium Tour, la faraónica adaptación a los escenarios de lo expuesto en su cuarto y último álbum, Utopia (2023). La gira arrancó en EE UU el pasado mes de octubre y será la primera vez que Scott venga a la Europa continental desde 2018. Las crónicas de su fase norteamericana hablan de un evento histórico, con un público fervoroso y alucinado ante la producción más ambiciosa que ha desarrollado Scott hasta el momento. Una estructura gigantesca de estética post apocalíptica (entre Mad Max y las superproducciones clásicas del cine de romanos) se sitúa en el centro de la arena, con el público alrededor. Sobre el macro escenario, Scott es el único protagonista, solo flanqueado en un discretísimo segundo plano por su DJ de cabecera, Chase B, pero apoyado por efectos pirotécnicos, lumínicos y sonoros que mejor no spoilear.
Hay dos datos bastante indicativos de la megalomanía del proyecto. Uno, que se intentó que uno de los conciertos de la gira se desarrollase en las pirámides de Giza, en Egipto, aunque se tuvo que cancelar por la imposibilidad de llevar esa producción al desierto. Al menos eso era lo que decía el comunicado oficial, aunque hubo otras especulaciones. El otro dato, que en 2023 actuó en el anfiteatro de Pompeya (como Pink Floyd en su célebre concierto de 1972) e invitó al cineasta Harmony Korine a filmarlo. Eso formó parte de uno de los segmentos de Circus Maximus, la película ideada por el propio Scott para acompañar visualmente al lanzamiento de Utopia y que contó con la colaboración de Nicolas Winding Refn, Gaspar Noé y la productora catalana Canada… aunque hay que decir que las críticas fueron muy poco favorables.

No ha sido esta la única incursión delirante de Scott en el mundo del cine. En 2023, estrenó en el festival de Venecia la “comedia de acción experimental” Aggro Dr1ft, de nuevo dirigida por Harmony Korine, filmada enteramente en infrarrojos y coprotoganizada por el cantante junto a… ¡Jordi Mollá! Las críticas fueron aún peores que en el caso de Utopia, pero eso no parece que vaya a parar al multimillonario artista texano en su ambición.
Pero… ¿por qué este tipo es tan importante?
En tiempo récord, Travis Scott se ha convertido en una megaestrella. En 2012 publicó su primera maqueta, Owl Pharaoh y fue tan bien aceptada en su comunidad que en su primera gira invitó al escenario a Kanye West, Chris Brown y Young Thug, entre otros. En 2015 publicó su primer álbum oficial, Rodeo, que llegó al número 3 en su país. Birds In The Trap Sings McKnight (2016) ya debutó directamente en el primer puesto, y lo mismo volvió a suceder con Astroworld (2018) y Utopia, pero también con Jackboys (2019), un disco de colaboraciones apadrinado por él para lanzar a otros artistas del sello que acababa de crear entonces. La tragedia ocurrida en el festival Astroworld de Houston, en 2021, organizado por el propio cantante, cuando una estampida desencadenada al comienzo de su actuación derivó en la muerte de diez jóvenes y dejó aproximadamente 300 heridos, estuvo a punto de acabar con su reputación y su carrera. Pero en 2023 el gran jurado del condado de Harris decidió no presentar cargos penales contra Scott ni contra el promotor de conciertos, después de meses de investigaciones policiales.
“Siento que cada generación tiene una selecta lista de artistas que marcan los caminos a seguir, ya sea estilística, sonora o estéticamente, y Travis es, sin duda, uno de los grandes faros de la última década”, afirma Dano, el MC, productor y artista visual argentino afincado en Madrid, quien valora “su gusto personal a la hora de elegir beats, sonidos, sintes incluso. Él ha marcado y salpicado gran parte de la música contemporánea, no sólo lo considerado urbano”. El fundador del colectivo Ziontifik considera que, además, su influencia ha trascendido al mundo anglosajón y que, por ejemplo, fue fundamental para los pioneros del trap en Argentina. “El uso del autotune en nivel maestro se lo debemos en gran parte a él”, añade. “La idea de utilizarlo como un instrumento y hacer algo musicalmente bonito con tu voz, no únicamente por la estética y el significado. No es un invento suyo, pero sí una aportación. Y los cambios o finales de canción a lo Mike Dean, repletos de sintes analógicos y leads espaciales, aunque es algo que desarrolló Kanye antes, llevan la firma de Travis, al menos en esta década”.

Marta España, musicóloga, periodista especializada en la revistas Rockdelux y NUEBO y artista de pop inclasificable bajo el nombre de Marta Movidas, opina que “el trap existía antes que Travis Scott, pero él ha conseguido convertirse en uno de los máximos exponente del género. Rodeo fue uno de los primeros discos dentro del mainstream en tener un concepto detrás, una narrativa y una historia con unos determinados personajes”, expone. “Ahora mismo, los artistas que están en la cresta de la ola entienden los álbumes como entes conceptuales: hacer una recopilación de temas aislados no sirve, tienes que inventarte una estética o un discurso que acompañe las canciones. The Eras Tour, de Taylor Swift, es el ejemplo más claro, pero Rosalía, Dua Lipa, Rauw Alejandro, Bad Bunny... los artistas más top de América y Europa participan de eso. Desde Rodeo han pasado 10 años: lo conceptual es tendencia ahora, pero Travis lo tenía en la cabeza hace una década”.
Añade la musicóloga que el artista “fue el primero en entender que el trap, pese a lo controvertido de su nacimiento, podía incluirse dentro de la industria capitalista global con los retoques necesarios. Astroworld me parece el ejemplo más representativo de eso. Un disco de hip-hop con colaboraciones de The Weeknd, Frank Ocean, Tame Impala o Stevie Wonder. Por supuesto, fue un hito en su momento en tanto que fusionaba géneros que el público consideraba opuestos e, incluso, enemigos. En aquellos momentos, Tame Impala era el rey del indie, ¿por qué se juntaba con alguien que solo hablaba de putas y drogas? A nivel mainstream es un claro ejemplo del puente cultural que se empezó a tejer durante esos años entre la cultura urbana y la más popera: 2017 fue, al menos en España, uno de los años donde la audiencia se liberó de más prejuicios. Sin embargo, no deja de ser una fórmula para que un género marginal subvierta las condiciones de una industria turbocapitalista hasta llegar a ser el número uno″, apunta.

Álvaro de Villota es director de márketing y desarrollo de negocio especializado en música urbana, pero trabajó durante 16 años en la discográfica de Scott, Sony Music, desde donde siguió de cerca toda su trayectoria. Según él, además de las innovaciones artísticas del músico, su carácter inquieto lo lleva al negocio. “Es un artista cien por cien implicado y en control total de su obra, también lidera e impulsa estrategias de marketing novedosas para visibilizar adecuadamente su propuesta, y tiene muy claro quién es su público”, asegura.
Benicássim (la precuela)
En realidad, esta no será la primera vez que Travis Scott actúe en España. Hace seis años, en el verano de 2018, pasó por el Festival Internacional de Benicássim. “Se le contrató porque tenía mucho sentido en ese momento. El FIB ha sido siempre un festival con mucha presencia del público inglés y, en ese momento, el trap era un género que despuntaba en todos los territorios. Travis Scott tenía, y seguramente sigue teniendo, el show de trap más potente que hay en el panorama y era un artista clave para ser cabeza de cartel el primer día de festival”, recuerda Miqui Ros, uno de los responsables de su contratación en el festival levantino.
“El FIB apostó valientemente en 2018 por traerle en un momento en el que él estaba realmente reventándolo en EE UU”, afirma Álvaro de Villota, aunque también apunta que “fue algo descafeinado. Siento que quizás Europa no estaba aún demasiado en la onda del trap de Travis y no lo recuerdo como un show que me volase la cabeza, nada que ver con la vez que lo vi en EE UU presentando Astroworld”. “El concierto fue un poco más tedioso de lo que pensábamos porque el artista llegó tarde, algo muy común en el género”, justifica Ros. “Travis Scott volaba directamente en jet privado desde su casa hasta Benicàssim, y aterrizó en el aeropuerto de Castellón ya pasada la hora de inicio de su concierto. Subió directamente al escenario sin calentar y sin tocar el camerino. Dio un concierto de 45 minutos, pero con una energía que no dejó a nadie sediento de más, yo personalmente nunca vi a alguien hacer su concierto de una manera tan fácil y consiguiendo que la gente estuviera desquiciada, haciendo varios pogos en cada canción que tocaba. Al terminar el concierto, se subió en su coche y volvió a coger su avión, como si nada hubiese pasado”.

Todo indica que, pese a las dos fechas en Madrid, el español es todavía un mercado virgen para Scott. “Aquí sus cifras son poco relevantes si miramos las métricas que mandan, como el consumo en streaming, seguimiento en redes sociales, nivel de conocimiento a nivel de mercado general, y tampoco le habrás escuchado en ninguna radiofórmula de las importantes”, reconoce De Villota. Sin embargo, sostiene que “gracias a contenidos como su documental disponible en Netflix Look Mom I Can Fly, ese conocimiento también ha ido creciendo en segmentos más amplios de público. Acciones vinculadas al gaming como su activación para el lanzamiento de AstroWorld en Fortnite o similares le han acercado a la Generación Z y al mundo gamer. Parte del misterio para el público europeo también reside en lo poco accesible que ha sido y es para nosotros. Estos shows en Madrid supongo que representan una oportunidad mediática para impulsar su visibilidad en España, aunque si se quedan en un hecho aislado y no tienen continuidad tampoco creo que ayuden a agrandar en exceso su figura. Este tipo de artistas tampoco parecen dispuestos a trabajar los mercados al nivel que exige hoy en día la industria para lograr entrar en otros territorios, porque ya son multimillonarios y tampoco lo necesitan”, concluye el ejecutivo.

Todo esto apunta, pues, a que estamos ante una oportunidad única de asistir a la gira más espectacular de Travis Scott, porque podría no volver. Aunque Marta España aporta otro elemento que nunca podemos olvidar: ¿quién se lo puede permitir? “Lo primero que miré al anunciarse el concierto fue lo que cuestan las entradas (de 86 a 143 euros si excluimos las diversas modalidades de entradas VIP). En perspectiva, no es un precio tan excesivo como las de artistas con unas cifras similares que también han anunciado parada por nuestro país. Sin embargo, considero que su concierto supone un debate más representativo en torno a la accesibilidad a la cultura de las clases más bajas, en tanto que el rap y el trap son el capital cultural de la marginalidad. Quizás, con la entrada al mainstream del género, la audiencia ha variado y los valores sociales que lo rodean se han pervertido un poco. Sin embargo, considero que el porcentaje de fans asiduos que no puedan permitirse el precio de la entrada puede ser, en este caso, mayor que en otras giras internacionales”, apunta la periodista.

La razón por la que Julia Fox lleva dos años sin tener sexo,"Julia Fox sorprendió al confesar que había optado por la abstinencia hace más de dos años. (Créditos: REUTERS/Alisha Jucevic)
Hace unas semanas, Julia Fox sorprendió revelando un dato íntimo al mundo: llevaba dos años sin tener relaciones sexuales. Tras su pasado como modelo y dominatrix, la expareja de Kanye West dejó varias interrogantes en sus seguidores tras ese cambio en su vida. La explicación la brindó en una entrevista para el programa “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen”, show en el que dijo ser célibe por razones políticas.
Una forma de protesta
La actriz conocida por su papel en Uncut Gems anunció su celibato al escribir un comentario en un video de TikTok que criticaba un campaña publicitaria de la aplicación de citas Bumble. La campaña incluía el eslogan: “Un voto de celibato no es la respuesta”. En respuesta, Fox comentó: “2.5 años de celibato y nunca me he sentido mejor”.
Algunos días después, al sentarse en el programa de Andy Cohen, la modelo dedicó unos minutos a explicar que su abstinencia era una forma personal de protesta. Su decisión de evitar el sexo fue en respuesta a la derogación reciente de una histórica sentencia que despenalizó el aborto.
Fox explicó que evita el sexo como una forma de protesta personal contra la revocación de Roe vs. Wade. (Créditos: REX Features/Shutterstock /The Grosby Group)
“Creo que con la revocación de Roe vs. Wade y nuestros derechos siendo despojados, esta es una manera en que puedo recuperar el control”, dijo la actriz, mientras era aplaudida por el público presente.
Lo que inicialmente comenzó como un periodo de seis meses de abstinencia sexual se extendió indefinidamente. Fox confesó que no tiene una fecha límite para ello: “Fue inicialmente seis meses, luego un año, y ahora digo ‘Oh Dios mío, ya van casi dos años y medio y sigue igual’.
La actriz admitió que al principio extrañaba el sexo, pero ha logrado redirigir esos impulsos hacia otros aspectos de su vida. “Es como dejar cualquier hábito, eventualmente lo olvidas y toda esa energía que ponías en el sexo la puedes poner en otras cosas”, afirmó Fox.

En la entrevista también se habló del autoerotismo y Julia le dijo a los conductores que rara vez se masturba. “No tanto como ustedes pensarían. Tal vez una o dos veces al mes”, admitió y lo atribuyó a su inconsistente nivel de energía: “A veces comienzo, pero luego me canso y pierdo el interés. No sé si alguien puede identificarse, pero estoy cansada todo el tiempo”.
Además de su faceta como actriz, Fox ha tenido una vida personal mediática, especialmente tras su breve pero comentada relación con el rapero Kanye West en 2022, poco después de su separación de Kim Kardashian. Sorprendentemente, Fox mencionó en una entrevista que no documentó su vida sexual con West en su libro “Down the Drain” porque “simplemente fue inexistente”.
En su momento, la celebridad explicó que su relación con el rapero no prosperó porque acababa de convertirse en madre y no estaba dispuesta a asumir la responsabilidad de “tener dos bebés”.

Son “relaciones vergonzosas”, dijo a Cosmopolitan sobre sus romances pasados. Respecto al rapero, Julia afirmó que este llamaba a los paparazzis para que los fotografíen, intentó conseguirle una cirugía estética para los senos y también criticaba a sus amistades.
En su autobiografía de 2023, “Down the Drain”, Julia Fox amplió más sobre su esfera sentimental y su pasado como dominatrix. Hoy en día, su vida es más serena.

Who do Kim Kardashian's kids really look like?,"There's no denying North is the spitting image of her father. She has the same cheeky smile and facial structure as her dad, though it looks like she's also inherited her mum's brown doe eyes.
Though Kanye keeps his hair buzzed, North clearly got his dad's genes there too, with tight black curls she usually wears in traditionally Black styles.
Fans are hyper-aware of the resemblance too, though some have claimed North also resembles aunt Kourtney Kardashian - to which Kim replied on Twitter: ""Now this I agree with so much!!!""
Saint West
Kim's eldest son looks like another Kanye mini-me at first glace, but he also inherited plenty of his mum's features. Just ask her.
When a fan tweeted Kim in 2021 saying that Saint looks ""just like a light skin Kanye"" the reality star replied, ""Really? People say this all the time! Why do I think he’s my twin????""
Though Kim says Saint is her ""twin"", he does appear to take more after his dad Kanye - but we'll admit he got his mum's eyes.
Chicago West
Any time Kim shares photos with Chicago to Instagram, fans race to the comments section to gush over how much the little girl resembles her famous mum.
From her lips, to her eyes and facial structure, Chi really is Kim's tiny twin, but the mum of four admitted on Twitter that she's blind to it.
""What’s crazy is I don’t really see that but everyone says it!"" she penned. But when celebrating Chicago's fifth birthday, it seems like Kim can finally see the comparisons, dedicating the tribute to her ""twin.""
But Chi did get something from her dad - specifically, her adorable nose and afro-textured hair.
Do you see the resembalance? Instagram
Psalm West
Kim and Kanye's youngest is almost a perfect mix of both parents, with Kanye's facial structure and several of Kim's famous features.
Fans say he looks like the spitting image of older brother Saint, but a small group of Kim's followers think Psalm looks more like one of his cousins.
Comments always seem to pop up on photos of Psalm likening him to Kourtney Kardashian's eldest son Mason.
One fan even said: ""I feel like his Armenian side is a lot stronger than his siblings. He’s gorgeous.”

Video aufgetaucht: Hier schoss Kanye West gegen P. Diddy!,"Gegen P. Diddy (54) alias Sean ""Diddy"" Combs stehen schwere Vorwürfe im Raum. Nun ist ein inzwischen gelöschter Clip vom ""Drink Champs""-Podcast aus dem Jahr 2022 wieder aufgetaucht, in dem Kanye West (46) sich über den Rapper lustig macht. Darin deutet der Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian (43) an, dass dieser Deals mit den Strafverfolgungsbehörden abgeschlossen habe, die es ihm ermöglichen würden, nicht ins Gefängnis zu müssen.
In dem Video nimmt der 46-Jährige kein Blatt vor den Mund und schießt heftig gegen Diddy. ""Der Grund, warum du reden musst, ist, dass du einen Deal gemacht hast, du scheiß Bundesbehörde"", wütet Kanye und legt im gleichen Atemzug noch einen drauf: ""Das ist der Grund, warum du auf mich losgehen musst, denn Teil des Deals, der es dir ermöglicht, all das zu tun und aus dem Gefängnis zu kommen, ist, dass du versprochen hast, meine Karte zu ziehen."" Dabei nennt er ihn auch bei seinem früheren Spitznamen ""Puff Daddy"".
Die Negativschlagzeilen über Diddy scheinen aktuell nicht abreißen zu wollen. Immer wieder wird ihm Menschenhandel und sexueller Missbrauch in mehreren Fällen vorgeworfen. Aufnahmen einer Überwachungskamera aus dem Jahr 2016 könnten zu einem entscheidenden Beweismittel werden: Darin soll zu sehen sein, wie der 54-Jährige seine damalige Freundin Cassie Ventura (37) auf brutale Weise in einem Hotelflur verprügelt.

Yeezy-Pornostudio: So verärgert Kanye West die Eltern seiner Ehefrau,"Kanye Wests neues Studio sorgt für Ärger bei der Familie seiner Ehefrau.
Von Clara Weinert
Los Angeles - Kanye West (46) hat offiziell sein erstes Porno-Studio eröffnet. Die Eltern seiner Frau Bianca Censori (29) sind davon alles andere als begeistert.
Bianca Censori (29, l.) hatte vor der Ehe mit Kanye West (46, r.) bei dessen Modelabel Yeezy gearbeitet. © Marco BERTORELLO/AFP Seit Dezember 2022 sind der Rapper und die Architektin verheiratet. Ihre Eltern waren zwar noch nie große Fans von dem 46-Jährigen, mit seinem neuen Projekt hat er sich aber wohl endgültig ins Aus geschossen. In einem Interview mit der Daily Mail äußerte sich ein Insider über die Position der Familie: ""Sie haben Angst, dass Bianca benutzt wird, um sexuelle Unanständigkeiten des kontroversen Sängers zu bewerben."" Die Familie sei bereit gewesen, über die antisemitischen Kommentare und das unangebrachte Verhalten des Yeezy-Designers hinwegzusehen, aber das Pornostudio bringe das Fass zum Überlaufen.
Das schmutzige Projekt gehe gegen die Prinzipien der Censori Familie
Seit ihrer Hochzeit mit Kanye West (46) trägt Bianca Censori (29) immer freizügigere Kleidung. © Screenshot/Instagram/the.real.bianca.censori Gründe für den Verdruss auf der elterlichen Seite seien wohl, dass es schwer sei, mit zwei feministischen Schwestern und einer feministischen Mutter Biancas Rolle in dem Studio für Erwachsenen-Filmchen zu verstehen. Es bereite ihnen große Sorgen, dass ihre Tochter von ""Ye"" als Werbung benutzt wird. Zumal er sie wahrscheinlich davon überzeugt haben solle, dass das Studio sie reicher machen würde.

Als Statussymbol? Kanye West schenkte seiner Bianca Porsche!,"Kanye West (46) und Bianca Censori (29) sorgen gerne für Schlagzeilen! Seit 2022 sind die beiden verheiratet – und nun gab es ein luxuriöses Geschenk für die Designerin: einen silbernen Porsche. Eine Psychologin analysierte gegenüber The Sun jedoch, dass Kanyes Geschenk kein Zeichen der Liebe war, sondern eher ein Machtzug. ""Es ging um Befriedigung und diente als mächtiges Statussymbol für Kanye. Er hatte sich wahrscheinlich für Silber entschieden, um sicherzustellen, dass Bianca ohne ihn nicht zu sehr auffällt"", erklärte Jo Hemming. Kanye soll diese Geste genutzt haben, um den Eindruck zu erwecken, seiner Bianca ein tolles Geschenk zu machen.
Die Freude mit dem heißen Schlitten hielt nicht lange. Vor wenigen Tagen wurde der Porsche vor dem Yeezy-Quartier abgeschleppt. Laut der Expertin habe der Rapper damit sein Machtspiel gewonnen – er erlangte den Einfluss auf seine Frau wieder, weil sie nun erneut bei ihm mitfahren muss. Auch das Fahrzeug soll er genau für sie ausgesucht haben. ""Kanye hat wahrscheinlich das Auto und die Farbe für sie ausgesucht, so wie er auch die Kleidung seiner Frau auswählt. Porsche sind sehr angesehene Autos – sie sind hochwertig und schnell."", erläuterte die Expertin weiter.
Kanye soll auch einen großen Einfluss auf die auffälligen Looks seiner Bianca haben. Die Körpersprache-Expertin Judi James geht davon aus, dass der Sänger seine Ex-Frau Kim Kardashian (43) mit seiner neuen Flamme provozieren möchte, wie sie gegenüber Mirror erklärte. Für Bianca seien ihre freizügigen Outfits eine Mutprobe. Doch damit könnte sie auch rechtliche Folgen bekommen: Bei einem Shoppingausflug in Paris vor wenigen Monaten lief sie in einem Hauch von Nichts durch die Gegend – hierfür könnte eine Strafe von 15.000 Euro wegen Exhibitionismus in der französischen Provinz möglich sein.

"Bianca Censori’s Family Worries Kanye West Will Drag Her Into Yeezy Porn, Sources Claim","Kanye West's relationship with his wife Bianca Censori is controversial, to say the least. Ever since he made things official with the Australian model and designer last year, the pair has been subject to a great deal of criticism. Social media users have continuously picked apart everything from Censori's eye-catching outfits to her soft-spoken demeanor. Of course, many theorize that Ye must be behind them.
It appears as though strangers aren't the only ones worried for Censori amid her romance with the Chicago MC, however. Reportedly, some of her family members have also expressed concern, namely due to her revealing looks. In March, a source even told Daily Mail that Censori's father wanted to have a conversation with Ye about her flashy fashion statements, though it's unclear whether or not that ever actually took place. Now, following the announcement of the rapper's ""Yeezy Porn"" venture, sources tell the outlet that they're worried she'll be dragged into the adult film scene.

“The fact that he is dragging her into the adult film world with him and using her as a billboard already to promote sexual indecency is absolutely appalling,” the source reportedly explained. “They feel he has convinced her that this is a good idea because it will make them wealthier.” They continued, citing Ye's porn-addicted past. “Her family and friends are aware of Kanye’s history with pornography, which makes it even more concerning,” they said.

Wird Bianca Censori bald die Scheidung von Kanye einreichen?,"Wer hätte es gedacht? Angeblich soll die Ehe von Kanye West (46) und Bianca Censori (29) bald vorbei sein. Zumindest berichtete das ein Insider nun gegenüber In Touch. Wie die Quelle erzählt, gehe Bianca davon aus, dass Kanye sie zu einem Pornostar machen will! Der Skandalsänger hat Ende April auf seinen Social-Media-Accounts verkündet, er hätte sein eigenes Pornofilmstudio gegründet und auch schon Businesspartner gefunden. Das soll seine Ehefrau allerdings etwas verängstigen. ""Er stolziert mit ihr herum und zieht sie an, als wäre sie ein Pornostar! Jetzt weiß sie auch, warum. Bianca hatte sich darauf eingelassen, weil sie gehofft hatte, er würde sie zum Star machen. Aber das ist für sie wirklich zu viel"", erklärt der Insider.
Schon einmal wurde eine Frau in Kanyes Leben wegen eines pornografischen Videos praktisch über Nacht berühmt: Seine Ex-Frau Kim Kardashian (43) konnte durch ein veröffentlichtes Sextape ihre erfolgreiche Karriere starten. Laut dem Insider ist genau das auch der Antrieb hinter Kanyes Filmstudio. Angeblich wolle er den Erfolg seiner Ex überschatten, indem er einen Blockbuster-Porno mit Bianca in der Hauptrolle dreht. Bianca will davon offenbar nichts wissen: ""Sie hat durch ihn bereits ihre gewünschte Bekanntheit erlangt. Ihre Freunde meinen, sie ist bereit, zu gehen.""
Die Beziehung von Bianca und Ye ist schon seit längerem ein ständiges Auf und Ab. Bereits Anfang des Monats wurden Gerüchte einer Scheidung in die Welt gesetzt, als die Villa des Künstlers ausgeräumt wurde. Wie Mirror damals berichtet hatte, haben Umzugshelfer Möbel, Kartons und Kisten aus dem Gebäude getragen. Allerdings seien weder Kanye noch Bianca zu diesem Zeitpunkt anwesend gewesen.

- Drar henne inn i porno,"I april kom nyheten om at Kanye West (46) hadde planer om å utvide Yeezy-selskapet. Han har allerede hatt suksess med både sko og klær, og ifølge TMZ skulle det neste steget være pornografi. Yeezy Porn, som det skulle hete, har ennå ikke sett dagens lys.
Men det har angivelig ikke hindret de rundt ham å bekymre seg. De siste årene har West og kona Bianca Censori (29) skapt overskrifter verden over - ofte på grunn av sistnevntes svært avslørende antrekk.

Nå skal familien hennes være redd for at West skal bruke kona til å promotere pornografisk innhold, skriver Daily Mail. De skal være redde for at artisten skal «dra henne inn i porno», og mener at han allerede bruker henne som en «plakat for uanstendighet».
- Sjokkerende
En kilde nær både Bianca Censori og hennes familie uttaler at familien har forsøkt å akseptere West for den han er, og at de har gjort det de kan for å se bort fra noen av hans mest kontroversielle uttalelser.

Yeezy Porn skal imidlertid være den siste dråpen.
- Det at han drar henne inn i pornografien og bruker henne til å promotere seksuell uanstendighet er sjokkerende og svært bekymringsfullt, heter det.
West har tidligere hevdet at Kim Kardashian (43) skilte seg fra ham på grunn av at han var avhengig av pornografi.

Familien til 29-åringen skal nå bekymre seg for at dette kan være ødeleggende for West og Censoris ekteskap.
- Familien hennes og vennene hennes kjenner til Kanyes historie med pornografi, som fører til enda mer bekymring. Hva kommer det til å gjøre med ekteskapet? spør kilden.
Verken Kanye West eller Bianca Censori har kommentert disse uttalelsene - det er heller ikke kjent om Yeezy Porn faktisk skal bli en realitet.

Common Talks About All the Dope Kanye West Beats He Passed Up,"Common has been a legend in the game for more than three decades. But even with all his success in hip-hop and on the big and little screens, there’s always that nagging “what if?” question about the doors you didn’t open as well as the ones you did.
Sitting down on the 7PM in Brooklyn podcast with Carmelo Anthony and Kid Mero this week, the 52-year-old Chicago-bred MC, chopped it up about the NBA playoffs and his favorite ballers — as well as getting seriously trash-talked to by Chicago Bulls legend Michael Jordan — but he also shared some previously unheard stories about working with Ye, including the mountain of Kanye West beats he passed on early in his career.
“It’s at least, 10 Ye beats out there that I passed on,” he said of the tracks he didn’t take from fellow Windy City native West. “Even on one of those albums, he like, ‘Common passed on the beat, I turned it into a jam,'” he added in quoting the chorus from “Everything I Am” from Ye’s 2007 Graduation album.
Trending on Billboard
That wasn’t it, either. Common said he also took a pass on such future Ye tracks as “I Wonder” and “Heard ‘Em Say.”
“It’s crazy because I didn’t take any Ye beats, like in that ’96-’97, when-I-met-him era. But then in 2003, I’m like, ‘Ye, lemme get some beats, like come on!,'” Common said. “I felt like at the time No ID was at such a higher level that I was just like, ‘Ye, these beats ain’t doing it for me yet. You gettin’ there, but you ain’t there yet’… I got more memories of joints I passed on, beats that he made for me, that ended up being, like… a lot of his Late Registration album.”
For example, Common said Ye made the beat for ‘Heard ‘Em Say” just for him, writing the song in front of him in 10 minutes. “I was like, ‘This beat dope.’ He was like, ‘You want it?’ and I was like, ‘Man I gotta…’ because it didn’t feel like it was fitting in my album [Be]… So I was like, ‘Nah, you good.’ He said, ‘Are you sure?’ I was like, ‘Nah I’m good.'” Looking back now, he told the hosts, yes, of course “that beat was dope.”
The pair have worked on plenty of other songs, including 2004’s “The Food” single and 2005’s “The Corner,” as well as Ye appearing alongside Common and John Legend on “They Say” from Common’s 2006 Be album, which was produced by West, how also had a heavy hand in writing the entire LP.
The deep-dive round ball talk also found Common saying that if he had to pick a baller to represent him as a rapper, he’s torn between retired three-time NBA champ Dwayne Wade or power forward-turned-broadcaster and round mound of rebound Charles Barkley. “I say that because D Wade had a lot of success too… but I think sometimes D Wade don’t get all the love [he deserves],” Common said, praising both men for pivoting to other careers after they hung up their jerseys.
For the record, asked how he felt about the recent Drake-Kendrick Lamar lyrical battle, Common said now that the war is over he’s confident calling it a “good heavyweight fight… I respected what each one delivered.”

'An Imminent Danger': Read The Letter Kanye West's Former Head Honcho Shared After Quitting The Company Over Yeezy Porn Drama,"It was just a few weeks ago that reports began to surface that Kanye West was looking to take his company in a new direction, and was attempting to get into the porn industry . Now, it seems as though those reports did, in fact, have some weight to them, as his former head honcho has shared the letter he used to quit over the Yeezy porn drama.
What Did Kanye West’s Former Head Honcho Say About Yeezy Porn When He Quit?
The troubles with Kanye West and his many business ventures seemingly know no bounds. Not only is he still occupied with a number of lawsuits for his Donda Academy , and lost several opportunities due to his anti-Semitic comments in late 2022, but now Yeezy’s chief of staff, Milo Yiannopoulos, has opened up to TMZ about leaving his position with the company, because of West’s work to move into the pornography business. Yiannopoulos, who held his job with the mogul for almost two years, shared his full letter of resignation with the outlet, which begins:
I cannot be complicit in the production or dissemination of pornographic films and literature, for moral and religious reasons, but also because such material and the kind of people invariably involved in its production represent an imminent danger to my life as a recovering addict and an unacceptable risk to my spiritual and physical health as a former homosexual.
When the reports came out about the “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” rapper wanting to begin producing porn, insiders noted that he had, supposedly, been attempting to get into the industry for a while, but he and the leaders at Yeezy had finally entered into talks with those who could aid his endeavors. It was said he wanted to start a full entertainment division, with only part of it being dedicated to a porn studio, which he reportedly would have help in setting up from industry vet Mike Moz.
Yiannopoulos continued in his letter, by making his resignation official:
I tender my resignation. I will deliver an orderly handover by Friday May 31, 2024, or the first pornography shoot, whichever is sooner. If, at some time in the future, the company publicly and permanently abandons any plan to produce, distribute or profit from obscene content, it would be an honor to serve you again.
Yeezy’s former chief of staff certainly made it clear that he’s not only not on board with the idea of working for a company that’s involved with pornography, but that he sees it as dangerous to him personally for many reasons, so it’s pretty hard to fault him for leaving the gig behind. However, it’s also rather obvious that he doesn’t bear West any ill will, in general, for this latest business move. He also clarified to the outlet that he does “wish Ye every success in the future. I have some concerns about his new team, and hope he proceeds with caution.”

While Yiannopoulos didn’t specify whether or not that “new team” includes Moz, he, apparently, wasn’t the only one at Yeezy with issues over how things are going at the company. More than one source has told the outlet that “key players” who were once among the leaders at the business have all quit in the past several weeks, but it hasn’t been confirmed by the company, and no one has said whether or not all or any of the other resignations are because of becoming involved in porn. But, we’ll be certain to keep you posted if any more information is revealed.",2024-05-15T16:21:08Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
"Kanye West, Yeezy chief of staff Milo Yiannopoulos part ways","Yeezy chief of staff Milo Yiannopoulos is no longer employed by Kanye West amid a new direction and apparent mass exodus at the embattled rapper’s company.
The 46-year-old Grammy winner, who now goes by “Ye,” and the former Breitbart editor, 39, have parted ways, the latter confirmed in a statement to TMZ.
“I wish Ye every success in the future. I have some concerns about his new team, and hope he proceeds with caution,” the British far-right commentator told the outlet.
Multiple insiders with direct knowledge told the outlet that several Yeezy leaders have jumped ship in recent weeks. It’s unknown whether all the recent departures are linked to the development of Yeezy Porn, but Yiannopoulos’ is.
He noted in his resignation letter, a copy of which he provided to TMZ, that for both moral and religious reasons, he had zero interest in being associated with adult entertainment.
Such a move risked being “an imminent danger to my life as a recovering addict and an unacceptable risk to my spiritual and physical health as a former homosexual,” he reportedly wrote in the letter.
Last month, a rep for the “Heartless” rapper told TMZ he was consulting with Stormy Daniels’ ex-husband, Michael “Mike Moz” Mosny, to launch a pornography division.
If Ye shelves the pornographic plans, Yiannopoulos noted “it would be an honor to serve you again.”
Ye opened up back in 2019 about his struggles with a “full-on pornography addiction” as well as sex addiction.
At the time, he told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe that the affliction had “affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life.”",2024-05-15T15:10:27Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News
Kanye West Yeezy Chief Of Staff Milo Yiannopoulos Resigns Amid Mass Exodus At The Company,"Kanye West has been criticized for a while now due to the fact that he had Milo Yiannopoulos as his chief of staff over at Yeezy. Overall, this was a problem for people due to Milo's questionable beliefs. He rose to prominence during the lead-up to the first Donald Trump Presidency. He fancied himself as a ""provocateur"" who constantly spewed racist, misogynistic, and downright white nationalist beliefs. Eventually, Milo was shunned from the Conservative movement after some poorly thought-out comments about child abuse on the Joe Rogan Podcast.
It feels like no coincidence that Milo was hired by Ye at the same time that the artist was going through his Nazi phase. However, after two years, Milo is walking away from the company. According to TMZ, Milo sent in a resignation letter as he simply cannot be a part of a company that is getting into the porn business. Milo claims Yeezy Porn has the potential to be ""an imminent danger to my life as a recovering addict and an unacceptable risk to my spiritual and physical health as a former homosexual.""

As TMZ reports, Ye has been cleaning house over at Yeezy, and is bringing in a whole new team. Milo isn't so sure this is a good idea. Although he did say that he would be willing to go back to Yeezy. But only if Ye were to get out of the porn business. Recently, it was suspected that Ye changed his mind on the porn idea. However, it appears as though he is moving forward, as originally planned.

Fans Claim That Kanye West Is More ‘Obsessed’ With Bianca After He Ignores Kim on Mother’s Day,"Kim Kardashian posted many pictures of her Mother's Day presents on her Instagram Stories, including one from Paris Hilton and the flowers, her brother-in-law, Travis Barker, sent her. Fans, however, were quite surprised to see that she received no gesture of gratitude from her former spouse, Kanye West, with whom the reality star shares four kids.
As reported by The Sun, one fan commented on Reddit, ""...none from Kanye,"" in response to a picture of Scott's bouquet. Another user chimed, ""Ah, he's too obsessed with Bianca these days...he's moved on."" In the past, West has never shied away from showering the mother of four, with lavish presents on Mother's Day. His grand gestures included an extravagant floral wall for the trainee lawyer's first Mother's Day celebration, in 2014 and a million-dollar check, and an orchestra in the living room, in subsequent years. Kanye continued to make over-the-top plans for Kardashian even when she was away in São Paulo, Brazil, in 2015.

He filled her hotel room in Brazil with expensive flowers, which the reality star later shared on Instagram. The post was captioned, ""I got to my room in Brazil and my amazing, thoughtful husband had the sweetest note with a thousand roses covering my entire suite for Mother's Day! I'm so sad I'm so far away on this day but happy we celebrated yesterday! I love you baby & North soooo much!!!""

West had more surprises in store than just flowers. Later that night, he planned to regale her. Two hours later, Kardashian described on social media, ""So I get to a restaurant in São Paulo & my husband had a string quartet waiting to play Sam Smith!!!!! Every single waiter who brought food said, ‘This is from Mr. West for the best mother in the world!’ Seriously I have the best husband ever!!!""

However, things have now changed. A source told The Mirror back in 2021, ""Kim has no expectations when it comes to Kanye’s Mother’s Day plans involving her. She’s OK whether he does something for her or not and she will not be upset either way. She’ll be with her kids and her mother and so she’s content either way. They barely speak right now so she’s not expecting much of anything.""

Kardashian filed for divorce in February 2021. In a 2022 Vogue cover, she explained the reason behind their split. She said, ""For so long, I did what made other people happy. And I think in the last two years I decided, I’m going to make myself happy. And that feels good. And even if that created changes and caused my divorce, I think it’s important to be honest with yourself about what makes you happy."" She informed the publication, ""I've chosen myself and I think it’s okay to choose you.""",2024-05-15T11:33:03Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

Following his resignation from West's brand, Milo emphasized concerns regarding his involvement in the creation of pornography.
Yiannopoulos expressed apprehension, citing potential risks to his life as a recovering addict and as a former homosexual.
He pledged an orderly handover by May 31, 2024, or sooner, coinciding with the first pornography shoot, if scheduled.
Yiannopoulos reiterated his willingness to serve West again under the condition that Yeezy abandons any plans related to producing, distributing, or profiting from obscene content.
Formerly associated with West's 2024 presidential campaign, he claimed to have facilitated a meeting between West, former President Donald Trump, and far-right figure Nick Fuentes in November 2022.
TMZ sources revealed a series of recent departures among higher-ups at Yeezy, though it remained unclear if West's purported plans for a pornography studio prompted these exits.",2024-05-14T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Lawsuit Over Kanye West's King Crimson Sample in 'Power' Settles,"Declan Colgan Music Ltd have settled their lawsuit with Universal Music Group (UMG) over a Kanye West track which samples King Crimson’s “21st Century Schizoid Man.”
The mechanical rights to “21st Century Schizoid Man” are owned by Declan Colgan Music Ltd, with the company claiming UMG had been underpaying on streaming royalties earned from “Power.” They filed suit in London’s High Court in March 2022.
West, who was not a party to the suit, used the prog rock band’s signature song in his 2010 track “Power.”
The case was due to go to trial in the U.K. this week but settled out of court. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed although Variety understands Declan Colgan Music Ltd received payment as part of the agreement. Reps for Declan Colgan Music Ltd and UMG both declined to comment.
Popular on Variety
King Crimson first included “21st Century Schizoid Man” on their 1969 debut album “In the Court of the Crimson King.” It quickly became one of their best-known songs.
According to Declan Colgan Music Ltd’s lawsuit, West originally sampled the track without license on “Power,” the video for which has garnered over 140 million views since it was first uploaded to YouTube in 2010. “Power” was also included on West’s album “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.”
After the song and album were released UMG and West’s production company Rock the World signed a deal with Declan Colgan Music Ltd entitling the company to royalties. The deal stipulated Declan Colgan Music Ltd would receive royalties on the same terms as West — and West’s deal with UMG stipulated his royalties for both streaming and physical CDs would be comparable.
In their lawsuit Declan Colgan Music Ltd claimed the royalties they received for streaming were not comparable to those they had received for CD sales.
Declan Colgan Music Ltd were represented by Clintons while UMG were represented by Russells.",2024-05-14T16:35:35Z,https://variety.com,Variety
Kanye West Claims He And Ty Dolla $ign Are Like Drake And 21 Savage,"Kanye West is one of the most mysterious artists in all of music. Occasionally he jumps onto social media and shares all of his thoughts in a much more candid manor. But for the most part fans only get into his head on rare occasions. One of those rare occasions came during a recent Hypebeast interview where he shared his feelings on a variety of subjects. One particular claim that grabbed fan's attention immediately was the rapper claiming that he's currently the happiest he's ever been. But now there's another claim getting plenty of attention online.
In part of the interview, West compares himself and his VULTURES collaborator Ty Dolla $ign to Drake and 21 Savage. ""Man, me and Ty have been doing music for so long. It makes me think of 21 Savage and Drake, who are just such a great combination,"" he says in the interview. It's a surprise revelation following the rapper's involvement in beef between Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and J. Cole. West posted to Instagram back in March claiming to have washed all the rappers involved in the beef during their past collaborations. Check out the full interview West gave with Hypebeast below.

Kanye West Once Claimed That Donald Trump Yelled at Him During a Dinner at Mar-a-Lago,"Kanye West claimed that during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, Donald Trump got angry over the rapper's intentions to run for president in 2024. West claimed that the former President began shouting at him, warning that he would face defeat if he went ahead with a 2024 candidacy, as per Yahoo News.
It's no surprise that Trump opposes West's potential run. West detailed the tumultuous encounter in a two-minute teaser video with a campaign-style vibe, which he shared on Twitter in 2022, just two days after he visited Trump's Florida residence.

""When Trump started basically screaming at me at the table telling me I was going to lose, I mean has that ever worked for anyone in history?"" the rapper said. ""I'm like whoa hold on, hold on, hold on. You're talking to Ye,"" he added in the video.
The video was just one of many that the rapper shared on that particular day. West titled the video a ""Mar-a-Lago debrief,"" using it to recount his version of events during his visit to Trump's Florida estate. According to the rapper, Trump was unsettled by West's request for him to be his running mate in 2024. He said, ""I think that was like, lower on the list of things that caught him off guard.""
In another segment of the video, West claimed that Trump insulted his estranged wife, Kim Kardashian. The video censored the insult uttered by Ye, who stated that Trump told him, ""You can tell her I said that,"" according to The Independent.
However, West was offended by the comment. He said, ""And I was thinking like, that's the mother of my children."" West also touched on his political views briefly in the video. He said, ""Since we know, and all the Christians in America that love Trump know that Trump is a conservative, we're going to demand that you hold all policies directly to the Bible.""
Accompanying West on his Mar-a-Lago visit was white supremacist Nick Fuentes, whom he claimed left a strong impression on the former president. He said, “It was the fact that I walked in with intelligence. So Trump is really impressed with Nick Fuentes.""
Fuentes, known for founding the far-right America First Foundation, has faced accusations of being a white supremacist by the Department of Justice. His presence has stirred controversy, leading to bans from social media platforms like Twitter due to alleged hate speech violations. Fuentes gained notoriety for his history of making antisemitic remarks.
That’s hilarious AF. I almost like Ye for a couple of seconds there. It passed. — jessicaandblake8985 (@butwhy9999) November 25, 2022
Meanwhile, the rapper has been a lightning rod for controversy, particularly after he went on several anti-Semitic rants. Major brands such as Adidas, Balenciaga, and Vogue cut ties with West amid the debacle, bringing his estimated net worth down from $1.5 billion to $400 million. A bombshell report earlier also covered a series of accusations from Yeezy collaborators about troubling behavior from the rapper. This included an allegation from unnamed Yeezy staff that West screened an explicit video of Kardashian during a staff meeting in 2018.",2024-05-14T13:00:34Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Julia Fox Celebrates ‘2.5 Years of Celibacy’ After Kanye West Romance,"Julia Fox is making one thing clear about herself — she doesn’t need a relationship. The 34-year-old model recently celebrated being celibate for more than two years. Although she didn’t mention her most recent ex-boyfriend, Kanye “Ye” West, Julia isn’t afraid to get candid every now and then.
Over the weekend, a fan shared a TikTok video featuring multiple billboards promoting the dating app Bumble. The post included slides of the ads, all of which read, “Celibacy is not the answer.” Across the first slide included a message from the social media user, who wrote, “Imagine pretending to be a dating app for women and launching a million dollar ad campaign blaming women for a very normal reaction to men’s violence.”
In response to the clip, Julia commented, “2.5 years of celibacy and never better tbh [sic].” Several fans complimented the Uncut Gems star for her transparency, as one commented, “Queen behavior.” Another chimed in, “I never knew Julia and I would have so much in common.”
In April, Julia spoke with InStyle about her public image and dating history. Since her most famous short-term relationship was with Ye, 46, she expressed that their romance left a “sour taste in [her] mouth.”
“Dating that man for a month — one month,” she said, referring to the public’s perception of her. “And that’s why I have such a sour taste in my mouth about dating anyone in this sphere. Because I don’t ever want to just be known as someone’s girlfriend. I know I’m so much more than that. And I feel like that happens so much to women in this industry. They’re only as good as their partner or they can make a whole career off being some guy’s partner. But regardless, either way, it becomes their identity.”
Julia went on to explain how she wants to “transcend” the reputation and “break that mold.”
“And I want to just stand on my own two feet and not need a man to back me,” she added. “I did that for years. I’m good. I have established myself, and I want to keep establishing myself. And maybe one day, I’ll even be taken seriously.”
Previously, Julia opened up about her past relationship with Ye in her memoir, Down the Drain, which was released in October 2023. While promoting the book at the time, she clarified in an interview with The New York Times that their romance “wasn’t really about” sex because there “wasn’t any.”",2024-05-13T15:32:00Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
"Julia Fox Reveals Surprising Detail About Past Sex Life With Kanye West, Celebrates Over 2 Years Of Celibacy","It's not often that TikTok comments can break news items, but Julia Fox's candid words under a post about a Bumble ad against celibacy seem to have revealed some curious info. Moreover, she celebrated being celibate for the past two and a half years, which many people congratulated or even expressed shock at considering her previous career as a dominatrix. As such, the model never slept with her former partner Kanye West, which was another salacious detail that a lot of folks were talking about online. Despite the more gossipy elements surrounding this decision, it's still a commendable one to make and a lifestyle choice that shouldn't really be subject to scrutiny or criticism as some have done on the Internet.
Furthermore, there is still a lot of interest in Julia Fox and Kanye West's relationship, one that she recently spoke about leaving a ""sour taste in her mouth"". ""I mean, I think we all know what it is,"" she answered a question about which public opinion dogs her the most during an interview with InStyle. ""Dating that man for a month -– one month. And that's why I have such a sour taste in my mouth about dating anyone in this sphere. Because I don't ever want to just be known as someone's girlfriend. I know I'm so much more than that.

"""Je suis une p*te !"", Julia Fox, ex de Kanye West, crée la surprise avec son clip provocant","Crédit photo : Julia Fox / YouTube
Il fut un temps au Julia Fox n’était qu’une petite sensation arty dans le New York underground avec ses photos narrant le quotidien erratique d’une jeune fille junky avant l’heure. Puis, fin des années 2010, la rencontre avec les frères Safdie lui permet d’obtenir un rôle conséquent dans le thriller speed Uncut Gems, face à un Adam Sandler à contre-emploi. C’est une petite révélation chez les cinéphiles. Finalement, le grand public découvre peu ou prou Julia Fox grâce au rappeur controversé Kanye West. Les deux ayant eu une brève liaison sulfureuse et très médiatisée après Uncut Gems. Puis Julia Fox a percé dans le domaine de la mode. Maintenant, elle s’attaque à la pop avec son tube au refrain trash et au clip provoc’, Down the Drain.
Julia Fox : artiste cash et mère de famille
Dans le single Down the Drain, qui tire son titre de l’autobiographie éponyme de Julia Fox sortie en 2023, la chanteuse en herbe scande un refrain aux allures de manifeste féministe émancipatoire. “Je suis une sal*pe, je suis une fille, je suis une femme, je suis une p*te !” Un refrain catchy, éminemment politique, qui accroche directement l’oreille, sur une instru électro bien lourde rappelant du Crystal Castles.
Ce refrain s’impose comme un mantra de vie, aussi, qui définit l’artiste en tant que telle puisque celle-ci assume son côté hypersexuel à grand coup de costume d’infirmière ou de catcheuse sexy. Dans une version alternative du refrain, elle ajoute qu’elle est également, parmi toutes ces appellations, “une mère”. De fait, son fils, Valentino, apparaît au début et à la fin du clip de Down the Drain. Un moyen radical de montrer qu’on peut être à la fois mère dévouée et femme libre.
Julia Fox ou la super-héroïne moderne
Dans le clip de Down the Drain, on la voit prendre à coeur son rôle de mère mais aussi de femme. Elle dépose son fils à la garderie puis part à la recherche de son meilleur ami, le modèle Richie Shazam, dans une odyssée violente et burlesque qui n’est pas sans rappeler une version décalée du film Kick-Ass. Ou réalisée par le réalisateur lubrique Russ Meyer.
Costumée de la tête au pied, avec une appétence pour le latex, Julia Fox est une sorte de Batgirl gothique. Celle-ci éclate les méchants-pas-beaux de ce qui semble être membres d’une secte sataniste. Puis sauve le pauvre Richie avant de retourner chercher son fils à la sortie de la garderie. Preuve s’il en est que la nouvelle icône de la mode arrive à enchaîner sa vie empreinte d’un lifestyle instagrammable et son rôle de génitrice avec une flexibilité qui rappelle celle des super-héros. Julia Fox is the new cool, indubitablement.
Le parcours underground de Julia Fox
Julia Fox a eu 9 vies comme n’importe quelle féline. Dans son autobiographie, qui revient sur une large partie de sa jeunesse, en Italie, dont elle est originaire, puis à New York, où elle déboule très jeune, elle se livre sans détour sur son parcours underground. Voire carrément erratique. Entre fugues à répétition, addiction aux drogues, passage par la case GaV, écoles buissonnière tous les quatre matins, petits larcins et grosses conneries, écriture de poèmes à la Jim Carroll, une brève période d’escort girl puis de dominatrix dans un donjon sexuel. Jusqu’à cette expérience de photographe amatrice où Julia Fox a mis en images sa vie dissolue mais totalement assumée. En 2016, une de ses expos photos met en lumière son travail qui s’inscrit quelque part entre Larry Clark, Dash Snow ou encore Richard Kern et Ryan McGinley.
Puis arrive la sortie progressive mais définitive d’un certain tunnel, en enchaînant deux rôles au cinéma, un dans le confidentiel PVT Chat, où elle incarne une dominatrice SM, expérience inspirée de sa propre vie, donc, puis dans le fameux hit Uncut Gems des frères Safdie. Aujourd’hui, après une autobio, le lancement de ce premier single, lors d’une teuf organisée par l’hyper-popstar Charli XCX, Julia Fox a désormais une émission de mode sur une chaîne de télévision américaine, OMG Fashun. Elle a aussi quelques nouveaux projets cinématographiques sous le coude. L’artiste est le nouveau symbole d’un empowerment féminin dans une industrie du spectacle américaine opérante une lente mutation. Une chose est sûre : Julia Fox est définitivement dans la place !",2024-05-13T08:41:29Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
"Francky Vincent, les vedettes de la téléréalité, Kanye West… les people croqués par Philippe Besson","Par Philippe Besson
Francky Vincent, inoubliable interprète de « Tu veux mon zizi », est catégorique : inviter Aya Nakamura à chanter lors des JO, « c'est une grosse blague », ajoutant : « Les chanteurs, c'est comme les voitures. Il y a les Ferrari et les Twingo. Aya Nakamura, c'est une Twingo. » Qui à sa place, dans ce cas ? Lui, bien sûr ! Il est (hélas) sérieux : « J'ai une voix de crooner. » Les beaufs, c'est comme les cons, ça ose tout.
« Crise de foi » dans la téléréalité, souligne « Public ». Ainsi, Maeva Ghennam (« Les Marseillais »), « entre deux placements de produits, abreuve ses millions de followers de sourates et a troqué ses prothèses de fesses contre un Coran ». Sa collègue Haneia Maurer, « ancienne tentatrice, est devenue mormone. Résolument tradwife, elle propose des recettes de cuisine pour bien nourrir son mari. Fini, les bikinis. » L'ex de cette dernière, Julien Guirado, pour Pâques, a posé devant une croix avec un air pénétré. Rassurez-vous, ils continuent leur juteux business. Croyants mais pas désintéressés.
Kanye West avait jadis affirmé que « sa famille avait été détruite par la pornographie », à quoi il était « addict », et s'en était détourné « grâce à Dieu ». Aujourd'hui, pas à une contradiction près, il annonce se lancer dans la production de films pour adultes. Visiblement, la religion, ça ne marche pas sur tout le monde.

Here's Why Kanye West and Wife Bianca Censori Didn't Attend the Met Gala This Year,"The recent Met Gala 2024 event saw many hopeful celebrities pass on for other things going on in their lives. In the list of absentees also lies the trending couple: Kanye West and Bianca Censori. The rapper and his wife gave bailed on the gala this year despite their enthusiastic appearance and bizarre outfits during their trip across the globe. West, formerly known for his regular appearances alongside his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, purportedly chose to prioritize completing his move from his Los Angeles property instead of attending the event located over 2,000 miles away, as reported by Daily Mail.

The Yeezy designer's last appearance at the Met Gala was in 2019. However, he hasn't received an invitation to the event since 2022. This change occurred after Met Gala director Anna Wintour expressed reluctance to collaborate with him due to a series of anti-Semitic remarks he made during that time. According to a representative from Vogue Magazine speaking to Page Six, the publication and its editor-in-chief expressed no plans for future collaborations with the rapper. ​Wintour, aged 72, has had a longstanding connection with Ye, having extended his first invitation to the Met Gala in 2009. Just last month, she was photographed modeling sunglasses for West's Yeezy brand.
West first appeared at the Met Gala with Kardashian in 2013, when she was pregnant with their first child, North. She attended as West's plus one. The couple made another appearance in 2014, shortly before their lavish Italian wedding, with Kardashian captivating in a magnificent midnight blue dress. Following his split from Kardashian in November 2022, West swiftly tied the knot with Censori in December of the same year. However, fans have started expressing concerns about their relationship due to West's announcement of his intention to launch a pornography studio.

Kardashian and West's final Met Gala attendance was in 2019, where the reality star dazzled in a gold wet-look ensemble while Kanye opted for a $42 black jacket. The 2022 Met Gala was canceled due to COVID-19, and in 2021, Kardashian initiated divorce proceedings against Kanye, citing irreconcilable differences. Despite their separation, the SKIMS founder incorporated a piece from West's frequent collaborator, Balenciaga, into her attire for that year's Met Gala. She opted for a black skin-tight suit that completely concealed her body, including her face.

This year, when Kardashian made her entrance at the 2024 Met Gala in a corset dress that dramatically cinched her waist, it sparked outrage among onlookers. As she ascended the stairs of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she was adorned in an intricate John Galliano for Maison Margiela gown that accentuated her midriff to strikingly slender proportions. ​According to The Mirror, Kardashian completed her ensemble with a grey cropped John Galliano cardigan draped over her shoulders.

Bekommen Kanye West und Bianca Censori schon bald Nachwuchs?,"Kanye West (46) und Bianca Censori (29) überraschten im Jahr 2022 alle mit ihrer Hochzeit. Seitdem beweisen der Rapper und die Designerin immer wieder mit öffentlichen Auftritten ihre Zuneigung füreinander. Jetzt tauschen sich auf Reddit aber vermehrt Fans aus, ob Ye und Bianca wohl schon in freudiger Erwartung sind. Der Grund: Sie haben sich seit mehreren Wochen nicht mehr zusammen blicken lassen. ""Deshalb haben wir ihn seit 8372 Tagen nicht mehr in der Öffentlichkeit gesehen, weil er nicht ohne Bianca rausgeht und sie noch nicht verraten wollen, dass sie schwanger ist"", meint etwa ein User. Außerdem deutete der Musiker in seinem neuen Song ""Timbo Freestyle"" an, dass er gern schon bald mehr Kinder haben möchte: ""Ihr wisst bereits, dass ich impulsiv bin und ein weiteres Baby mein Ziel ist"", lautet die Zeile, die die Reddit-Nutzer ebenfalls als Beweis nehmen.
Auch Bianca soll von Kindern mit Ye nicht unbedingt abgeneigt sein. ""Er ist ihr Ehemann, also haben sie natürlich darüber gesprochen. Und dass sie Stiefmutter von Kanyes Kindern ist, hat ihren Wunsch, Kinder zu haben, nur noch verstärkt"", meinte vor wenigen Monaten ein Insider gegenüber Daily Mail. All diese Aussagen führen also dazu, dass einige Fans nun vermuten, dass es bei dem Ehepaar schon bald so weit sein könnte.
Kanye ist bereits Vater von vier Kindern. Gemeinsam mit seiner Ex-Frau Kim Kardashian (43) teilt er sich die beiden Töchter North (10) und Chicago (6) und die beiden Söhne Saint (8) und Psalm (5). Nach ihrer Scheidung teilen sie sich das Sorgerecht und Ye bemüht sich, ein guter Vater für seine vier Sprösslinge zu sein.

Those who watched “The Roast of Tom Brady” live on Sunday night heard the audience erupt into boos when Kim Kardashian took the stage. However, Netflix has since edited out the negative reaction.
The streaming giant removed the awkward moment from the final three-hour version of the show, which dropped shortly after the live special aired.
In the original version, Kardashian was invited on stage by comedian Kevin Hart to give a “special toast.” However, after arriving at the podium to start her roast, the audience received a wave of boos.

The negative energy stopped the reality TV star in her tracks, forcing Hart to come to her defense.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Hart told the crowd, urging them to settle down.
Kardashian — who stunned in a strapless leather dress — held her ground and got the audience to quiet down.
“All right, all right, all right,” she said while scanning the room before launching into her set.

In the newly edited version, Kardashian simply walks on stage, gives Hart a high five and begins her material without any noticeable sneers from the crowd.
During her short set, the Skims founder joked about Hart’s height, her rumored romance with Brady and her relationship history.
“I wasn’t going to come tonight,” she quipped, “but since I’m not here as Tom’s date, there’s still a good chance I might.
“Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were and I’d never say if we did or not, I’d just release the tape,” she continued, referencing her and Ray J’s 2007 sex tape.

Although the audience seemed to warm up to Kardashian, she also came under fire during several other segments.
The seven-time Super Bowl champion dissed the reality star’s rocky relationship with ex-husband Kanye West when it was finally his turn to talk.
“I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight,” the former quarterback, 46, told audience members. “Not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad.”
When the camera cut to Kardashian, she maintained a tight-lipped smile — despite seemingly shooting daggers at Brady.

However, the Skkn founder wasn’t the only woman in Brady’s life who was left upset by some of the jokes Sunday night.
His ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, was reportedly “deeply disappointed” by the “disrespectful” jokes made about her and Brady’s ill-fated marriage.
“As always, [Bündchen’s] priority is to support her children who were affected by the irresponsible content that was broadcasted,” a source told People.
The insider noted that Bündchen has been focused on the “devastating floods” in her home country of Brazil all week and “to hear her life being joked about was very disappointing.”",2024-05-07T23:54:57Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
Kanye West Seemingly Cancels Yeezy Porn As Every Single Piece Promo Evaporates Into The Ether,"Kanye West knows how to shock the public and create a whirlwind of headlines. That was especially the case when the highly controversial Georgia multi-hyphenate announced YEEZY Porn. He has always had a fascination with the adult industry, as it was evident in his music and in interviews. While it was not a surprise to everyone, it certainly had people upset regardless. ""Reflects insane on twitter when Kanye saying ""I love Hitler"" isn't his most universally hated thing on here,"" one X user wrote.
What also set a lot of people off was an announcement teaser. ""4 24 24 YEEZY PORN IS CUMMING,"" it read. Whether or not Ye did it on purpose, he still wound up deactivating his X account after the backlash. Now, on top of getting off the platform once again, it has been revealed that Kanye West has also removed the aforementioned YEEZY Porn promo video from his YouTube. According to a post from Kurrco, ""Kanye has reportedly abandoned the idea of launching 'YZY P*RN.' All announcement posts have already been taken down.""

YEEZY Porn May Be Kaput, But Kanye West Is Unpredictable
It is not clear where this information came from, but this is predictable Ye. While it seems like this idea could be in the trash for now, do not count him out just yet. There was already a lot of hype from potential collaborator and veteran of the adult industry, Mike Moz. ""I’ve been having discussions with Ye about a potential collab between Yeezy brand and my team at Vixen Media Group. While it’s too early to give any details I’m excited about where Ye’s vision takes this,"" he said. ""The idea that this project is going to be another porn studio is not correct. It will be like nothing we’ve ever seen before.”
What are your thoughts on Kanye West seemingly trashing his YEEZY Porn idea after deleting its campaign promo? Do you think he will bring this back to light sooner or later, why or why not? If this is totally over with, was this the right move from Ye? We would like to hear what you have to say, so be sure to leave your takes in the comments section.

Here's How Kim Kardashian Reacted to Tom Brady's Kanye West Diss At Netflix Comedy Fest,"It was a 'night of roasts' dedicated to the former NFL champion Tom Brady where he was accompanied by his friends, colleagues, and teammates at the Netflix comedy special. Among the attendees was reality star Kim Kardashian who was surprised by a joke made by Brady who took a dig at her controversial ex-husband, Kanye West.

The retired quarterback took the stage and quipped, ""I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight not because of this but because her kids are at home with their dad."" Brady's remark, meant to be funny, didn't impress Kardashian, as per Page Six.
As the camera panned to the SKIMS mogul, the 43-year-old held an uncomfortable smile while shaking her head. Meanwhile, the rest of the audience gasped out loud at the diss and then clapped at Brady's mockery of Ye's bond with his kids.
Tom Brady roasted Kim Kardashian & Kanye West parenting skills tonight 😭😭pic.twitter.com/KisHiT51jP — FearBuck (@FearedBuck) May 6, 2024
The Yeezy founder is a proud father to 10-year-old North, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4. West and Kardashian were married for six years before parting ways in November 2022 after the rapper's unhinged behavior online, followed by massive backlash for his anti-semitic remarks, strained their relationship.
Since their divorce, Kardashian has had a few casual relationships, while West married his former employee, architect Bianca Censori, two months post the finalization of their divorce. The former couple have been trying to co-parent their four kids since, keeping their differences aside which the Hulu star admitted in an interview as ""really f*****g hard.""
On Angie Martinez's IRL podcast in December 2022, Kardashian shared, ""If they don't know things that are being said, why would I ever bring that energy to them?"" describing how she protected her kids from the outrageous headlines about their controversial father. ""That is real, heavy, grownup s–t that they are not ready to deal with. When they are, we will have those conversations. One day, my kids will thank me for not sitting here and bashing their dad.""

In a separate interview with Vogue in February 2022, the mother of four detailed how she never belittles or speaks ill about West in front of their kids, ""You could be so hurt or angry at your ex, but I think in front of the kids, it always has to be 'Your dad's the best. Make sure you are your co-parent's biggest cheerleader, no matter what you're personally going through.""
The billionaire dated Pete Davidson and Odell Beckham Jr. after her divorce from West, rumor mills revealed she was romantically involved with Brady at some point. Kardashian addressed the same on the Netflix joke fest, referring to her infamous sex tape from the past. ""Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were, and I'd never say if we did or not, I'd just release the tape.""",2024-05-07T11:01:44Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Weshalb fehlten Kanye West und Bianca bei der Met Gala?,"Gestern war es wieder so weit: Anna Wintour (74) versammelte Hollywoods Stars und Sternchen im Metropolitan Museum of Art zur alljährlichen Met Gala. Auf die Gästeliste der Benefizveranstaltung schaffen es in jedem Jahr nur die angesagtesten Promis. Doch wo war der erfolgreiche Rapper Kanye West (46)? Von ihm und seiner Frau Bianca Censori (29) fehlte auf dem diesjährigen Fashion-Event jede Spur. Angaben von Daily Mail zufolge gibt es für die Abwesenheit auch einen bestimmten Grund! Der vierfache Vater wird bereits seit zwei Jahren nicht mehr eingeladen, da Anna schwor, nach seinen antisemitischen Äußerungen nie wieder mit ihm zu arbeiten.
Doch schon bevor der Rapper bei der Gastgeberin der Met Gala in Ungnade fiel, hatte Kanye die Benefizveranstaltung des Öfteren geschwänzt. Das letzte Mal besuchte der Modedesigner das Event in Begleitung seiner damaligen Frau Kim Kardashian (43) im Jahr 2019. Doch statt sich wie die anderen Gäste in Schale zu werfen, erschien der Musiker in einem extrem legeren Look. Ganz simpel hatte er lediglich eine schwarze Bomberjacke mit dunklen Jeans kombiniert.
Kanyes Verflossene Kim zählte hingegen zu den geladenen Gästen des Abends. Mit ihrem Met-Gala-Look sorgte die Reality-TV-Bekanntheit auch in diesem Jahr für einen echten Hingucker. Die 43-Jährige präsentierte sich in einem maßgeschneiderten Kleid von Maison Margiela, das ihre Taille winzig erscheinen ließ. Die Fans versetzte sie mit diesen extremen Kurven in Aufruhr. ""Wie viele Rippen hat sich Kim dafür entfernen lassen?"", wunderte sich nicht nur ein User auf Instagram.

Scheidung von Bianca? Kanye Wests Villa wird leer geräumt,"Um Kanye West (46) und Bianca Censoris (29) Ehe soll es nicht gerade gut stehen. Seit Wochen wird darüber spekuliert, ob die beiden sich langsam aber sicher auf eine Scheidung zubewegen. Nun gibt es neue Hinweise auf ein mögliches Liebes-Aus: Wie es aussieht, findet ein Umzug statt! Fotos, die Mirror vorliegen, zeigen eine Reihe von Umzugshelfern vor der Villa des Rappers in Los Angeles. Die Arbeiter räumten am vergangenen Sonntag Möbel und Kisten aus dem Haus in einen Van, unter anderem Sportequipment. Weder Kanye noch seine Frau waren anwesend, während ihre persönlichen Gegenstände abtransportiert wurden.
Erst vor wenigen Wochen kam es zwischen den Eheleuten zum Eklat. Der Skandalmusiker soll einen Mann angegriffen haben, der sich an der Australierin vergehen wollte. ""Der Angreifer stieß nicht nur mit ihr [Bianca] zusammen. Er steckte seine Hände unter ihr Kleid, direkt auf ihren Körper, er packte sie an der Taille, drehte sie herum und warf ihr dann Küsse zu. Sie wurde misshandelt und missbraucht"", gaben Vertreter von Kanye laut TMZ bekannt. Der Ex von Kim Kardashian (43) reagierte schnell und schlug dem Unbekannten angeblich ins Gesicht. Gefiel Bianca diese Reaktion etwa nicht? Der Angriff soll die ohnehin schon angespannte Stimmung zwischen den beiden verstärkt haben.
Das Verfahren wegen der Schlägerei soll nun bereits eingestellt werden. Doch dem ""Black Skinhead""-Interpreten drohen noch weitere Gerichtsprozesse: Erst vor wenigen Tagen wurde er erneut von einem Ex-Mitarbeiter verklagt, wie The Wrap berichtet. Kanye wird vorgeworfen, seine Angestellten aufgrund ihrer Hautfarbe ""schwer diskriminiert, belästigt und schikaniert"" zu haben. Die neuen Vorwürfe reihen sich ein in zahllose Anschuldigungen wegen Gesundheits- und Sicherheitsverstößen sowie rechtswidriger Erziehungspraktiken.

Tom Brady Jabs at Kanye West While Roasting Kim Kardashian: Watch,"Tom Brady was the latest subject of Netflix’s Greatest Roast of All Time on Sunday night (May 5), and there was a point when the iconic New England Patriots quarterback went on the offensive and singled out Kim Kardashian in the audience.

While pointing out the reality TV star, Brady jabbed at her ex-husband Ye — the artist formerly known as Kanye West — and sniped the rapper about his parenting skills to the former couple’s four children.
“Kim Kardashian, thank you so much for being here,” the football star began his setup. “I know Kim was terrified to be here tonight — not because of this, but because her kids are home with their dad.”
Trending on Billboard
The punchline drew laughs from the crowd as they gave Brady an ovation.
Kardashian even took the podium to roast Tom later in the night and addressed the rumors of them dating in the past. She appeared to be booed while coming up to the stage.
“I’m really here tonight for Tom. I wasn’t going to come tonight, but since I’m not here as Tom’s date, there’s still a good chance I might,” she said. “Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were, and I’d never say if we did or not. I’d just release the tape.”
The SKIMS founder continued by comparing Brady to her stepparent, Caitlyn Jenner: “I do know it would never work out. An ex-athlete, high cheekbones, silky hair, you remind me too much of my stepdad now. Part of me thinks you would want to undress me, just to try on my clothes.”
Ye and Kim tied the knot in Italy with a wedding in 2014. The couple had four children together: North, Saint, Psalm and Chicago. They finalized their divorce in November 2022.
Prior to the dig, West and Brady have seemingly been on good terms. While the football star was still playing in the NFL, Ye brought his son Saint to hang with Brady before a Tampa Bay Buccaneers game in November 2021.
Subsequent footage of the meetup went viral, featuring West’s commentary of TB12 having a catch with Saint.

Kanye West ‘Broke Down’ After Knowing Daughter North West Wants a ‘Simple Life’ With Him,"Editor's note: This article was originally published on November 25, 2023. It has since been updated.
Kanye West may have taken a hiatus from the world of making music ever since he dealt with backlash for his antisemitic comments in the past. Not only did his career take a dip, but also his marriage with ex-wife Kim Kardashian completely fell apart like a domino effect. However, just a month after his divorce from Kardashian was finalized, he went on to marry his Yeezy colleague Bianca Censori and appeared to be happy. Regardless of his career and complicated love life, West is a very dedicated father and loves all his children dearly. Especially, his daughter North. This is why he allegedly felt torn apart after hearing North’s earnest cry on a recent episode of The Kardashians and decided to spend some quality time with her.

According to The Daily Mail, the Runaway singer watched the episode in which his daughter complained of living in her $60 Million Calabasas mansion surrounded by luxury, nannies to take care of her, and ample security. On the reality television series, Kardashian got very candid about her daughter North’s outbursts and her parenting journey as a single mother.

Kardashian gave an account of the time her daughter spent time with her father’s place and returned wanting the same lifestyle as her dad. Kardashian said: “She’ll go to her dad’s, she’ll be like, Dad is the best. He has it all figured out. He doesn’t have a nanny. He doesn’t have a chef. He doesn’t have security. He lives in an apartment.” She adds: “And she’ll start crying, ‘Why don’t you have an apartment? I can’t believe we don’t have an apartment!”
This reportedly broke her dear father’s heart when he watched it…A source close to West claimed that “Kanye needed to spend time with North” after he took notice of her reaction. The source elaborates on the rapper’s reaction: “After he saw what Kim said on the show he broke down because he realizes how much North needs him.” Furthermore, the source alleges: “Hearing this from Kim about North angered Kanye and made him very upset.” Lastly, the source claimed that North was very much a “daddy’s girl” and her father desperately misses seeing her every day.

It didn’t take long for the American Boy rapper to react and so after talks with his ex-wife, he whisked her away for a daddy-daughter trip to Dubai earlier this month. But the twist was, he didn’t take Censori along. Usually, when he’s spending time with North, Censori is almost always spotted by paparazzi alongside the duo. For her to be ditched on the trip is strange indeed.

A source claimed that “Kanye needed to spend time with North [alone] and Bianca understood it.” In light of recent events, neither West nor Censori nor their representatives have issued a comment.",2024-05-06T12:08:19Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
A-listers who dabbled in X-rated films - including Sylvester Stallone’s ‘orgy porno’ & Friends star’s erotic thriller,"HOLLYWOOD stars are often known to get naked in the name of art - but many have gone one step further.
Rap superstar Kanye West is, bizarrely, planning to join the ranks of stars who have dabbled in the world of pornography.

The 46-year-old musician recently announced his decision to launch Yeezy Porn, an adult film studio he revealed on Instagram.
And, according to TMZ, he has been in talks with porn star Stormy Daniels' ex-husband Mike Moz, who's been a porn producer for over a decade.
Mike - whose credits include Aroused, Vixen and Young Fantasies 7 - is expected to be named the head of Kanye's mature vision.
But the road to Hollywood is long and winding, and Kanye isn't the first star to turn his hand to something a little more lowbrow.
We reveal the A-listers who starred in much more revealing roles before they got their big break - and those who joined the X-rated world even after fame.
Snoop Dogg
Kanye isn't the first rapper to try and make it big in the adult entertainment world.
Back in 2001, Snoop Dogg released Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle - a mixed hardcore pornography and music video shot at his home in California.
The video was a wild success and won two awards at the Adult Video News Awards for best music and best selling tape of 2001.
The 86-minute long tape features several songs from Snoop's discography and multiple popular porn stars .
Doggystyle was so popular, Snoop released another porno the following year called Hustlaz: Diary of a Pimp under the name Snoop Scorsese.
‘Only seen it once,’ moan Walmart shoppers after Snoop Dogg sues retailer for ‘keeping his cereal off shelves’
In the film, Snoop plays a pimp who is hosting a wild party with more than 40 porn stars and convinces a journalist to become one of the girls working for him.
His second film reached the same dizzying heights as the first, again taking home two awards at the AVN Awards - top-selling release of the year and best ethnic-themed release.
Sylvester Stallone
14 Sylvester got $200 for soft core porn film The Party at Kitty and Stud's

Before he was Rocky Balboa and Rambo, Sylvester Stallone was just another struggling artist, living in a bus station, trying to find work.
So when the opportunity to be in some soft-core porn presented itself, the Hollywood icon took the chance.
""It was either do that movie or rob someone because I was at the end -- at the very end -- of my rope,"" Sylvester told Playboy. ""Instead of doing something desperate, I worked two days for $200.""
The film, initially called The Party at Kitty and Stud’s, focused around an orgy at a New York couple's house and runs for just over 70 minutes.
After Sylvester became a huge star with Rocky, the owners of the porn tape attempted to sell him the rights to it for $100,000 (£80.1k) to prevent its re-release, but Sylvester told them he “wouldn’t buy it for two bucks”.
The movie was re-released with a new name - The Italian Stallion - and, in 2010, the rights were sold on eBay for a jaw-dropping $400,000 (£320.3k).
Dame Helen Mirren

Before she became a Dame for her services to drama, Helen Mirren starred in the erotic historical drama Caligula as Caesonia - the titular character's wife.
The 1979 film was described by Helen as ""an irresistible mixture of art and genitals"" but by critic Roger Ebert as ""sickening, utterly worthless, shameless trash"".
Produced by Penthouse, the film follows Caligula's sex-fuelled, bloody rise and fall from power.
And Helen has described being on set as ""like showing up in a nudist camp every day"".
The film was marred by controversy as, after filming had concluded, financier and founder of Penthouse Bob Guccione and producer Giancarlo Lui snuck into the studios and filmed several hardcore sex scenes using girls from Penthouse.
These were then put into the final cut, which caused the director Tinto Brass to remove himself from the work entirely.
He is listed just as the principle photographer.
Matt LeBlanc

Before he became a household name as the charming lead man of the iconic sitcom Friends, Matt LeBlanc had another much raunchier role.
In 1993, he starred as sexy bike messenger Kyle in the TV series The Red Shoe Diaries.
The Playboy-produced series was famed for its erotic, female-focused plots.
And Matt played one of law firm receptionist Trudie's lovers in two separate episodes.

Matt was not the only 90s star to find fame from soft-core porn, as X Files star David Duchovny also featured in the Red Shoe Diaries.
However, he was the show's narrator Jake Winters - who discovers his girlfriend was having affairs, after reading her diary when she kills herself.
In order to reconcile with this, Jake spends his time asking women to write to him about their love affairs - which in turn, create the steamy sequences that make the show.
As the show's narrator, David wasn't onscreen for the most part - but he features in one episode.
Chloe Cherry

Legally born Elise Marilyn Jones, Chloe Cherry found fame as Faye - the blonde, dazed girlfriend of a drug dealer in the teen drama Euphoria.
She's been described as one of the breakout stars of the show, but Chloe had already been acting as a porn star since she moved to Miami at the age of 18.
By 2019 she had starred in over 200 films and was also using OnlyFans to sell pornographic content.
However, Chloe has confessed she's recovering from an eating disorder, after producers on the set of her pornographic films told her she was fat and needed to lose weight.
I'd rather just kind of stop...and have that really awesome porn career that went really well rather than trying to do more with it. Chloe Cherry
Chloe ultimately began consuming 200 calories or less a day.
She has now stopped performing in porn, due to her age, and so that she can move into screen acting.
Explaining her decision to retire from porn on Emily Ratajkowski's podcast High Low, Chloe said: ""Yes, I'm only 25. Like I have plenty of time to do it but I figured I would stop now while I'm ahead rather than wait until I age out of something.
""I'd rather just kind of stop, and put a cap in it, and just tie it up in a nice bow, and have that really awesome porn career that went really well rather than trying to do more with it.
""If I were to be put on a scene with somebody the girl or guy like they might be like, 'Holy s**t, it's Chloe Cherry,'
""I'm just not comfortable with being seen as the celebrity of porn stars like it's just with the nature of the industry with the way things work.""
Skepta

He's a hardcore grime rapper but in 2011 Skepta starred in his own hardcore porn video for his song All Over the House.
The music video featured several porn stars going at it, as the title suggests, all over the house, while Skepta, 41, spits bars in the background.
The video went viral and caused controversy as people fumed over it going too far - but Skepta insisted he hadn't really done anything wrong.
He told the BBC: ""The video was not uploaded to YouTube, I didn't keep retweeting about it and it was uploaded on to a site where it was allowed to be uploaded with a big warning saying '18s only'.""
Jon Hamm

Jon Hamm is now one of the most famous actors in the world, having starred in everything from Bridesmaids to Mad Men.
But, while struggling to find work in Hollywood in his 20s, he worked as a waiter, as well as on softcore porn films.
Speaking on Dana Carvey and David Spade's Fly on the Wall podcast, he said: “There were certainly no genitals touched. I was in the art department, believe it or not.
“It was softcore porn, Skinemax late night what not, we shot in these dismal, dingy places in downtown LA, these stages…
“It was some dude in a sock and a lady with patches on her whatevers.

Nick Fuentes thanked social media site X’s CEO Elon Musk for restoring his X (formerly Twitter) account on Saturday.
“Thank you Elon Musk for reinstating my account and upholding your commitment to free speech. I have been censored on every major platform for +3 years. Much has been said about me in that time by groups like ADL and SPLC… I look forward to reintroducing myself in my own words!” Fuentes said after his account was restored.
Fuentes was referring to the Southern Poverty Law Centre (SPLC) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in his tweet.
Thank you @elonmusk for reinstating my account and upholding your commitment to free speech.I have been censored on every major platform for +3 years. Much has been said about me in that time by groups like ADL and SPLC… I look forward to reintroducing myself in my own words! — Nicholas J. Fuentes (@NickJFuentes) May 4, 2024
Musk noted the reuqests and assured X users that Fuentes account will be reinstated provided that he does not violate the law. “It is better to have anti whatever out in the open to be rebutted than grow simmering in the darkness,” Musk wrote.
Very well, he will be reinstated, provided he does not violate the law, and let him be crushed by the comments and Community Notes. It is better to have anti whatever out in the open to be rebutted than grow simmering in the darkness. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 2, 2024
Notably, Hannah Gais, a senior researcher at Southern Poverty Law Center, last year told news agency Reuters in 2023, shortly after his account was banned, that Fuentes made several antisemitic comments. His account was briefly restored last year but was banned following an outrage among netizens.
The white supremacist was suspended from several social media platforms for hate speech in 2020 and 2021, including Facebook and YouTube, in addition to Twitter (now known as X), according to a report by Reuters.
Fuentes made headlines in 2022 when Donald Trump hosted him and Ye, the critically acclaimed rapper-singer-songwriter, formerly known as Kanye West, at his private club in Florida. The former US president said that the meeting happened inadvertently.
Ye has also drawn widespread criticism, for a spate of antisemitic comments and was suspended recently from social media platforms.",2024-05-04T06:55:00Z,https://www.news18.com,News18

Kendrick Lamar met le feu aux poudres
Tout commence évidemment par une chanson. Le 22 mars, le producteur Metro Boomin, originaire de Saint Louis (Missouri), et Future, le rappeur d'Atlanta (Georgie), dévoilent leur album commun We Don't Trust You. Y figure le titre Like That avec Kendrick Lamar, dans lequel le rappeur chante ""Motherfuck The Big Three, N..., It's Just Big Me"" (""Nique sa mère, le top trois, N..., c'est juste moi"").
Kendrick Lamar répond alors au titre First Person Shooter , qui réunissait Drake et le rappeur J. Cole, paru sur l'album du premier, For All The Dogs, en octobre. J. Cole y fait référence au ""Big Three"", le Top 3 des rappeurs actuels, à savoir lui, Drake et... Kendrick Lamar. Ce trio s'est fait connaître au début des années 2010 et ses membres ont collaboré sur plusieurs titres.
En 2013, déjà, Kendrick Lamar avait pris à partie ses rivaux dans le titre Control . Plus de dix ans après, le rap et ses acteurs s'agitent toujours autour de la seule question qui vaille dans ce milieu musical : qui est le numéro un ? Cette rime de Kendrick Lamar dans Like That prend une ampleur particulière, car elle apparaît sur le projet de Future et Metro Boomin, deux artistes habitués à collaborer avec Drake. Mais ces deux-là avaient commencé à prendre leurs distances avec la star de Toronto. Sans qu'on sache réellement pourquoi.
J. Cole répond avant de faire volte-face
Les répercussions ne vont pas tarder à se faire sentir. J. Cole dégaine d'abord en sortant, par surprise, son album Might Delete Later, le 5 avril. Il répond, sans le nommer, à Kendrick Lamar avec le titre 7 Minute Drill qui clôt l'opus. ""Il fait encore des concerts, mais il a régressé comme les Simpson. Ton premier projet était un classique, ton dernier était tragique. Ton deuxième projet a endormi tout le monde, on l'a surcoté. Ton troisième projet était massif et c'était ton 'prime'"", déclame-t-il, faisant référence aux albums de Kendrick Lamar.
J. Cole possède pourtant la réputation d'être un rappeur plutôt respectueux et bienveillant, loin des frasques auxquelles on peut associer certains de ses concurrents. S'il avait bien attaqué Kanye West, sans le nommer toujours, sur False Prophets en 2016, un de ses rares titres virulents, Jermaine Cole de son vrai nom est loin d'être un habitué des clashs. Une réputation qu'il va confirmer deux jours plus tard.
Sur la scène du Dreamville Fest à Raleigh (Caroline du Nord) le 6 et 7 avril, J. Cole se confond en excuses après son ""diss track"" contre Kendrick Lamar. ""Je suis très fier de Might Delete Later, à l'exception d'une partie. Ce morceau me donne l'impression que c'est le projet le plus nul que j'aie fait de ma vie"", déclare-t-il. ""Je me suis éloigné de la voie que j'ai empruntée ces dix dernières années"", ajoute-t-il avant de demander au public s'il pense que Kendrick Lamar ""est l'un des meilleurs rappeurs de l'histoire ?"" ""Vous l'aimez n'est-ce pas ?"" renchérit-il. Le public approuve. ""Moi aussi"", répond-il.
""J'ai déconné. Je prie pour qu'il ne l'ait pas mal pris. Je m'excuse auprès de vous tous."" J. Cole, rappeur sur la scène du Dreamville Fest
Le titre disparaît des plateformes, mais J. Cole n'a pas fini de surprendre. Vendredi 12 avril sort We Still Don't Trust You, la suite du projet de Future et Metro Boomin qui a mis le feu aux poudres. Et qui retrouve-t-on sur Red Leather, le dernier titre ? J. Cole ! Une présence très surprenante, même s'il n'attaque pas directement Drake dans son couplet.
The Weeknd, A$AP Rocky et Kanye West s'en mêlent
Ce second projet, We Still Don't Trust You, est le plus virulent à l'encontre de Drake. Plusieurs invités de marque le prennent pour cible : A$AP Rocky, poids lourd du rap américain, natif de New York ; The Weeknd, l'autre popstar canadienne, mondialement connue, mais aussi Kanye West. Le premier, en couple avec Rihanna, se paye Drake, qui a lui aussi été sensible par le passé aux charmes de l'interprète d'Umbrella. ""Ces n****s jurent qu'ils ont les plus méchantes des meufs, je viens d'attraper la plus méchante. Ces n****s ont des sentiments à l'égard des femmes, quoi, tu es blessé ou quelque chose comme ça ?"" rappe-t-il sur Show of Hands.
The Weeknd, lui, a également collaboré avec Drake aux débuts des années 2010. Mais il a fini par choisir l'autre camp, celui de Future et Metro Boomin, et attaque Drake, notamment sur sa propension à s'afficher sur les réseaux sociaux : ""Ils ne pourront jamais s'en prendre à mes frères, bébé. Je remercie Dieu de n'avoir jamais renoncé à ma vie. Leurs shooters font des TikTok"", chante-t-il sur All To Myself .
Kanye West, pour sa part, s'est déjà brouillé avec Drake avant de se réconcilier en 2021. Invité sur le remix de Like That , le titre sur lequel Kendrick Lamar a déclenché les hostilités, Kanye West s'en prend au Canadien et à J. Cole. ""Vous êtes si loin des yeux et de l'esprit. Je ne peux même pas penser à une phrase de Drake. Jouez J. Cole, pour bien vous ennuyer"", tance-t-il. Interviewé durant le podcast The Download, Kanye West a raconté avoir été contacté par Future : ""Je suis allé au studio, j'ai posé ça et ensuite nous avons suivi le processus créatif... Vous savez, tout le monde était très, très excité par l'élimination de Drake. Pas excités, nous étions pleins d'énergie.""
Drake finit par riposter
Après des semaines à subir les attaques et à se contenter de messages sur les réseaux sociaux pour dire qu'""il garde la tête haute"" ou s'amuser avec l'actrice Uma Thurman qui lui demandait s'il avait besoin de son costume de Kill Bill pour se défendre , Drake répond en musique avec le titre Push Ups, le 13 avril. Il s'amuse de ce qu'il définit comme ""un 20 contre 1"" et tout le monde en prend pour son grade. Future ? ""Je ne pourrai jamais être le fan numéro un de personne, dit-il. Ton premier numéro un, je te l'ai offert sur un plateau"", en référence au titre Way 2 Sexy, sorti en 2021 sur un album de Drake, qui a valu à Future sa première apparition en tête du classement Billboard.
Le producteur Metro Boomin ? ""J'ai plus d'amour que toi dans ta propre ville. Metro, ferme ton c... et fais des 'drums'."" Il répond également à Rick Ross, autre poids lourd du rap américain, qui l'a attaqué, avec le titre Champagne Moments. ""Ce n*** fête ses 50 ans, chaque chanson qui a figuré dans les charts était avec Drizzy [un des surnoms que Drake se donne]"", assure-t-il.
Mais la cible numéro 1 de Drake reste Kendrick Lamar. ""Comment peux-tu te considérer comme un grand homme alors que tu fais du 40 ?"" se moque-t-il, la pointure de Kendrick Lamar servant d'illustration au titre. Il attaque aussi le rappeur californien sur ses collaborations avec Maroon 5 et Taylor Swift. ""Tu n'es pas dans le Top 3. SZA t'a effacé, Travis t'a effacé, Savage t'a effacé comme tous les gens de ton label..."" ajoute-t-il, citant trois autres grands noms du rap.
Une autre réponse va suivre quelques jours plus tard avec le titre Taylor Made Freestyle , réalisé avec de l'intelligence artificielle pour faire apparaître les voix de Tupac et Snoop Dogg. Pourquoi eux ? Ce sont deux légendes de la côte ouest, d'où est originaire Kendrick Lamar, afin de lui mettre la pression, lui qui n'a toujours plus donné signe de vie depuis le début de l'affaire.
Kendrick Lamar sort de son silence
Kendrick Lamar rompt le silence mardi 30 avril avec le titre Euphoria, référence à la série avec Zendaya, dont Drake est l'un des producteurs. Pendant plus de six minutes, le rappeur californien s'en prend à Drake, évoquant dès les premières secondes un ""célèbre acteur que nous connaissions autrefois"", en référence au rôle tenu par son rival dans la série pour adolescents Degrassi : La Nouvelle Génération.
Il s'y présente comme le ""Biggest Hater"" (""le plus gros haineux"") du Canadien. ""Je déteste la façon dont tu marches, la façon dont tu parles, je déteste la façon dont tu t'habilles, ajoute-t-il. J'aime Drake avec les mélodies, je n'aime pas Drake quand il joue les durs."" Sur Instagram, le natif de Toronto a simplement réagi en postant un extrait du film Dix bonnes raisons de te larguer avec des émojis clin d'œil et cœur brisé. Dans cette scène du film, l'héroïne, interprétée par Julia Stiles, récite un poème d'amour-haine au garçon dont elle est amoureuse. Ce poème commence par ""Je déteste la façon dont tu me parles et la façon dont tu te coupes les cheveux"".
Kendrick Lamar revient à la charge
Les choses auraient pu en rester là, mais elles se sont accélérées samedi 4 mai. Kendrick Lamar publie d'abord 6:16 in LA sur Instagram. Le rappeur californien se penche sur les relations de Drake avec son entourage et sous-entend que le label du Canadien, OVO, lui aurait lâché des informations. ""Faux tyran, je déteste les tyrans, tu dois être quelqu'un d'horrible. Tout le monde dans ton équipe murmure que tu le mérites"", rappe-t-il dans son morceau. ""Si tu étais intelligent, tu aurais compris que ton entourage ne sert qu'à t'arnaquer. Une centaine de n*** que tu as rémunérés. Et vingt d'entre eux veulent faire de toi une victime. Et l'un d'entre eux est en fait à côté de toi. Et deux d'entre eux sont lassés de ton style de vie, mais n'ont pas l'audace de te le dire"", poursuit Kendrick Lamar.
Drake réplique avec une chanson et un clip
Ce titre lance une salve de morceaux qui vont se succéder samedi. Drake publie d'abord Family Matters. Il s'en prend à nouveau à la petite taille de son rival (""Quand tu mets la main sur ta copine, est-ce de la légitime défense parce qu'elle est plus grande que toi ?"") et attaque aussi la vie privée du Californien. ""Pourquoi tu n'as jamais pris ton fils dans tes bras pour lui dire 'cheese' ? On aurait pu laisser les enfants en dehors de ça, ne me blâme pas"", lance-t-il avant de sous-entendre qu'un des deux enfants de son rival serait en fait le fils de Dave Free, le manager de Kendrick Lamar. Drake accuse également Kendrick Lamar de battre sa femme : ""Ils ont engagé une équipe de gestion de crise pour nettoyer le fait que tu battais ta reine. Le tableau que vous avez peint n'est pas ce qu'il semble être."" Le clip lui-même est une attaque puisqu'on voit un Dodge Van, le même que celui de la pochette de l'album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City de Kendrick Lamar, finir broyé à la casse.
Kendrick Lamar sort deux nouveaux titres
Moins d'une heure après Family Matters, Kendrick Lamar répond avec Meet the Grahams , où il s'adresse aux membres de la famille de Drake. D'abord à son fils Adonis : ""Cher Adonis, je suis désolé que cet homme soit ton père."" Ensuite, au père, Dennis : ""Cher Dennis, vous avez donné naissance à un maître de la manipulation. (...) Vous avez élevé une putain de personne horrible."" Puis à Sandra, sa mère : ""Votre fils est un homme malade avec des pensées malades, je pense que les hommes comme lui devraient mourir."" Il termine son titre avec des paroles pour une fille, qu'il ne nomme pas, sous-entendant que Drake a un autre enfant caché : ""Il devrait t'apprendre les tables de multiplications ou regarder 'La Reine des neiges' avec toi. Ou à ton onzième anniversaire, chanter des poèmes avec toi.""
Mais Kendrick Lamar en a encore sous le pied et publie dans la foulée Not Like Us. Sur la pochette du titre, on voit le manoir de Drake, marqué de tags prouvant la présence de délinquants sexuels dans la demeure. Kendrick Lamar accuse Drake d'être un pédophile : ""Amoureux certifié [en référence à un titre d'album de Drake]... Pédophile certifié."" Il ajoute également que Drake est un ""colonisateur"", le Canadien se servant de collègues rappeurs (Future, Young Thug) pour asseoir sa crédibilité.
Drake contre-attaque encore
Ce n'est pas fini. Le rappeur canadien publie lundi 6 mai le titre The Heart Part 6, avec en pochette un message de Dave Free, le producteur de Kendrick Lamar, avec des cœurs. Dans cette chanson, il affirme avoir donné de fausses informations pour qu'elles parviennent jusqu'à Kendrick Lamar, afin que ce dernier les utilise : ""Nous avons comploté pendant une semaine et nous t'avons donné l'information : une fille de 11 ans, je parie qu'il la prend."" Il nie les accusations de pédophilie et promet qu'il aurait déjà été arrêté s'il avait commis ce dont il est accusé. ""Je suis bien trop célèbre pour les conneries que tu viens de suggérer"", ajoute-t-il. Il termine son titre en assurant que ce clash ""était un bon exercice"".
""C'est bien de sortir, de faire fonctionner le stylo."" Drake, rappeur dans sa chanson ""The Heart Part 6""
Il pourrait toutefois bien le ressortir prochainement puisque le producteur Metro Boomin a partagé gratuitement, samedi, sur la plateforme Soundcloud, une production sur laquelle il invite à clasher le rappeur canadien. L'auteur du meilleur titre se verra offrir une production de l'artiste. Une sacrée affaire, donc, puisque le travail du prestigieux producteur se négocie généralement entre 75 000 et 150 000 dollars, selon le site Highsnobiety.com.",2024-05-04T05:15:40Z,https://www.francetvinfo.fr,franceinfo
Is Bianca Censori okay? From unassuming Australian architect to Kanye West’s Barbie doll,"So how does an ordinary architecture post-grad end up marrying one of the most famous men in the world? Well, firstly, she works for him. After working as student architect for three years at Melbourne-based architecture agency DP Toscano, Censori joined Yeezy as an Architectural Designer in 2020 and moved to Los Angeles. Quite the leap, but Censori was gifted. “It was surprising because she was still so young in the profession,” her former boss Joe Toscano told the Sydney Morning Herald. “It was only the fact that it had happened so quickly and so soon, not because I didn’t think that she had the skills to do it [...] She obviously made an impression on Kanye West, and she made that impression because she’s actually very talented.”",2024-05-03T14:52:35Z,https://www.standard.co.uk,Evening Standard
"Kanye West Failed To Drop ""Vultures 2"" And Fans Are Not Happy","Another day, another failed Kanye West rollout. The Chicago rapper was the model of perfectionism in the 2000s, but he's since become the poster child for failing to meet deadlines. West drops whenever he feels like it, and if he doesn't, he doesn't let the fans know. He originally claimed Vultures 2 was going to drop on March 8, but the date came and went with no new music. Radio silence followed, then West said it was going to come out May 3. Well, May 3 has also come and gone, and fans have yet to hear what the sequel to Ye's last album sounds like.
This shouldn't be a surprise. The hours leading up to the supposed Vultures 2 release was characterized by fans setting themselves up for a letdown. Nobody should get their hopes up over a West release date anymore. That being said, the confirmation that Vultures 2 has been delayed is disheartening. Fans flocked to X (formerly Twitter) to make their disappointment known.

""I spend the entire night waiting for Vultures 2 debut only to realize Kanye west was pranking us,"" one frustrated user wrote. Some took the opposite approach, and criticized those who thought the rapper would really deliver. ""If you believed Kanye West was dropping music tonight,"" another tweeted. ""Then that’s your fault.""
Kanye West did technically drop new music tonight, but it was on another album. The rapper had the lone feature on the 4batz album u made me a st4r. The guest verse he provides on the remix to ""act iii: on god? (she said)"" is getting positive feedback from fans. Not enough to stave off the disappointment of no Vultures 2, but enough to keep fans satiated until he actually decides to drop. At this rate, we will be lucky to get Vultures 3 by the end of the year.

X Users Are Unanimously Bummed
The disappointment ran deep on Thursday night/Friday morning. X users resorted to gifs and memes when words failed them. One of the most popular is an actual clip of West saying ""gotcha"" during an interview, which about sums up what happened. Strangely enough, West has never released a sequel album, despite teasing several of them dating back to Watch the Throne 2 (remember that!?). Maybe there's a correlation, maybe not.
Either way, take solace in these reactions.",2024-05-03T04:53:47Z,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com,HotNewHipHop
Demandan a Kanye West por actitudes racistas contra sus empleados negros,"Un exempleado de Kanye West le ha demandado por supuestamente tener actitudes racistas contra sus trabajadores negros, así como por despedirle por negarse a afeitarse la cabeza para trabajar, según publican diversos medios de EE UU.
La denuncia la ha puesto Benjamin Deshon Provo, que en agosto de 2021 empezó a trabajar como guardia de seguridad en la escuela cristiana del rapero, llamada Donda Academy. Según Provo, aquel trabajo le provocó ""angustia emocional severa"".
""Kanye y los miembros de su equipo directivo sometieron a Provo y otros empleados negros a un trato menos favorable que sus homólogos blancos"", dice la demanda.
""Kanye frecuentemente gritaba y reprendía a los empleados negros, mientras que, por el contrario, nunca levantaba el tono de voz hacia el personal blanco"", dicen las acusaciones contra el rapero. ""Era siempre brusco, abrasivo y degradante con el demandante y sus homólogos afroamericanos"", alegan.
Además, en un momento dado, Kanye decidió que el personal debía ir con la cabeza rapada, algo a lo que se negó el empleado, que llevaba rastas como expresión de su religión musulmana. ""De hecho, bajo la dirección de Kanye, a Provo le dieron el ultimátum: se cortaba el pelo o era despedido"", dice la demanda. Se negó a cortarse el pelo, por lo que fue despedido.
""Además, Kanye expresaba regularmente creencias negativas asociadas con destacados líderes negros que defendían o buscaban hacer avanzar a la comunidad negra"", como Martin Luther King Jr. o Malcolm X.",2024-05-02T14:24:09Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos
"Universal’s music is returning to TikTok, ending a spat that hurt fans more than anyone","A longstanding feud between TikTok and Universal Music Group seems to have finally reached an end, with both parties signing a deal that will see Universal-backed music returned to the social media platform.
Universal first removed its artists’ work from TikTok about three months ago, restricting access to tunes from household names such as Billie Eilish, Adele, Harry Styles, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West and Post Malone.
Taylor Swift was initially included this group, but reinstated her offerings ahead of the release of The Tortured Poets Department. Unlike most artists signed with Universal, Swift struck a unique deal that lets her control where her music is played.
While the dust may have finally settled, the Universal music drought left millions of TikTok users with a less than optimal experience for months – and may have put up an unnecessary barrier for Universal’s smaller artists.
The events have also shone a light on just how codependent the music and social media industries are, and how important compromise will be moving forward.
The beef (and resolution) explained
The previous agreement that granted TikTok users access to Universal’s catalogue lasted until January 31, and was worth A$170 million per year for Universal (about 1% of its yearly revenue).
Talks to enter a new agreement reportedly turned hostile, leading to Universal pulling the plug.
In an open letter published on January 30 “to the artist and songwriter community”, Universal said it was concerned about “appropriate compensation” for artists and songwriters, and protecting artists from the harmful effects of AI, among other things.
Universal claimed:
As our negotiations continued, TikTok attempted to bully us into accepting a deal worth less than the previous deal, far less than fair market value and not reflective of their exponential growth.
Universal knows its music is a key part of TikTok users’ experience. It likely wanted a deal that reflected its market dominance, such as one linked to instances of use and a cut of advertising revenue, rather than a lump sum payment.
TikTok offered its own framing on the matter:
Despite Universal’s false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent.
In a recent statement, the companies said the new deal would deliver improved pay terms for Universal’s artists – but stopped short of publicly providing any financial terms or dollar amounts. TikTok also said it would commit to removing unauthorised music generated by artificial intelligence, a growing concern for the music industry.
Music from Universal’s artists is expected to return to the platform in one to two weeks, with muted videos regaining their audio.
Universal’s upper hand
It’s not surprising Universal came out of negotiations with a better deal than it previously had. TikTok is famed for its dance and music-related content, and likely couldn’t afford to go on without access to Universal’s catalogue.
In early 2023, TikTok ran a “trial” restricting some users’ access to major-label music in Australia. The result was a drop in both users and activity.
Past court rulings also suggested the deck would be weighted in Universal’s favour. For instance, one ruling in Germany found that, under European Union regulations, TikTok was liable for unlicensed content appearing on its platform.
A continued boycott from Universal could have proven a nightmare for TikTok, since Universal is the biggest of the big three music publishers (alongside Warner and Sony). It also owns a glut of relatively smaller or “independent” labels, including Capitol, Def Jam, EMI, Island, Polydor and Virgin.
A co-dependant relationship
At the same time, it’s naive to suggest the only benefit Universal gets from TikTok using its music is through the revenue TikTok pays. This would ignore the vast influence TikTok also has on the music industry.
One TikTok trend from this year was inspired by a scene from the Oscar-nominated film Saltburn, where the protagonist dances to Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s 2001 hit Murder on the Dancefloor. Because of TikTok, a song only ever heard at your mate’s wedding temporarily became the epicentre of youth culture.
This is just one example of how TikTok can deliver wins for both parties. That’s not even considering how many Universal artists frequently use TikTok to engage with their fans.
Universal and TikTok win, so who lost?
Even if a deal had not been reached, it would be hard to see either Universal (which made A$17.5 billion in 2022) or TikTok (which made A$14.5 billion) as “victims” or “losers”.
It’s also fair to say Universal’s roughly three-month boycott didn’t hurt any of its headline artists. It was likely the smaller artists, who see close to nothing of the money TikTok pays Universal, would have suffered the most. Beyond that, it was TikTok users who paid the price.
One Rolling Stone article noted the case of Cody Fry, whose track Things You Said was going viral on Douyin (mainland China’s wing of TikTok). But just as he was planning to capitalise on the exposure, his music was pulled.
The same events, in different context, produce different narratives. Legacy artists such as Taylor Swift are “exploited” by TikTok, while emerging artists are “promoted”.
Both corporations have their own case (and money) to make in such squabbles, while the small fry get left behind. Yet the fact that Billboard now publishes a TikTok top 50 chart stands as evidence these two industries need each other.
If they care about listeners and budding talent, they ought to both bend a little to avoid another drought.",2024-05-02T14:00:00Z,https://theconversation.com,The Conversation UK
"Ozzy Osbourne: Τα ""χώνει"" στον Kanye West - Είναι αντισημίτης","Your browser does not support the audio element.
Ο τραγουδιστής των Black Sabbath δήλωσε ότι δεν θέλει να έχει καμία σχέση με τον καλλιτέχνη
Ο Ozzy Osbourne κατηγόρησε τον Kanye West ότι χρησιμοποίησε δείγμα της μουσικής του χωρίς άδεια.
Σε μια ανάρτηση στο X, ο Osbourne ισχυρίζεται ότι αρνήθηκε το αίτημα να χρησιμοποιηθεί στο νέο άλμπουμ του West ένα μέρος από μια ζωντανή έκδοση του τραγουδιού «War Pigs» των Black Sabbath του 1983, αλλά άκουσε ότι χρησιμοποιήθηκε ούτως ή άλλως κατά τη διάρκεια ενός listening party αυτή την εβδομάδα.
Ο Osbourne έγραψε ότι «αρνήθηκε την άδεια επειδή είναι αντισημίτης και έχει προκαλέσει ανείπωτη θλίψη σε πολλούς». Και πρόσθεσε: «Δεν θέλω καμία σχέση με αυτόν τον άνθρωπο!».
Η σύζυγός του, Sharon Osbourne, δήλωσε πρόσφατα στο Jewish Chronicle: «Ο Ιουδαϊσμός είναι η μόνη θρησκεία που έχω και η μόνη με την οποία αισθάνομαι άνετα».

Στην εκδήλωση αυτής της εβδομάδας στο Σικάγο, ο West, γνωστός και ως Ye, και ο Ty Dolla $ign έκαναν πρεμιέρα το κοινό τους project «Vultures». Το άλμπουμ είχε αρχικά προγραμματιστεί να κυκλοφορήσει τον Δεκέμβριο. Τότε είχε αναφερθεί ότι η καθυστέρηση οφειλόταν στην άρνηση της Nicki Minaj να τον αφήσει να παρουσιάσει μια παλιά συνεργασία τους.

Τα λόγια του προκάλεσαν την οργή του Τζο Μπάιντεν και της Anti-Defamation League, αναφερόμενοι σε αυτόν ως «φαύλο αντισημίτη» που «έθεσε τους Εβραίους σε κίνδυνο». «Δεν ήταν πρόθεσή μου να πληγώσω ή να εξευτελίσω και λυπάμαι βαθιά για κάθε πόνο που μπορεί να προκάλεσα», έγραψε ο West στα εβραϊκά στο Instagram.

"Drake's best diss tracks, ranked","Drake has been involved in his share of rap beefs over the years. Most recently, he fired shots at Kendrick Lamar on the April 19 diss track ""Push Ups,"" and Lamar responded with his lengthy retort "" Euphoria "" on April 30, dragging Drake's parenting skills, his Canadianness and more. The pair's on-again, off-again feud was first reignited in March, when Lamar declared himself the best rapper and dissed Drake and J. Cole in a verse on the track ""Like That.""
However, Lamar is only one of Drake's musical foes, as Drake has also feuded with Kanye West, Pusha T and more. Luckily for hip-hop fans, these disputes have resulted in many scorching diss tracks, with Drake spitting lyrics that range from comical to cutting.
While Drake has also dissed his enemies on collaborations (such as "" Circo Loco "" with 21 Savage) and as a featured artist (his verse on "" Stay Schemin '""), we've ranked his best solo diss tracks below.
18. 'Fear of Heights' (2023)
Drake and Rihanna were on and off for years, and even though she's moved on with A$AP Rocky, Drake couldn't resist mentioning their expired romance on ""Fear of Heights."" The Toronto rapper spends a few bars declaring he's over his ex (""Why they make it sound like I'm still hung up on you?""), but the song falls short when he raps about how boring her new man is and how much better his new love interests are, proving he's stuck in the past.
17. 'Taylor Made Freestyle' (2024)
On April 19, Drake released two diss tracks aimed at Kendrick Lamar: ""Push Ups"" and ""Taylor Made Freestyle."" He forays into AI with the latter, using the voices of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg to bait Lamar into responding: ""Now's a time to really make a power move/ 'cause right now it's looking like you writing out the game plan on how to lose,"" he raps as an ersatz Snoop. Since Drake doesn't rap in his own voice until the last verse — and didn't release the song on streaming platforms — it seems the track is meant to provoke a reaction rather than showcase any lyrical prowess.
16. 'Middle of the Ocean,' (2022)
""Middle of the Ocean"" contains a gorgeous sample of ""Cry Together"" by the O'Jays, making it one of Her Loss's more distinct tracks. While the beginning of the song is tame, Drake takes a moment to call Alexis Ohanian, the husband of his rumoured ex, Serena Williams, a groupie: ""Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie/ he claim we don't got a problem but/ no, boo, it is like you comin' for sushi."" Unfortunately for Drake, it's a diss that doesn't quite land because it's a label Ohanian is proud of: ""The reason I stay winning is because I'm relentless about being the absolute best at whatever I do — including being the best groupie for my wife and daughter,"" Ohanian tweeted following the song's release.
15. 'Virginia Beach' (2023)
Drake mourned his relationship with Rihanna on another For All the Dogs track with the haunting ""Virginia Beach"": ""Drawin' conclusions like you got a Parsons degree or something/ I coulda treated you better, that's crazy."" Calling out his ex while insisting he treated her well isn't Drake at his most cunning or memorable. Hearing him reflect on their failed relationship over a melancholy sample of Frank Ocean's ""Wise Man"" makes him seem sad more than anything else.
14. 'Red Button' (2023)
Kanye West and Drake have had their ups and downs , going from friends and collaborators to adversaries — and now they're embroiled in another feud . On ""Red Button,"" Drake addresses their turbulent relationship: ""Every time that Yeezy called a truce, he had my head inflated,"" he rapped, later adding that ""this is not a graduation,"" referring to West's third studio album. Drake favours taking subliminal shots at his enemies on most of his songs, so calling West out explicitly makes ""Red Button"" one of the louder disses in his catalogue.
13. 'Do Not Disturb' (2017)
On this lengthy track, Drake reflected on fame, money, fake friends and more, while also getting a few jabs in at Tory Lanez, whose first name is Daystar: ""You overnight celebrity, you one day star,"" he rapped. The diss is a footnote rather than the song's focus, but it's a clever lyric nonetheless.
12. 'Stories About My Brother' (2023)
Drake hasn't liked rapper-turned-podcaster Joe Budden since 2016, when he called Drake's album Views "" uninspired ."" The two have gone back and forth on social media since then, and on ""Stories About My Brother,"" Drake revealed he doesn't care for Budden's criticism: ""Imagine us gettin' our validation from an ex-musician searchin' for recognition,"" he rapped. Although the production from Conductor Williams and Jimmy Q on the track is top-notch, ""Stories About My Brother"" is not one of Drake's most resonant disses.
11. '7am on Bridle Path' (2021)
On this Certified Lover Boy track, Drake pulled no punches and continued his feud with Kanye West. Drake joked about West's followers, fashion design career (""I could give a f--k about who designing your sneakers and tees""), failed presidential campaign and more. Even though the song doesn't have a catchy hook, it sounds like a lyrical stream of consciousness that showcases a version of Drake who is hungry for vengeance and dominance.
10. 'Two Birds, One Stone' (2016)
Kid Cudi, Pusha T and Meek Mill were not spared on ""Two Birds, One Stone,"" a moody track that spotlights sharp, diaristic lyricism. While Drake spends a chunk of the song stating that he doesn't believe the extent of Pusha's drug-dealing past, it was Cudi who received the harshest words, with Drake bringing up Cudi's struggles with mental health : ""You were the Man on the Moon/ now you just go through your phases."" Cudi, who was in rehab the month of the song's release, responded furiously on X, formerly known as Twitter, and many Drake fans called out the diss on social media for crossing a line . It's one of Drake's darker disses, but in the years following the song's release Cudi and Drake have mended their relationship.
9. 'Push Ups' (2024)
After weeks of addressing his ongoing beef with Kendrick Lamar, Future and Metro Boomin through Instagram stories and memes, Drake finally released ""Push Ups,"" an amusing diss that hits back at the three artists. Although he primarily targets Lamar, he also takes shots at the Weeknd and Rick Ross, the latter of whom recently dropped his Drake diss "" Champagne Moments ."" Most of the lyrics chide Lamar for being a ""pipsqueak"" — ""How the f--k you big steppin' with a size 7 men's on?"" — while also poking fun at his pop collaborations: "" Maroon 5 need a verse , you better make it witty."" Drake's humour shines through in spades, which makes it entertaining and, more importantly, memorable. Even though the beat is a tad lacklustre, the song is effective for its comical lyrics and Drake's sassy delivery.
8. 'Draft Day' (2014)
On the surface, ""Draft Day"" celebrates Drake's wins and shouts out his friend and former NFL player Johnny Manziel. A slowed and looped sample of Lauryn Hill's ""Doo Wop (That Thing)"" makes it an infectious track that has all the markings of a classic early Drake song: he tells listeners to watch out for him, gloats about making hits and shoots his shot with a woman — in this case, it's Jennifer Lawrence. But it's the digs at Jay Z and Chance the Rapper that make the song stick. He responds to Jay Z's diss on "" We Made It (Freestyle) "" with an amusing bar: ""Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk,"" and near the end of the track he snappily slights Chance the Rapper: ""And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper/ yeah, no offence 'cause I don't know that n---a."" A decade later, both insults remain humorous.
7. 'Charged Up' (2015)
""Charged Up"" was Drake's first response to Meek Mill when the two beefed in 2015 , after Mill alleged Drake used a ghostwriter on their collaboration ""R.I.C.O."" Over slow instrumentals, Drake explains that his appearance on the song was no more than him doing charity work, while also taunting Mill about his lack of money from being signed to Maybach Music Group: ""Come live all your dreams out at OVO/ we gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes."" It was a warning of what was to come in their feud, and demonstrated Drake's knack for pointed lyricism and thirst for victory.
6. '4PM in Calabasas' (2016)
There are a few speculated targets in ""4PM in Calabasas,"" however it's Sean (Diddy) Combs who gets the most smoke. Drake raps, ""Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile/ take that, take that"" and ""Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays,"" referencing Combs's hook on "" Can't Nobody Hold Me Down ."" The catchy instrumentals are reminiscent of early Drake songs and that, coupled with his energized and confident delivery, makes it a noteworthy diss.
5. '6 PM in New York' (2015)
One of Drake's most underrated songs, ""6 PM in New York"" is often remembered for its sincerity due to these lyrics: ""Some nights I wish I could go back in life/ not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice."" However, after Tyga called Drake ""fake"" in an interview with Vibe magazine , Drake dragged him on the song and stated he ""should've kept it inside."" ""Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage/ you need to act your age and not your girl's age,"" he rapped, calling out Tyga's eight-year age gap with his then-girlfriend, Kylie Jenner. It's a straightforward diss, which makes it effective, and reminds listeners that Drake excels at storytelling when he wants to.
4. 'Summer Sixteen' (2016)
Drake made it clear he was ""looking for revenge"" when referencing how he played his diss track ""Back to Back"" on repeat while his then-foe, Meek Mill, was staying at the same hotel : ""I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, n---a/ we must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed."" It's a hilarious choice to reference the real-life incident, especially after winning his feud with Mill the year prior. After a beat switch, Drake changes up his flow but keeps the heat on high, focusing his attention on fellow Toronto rapper Tory Lanez while bragging, ""All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little."" While not as cutting as some of his other disses, ""Summer Sixteen"" is Drake in his villain era, challenging his enemies with a smirk.
3. '5AM in Toronto' (2013)
For years, Drake fans have speculated that ""5AM in Toronto"" took implicit shots at the Weeknd, after the pop star decided against signing to Drake's OVO label. ""A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf/ I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help,"" he raps, hinting that the Weeknd's full-length 2013 debut, Kiss Land, would have been more successful under Drake. ""5AM in Toronto"" gets points for being a passionately, fiercely articulated diss, although it would have been even more delicious had the Weeknd not gone on to find superstardom . There's still bad blood between the two Toronto musicians, as the Weeknd recently dissed Drake on the 2024 track "" All to Myself ,"" singing, ""I thank God that I never signed my life away.""
2. 'Duppy Freestyle' (2018)
""I'm in shock/ the nerve, the audacity,"" Drake begins on ""Duppy Freestyle,"" his dramatic attempt to fend off allegations of using ghostwriters once again, this time courtesy of Pusha T . Drake released the song only hours after Pusha's song "" Infared "" dropped, as a musical retort to Pusha and his producer, Kanye West. Drake's quick response time, impassioned delivery and an earwormy sample of Tata Vega's ""Ever So Lovingly"" earned him some points in the beef, and he topped it off by sending an invoice to Pusha and West's then-label for ""promotional assistance and career reviving."" However, mentioning Pusha's then-fiancée — ""I told you keep playin' with my name/ and I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams"" — ultimately backfired when Pusha responded with "" The Story of Adidon ,"" which was merciless for revealing Drake had a secret son. Still, ""Duppy Freestyle"" was a momentous diss at the time, despite Pusha winning the beef later.

"Julia Fox 'Cringes' Over Her Embarrassing Past Relationships, Including Ex Kanye West","Julia Fox is looking back but not with fond memories. The Italian-American actress recalls her past relationships, including controversial rapper Kanye West, and cringed at all the men she's ever dated. Cosmopolitan shared a video on Monday, April 29 where Fox went down memory lane commenting on some of the biggest 'red flag' incidents.
Image Source: Getty Images | Photo by Jerod Harris
When asked which of her exes is the 'most cringe', the 34-year-old immediately replied, ""All of them, guys...They're all really embarrassing. From my baby daddy…to the other one."" Fox also acknowledged her one-month relationship with the Praise God rapper in February 2022. However, she mentioned one specific man from her past whom she deemed as the most cringe-worthy ex, ""My drug-dealer boyfriend that kidnapped me when I was in high school and didn't let me leave his house. Cringe!""
The Uncut Gems star also delved into her high-profile relationship with West, who's currently married to his former Yeezy architect, Bianca Censori. In her memoir Down the Drain, Fox didn't mention the rapper's name but shared some 'red flags' she initially ignored because the romance was still new. But later, in a candid interview with ABC's daytime talk show The View, in October 2023, the PVT Chat star addressed the same with the all-women panelists. Sunny Hostin quizzed Fox about her notorious relationship with the unnamed 'artist' in her book, speculated to be West.
The lawyer read out the red flags Fox wrote in her book, ""You say it wasn't sexual at all, he offered you a boob job, supervised your wardrobe...he had his assistants pick up all your stuff take them out and bring the new stuff, promised not to embarrass you, and when he asked you to be his girlfriend, you just laughed at him."" Fox explained, ""I just didn't believe it. I met him the day before. I asked him if we could just wait and see how this goes before making an announcement. I needed to mentally prepare for something like that. But then I saw that the next day it had been mysteriously leaked to the press.""

Additionally, in a recent interview with InStyle, in April, the actress said that her month-long fling with West left a ""sour taste in her mouth."" She also elaborated on how dating men from 'this sphere' can cause an identity crisis for women who are constantly overshadowed by their boyfriends. ""I don't ever want to just be known as someone's girlfriend...I know I'm so much more than that. And I feel like that happens so much to women in this industry. They're only as good as their partner or they can make a whole career off being some guy's partner."" She concluded, ""I want to break that mold, and I want to just stand on my own two feet and not need a man to back me. I did that for years. I'm good. I have established myself, and I want to keep establishing myself. And maybe one day I'll even be taken seriously.""",2024-05-01T04:31:00Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's 'Talking' Video: Watch,"If Ye is to be believed, Vultures 2, the follow-up to the Billboard 200-topping album Vultures 1, is set to drop on Friday, May 3. But in the event the album does not pop up on streamers at the end of this week, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and Ty have delivered a video for Vultures 1‘s third single, “Talking,” to keep fans satiated.
Hewing closely to the muted black and grey tones developed for the group’s overall aesthetic, the video looks like the other visuals the duo have delivered so far with one big (or small) exception: North West plays a starring role. Not only does Ye’s eldest daughter make a show-stealing appearance, she’s credited as the video’s writer and director. Aus Taylor, who has worked with Ye in the past and photographed the album covers for Vultures 1 & 2, is credited as co-director.
Trending on Billboard
The video follows North as she performs her fan-favorite verse in various locations: A basketball court, a boxing ring, in a field standing next to a vulture (because, of course), hanging out of the roof of a drop top sports car, and at dinning table with friends. Then, the beat changes and Ty takes over, singing the latter part of the song which has been dubbed “Once Again.” The video fades out with Ye standing on a mountaintop as the clouds roll in and a vulture flies over him.
Released on February 10 after multiple delays, Vultures 1 managed to top the Billboard 200 despite controversy surrounding its distribution. On February 15, FUGA, the company that originally distributed the album, released a statement saying it was working on having the album removed from streaming services because its release violated its terms of service. The album was eventually re-released via Label Engine and birthed the No. 1 Hot 100 single “Carnival” featuring Rich the Kidd and Playboi Carti.

Kim Kardashian is adding a little more color into her life.
Just days after debuting a new, icy blond haircolor, the Skims founder, 43, decided to switch things up yet again, this time showing off a choppy, light pink bob on Instagram.
In a series of photos that were simply captioned with a pink heart emoji, a makeup-free Kardashian could be seen playing with her new super-short ‘do.
Her hair looked slightly wet and slicked back as she stared at the camera with a serious expression and the bright color popped against “The Kardashians” star’s all-black outfit, which included a long-sleeved turtleneck, tiny shorts and bulky thigh-high boots.
8 Aside from being pink, the star’s hair was styled in a wet, cropped cut, which she played with for the photos. Kim Kardashian/Instagram

Shortly after sharing, friends and family members rushed to the comments to share their excitement for the new look.
“Hot ❤️‍🔥,” commented hairstylist and pal Chris Appleton, while Khloé Kardashian simply wrote “Looooooove.”
Still, there were a few fans who thought Kardashian’s hair change felt a tad familiar, and wondered if the “American Horror Story: Delicate” actress was inspired by her ex Kanye West’s wife, Bianca Censori, who often rocks a cropped, wet-looking cut.
8 The pink style comes one day after Kardashian debuted an icy blond haircolor.

“This is definitely a Censori look…” one person wrote, as another pointed out that the look was “straight outta Censori’s playbook 🙃.”
“Yeezy taught them, all the same things,” a popular comment read, giving the rapper and designer all the credit.
A few additional comments also referenced the Taylor Swift’s song “thanK you aIMee,” which is reportedly about Kardashian.
“aIMee is trying to look edgy,” someone noted.

For more Page Six Style …
Of course, this major change comes less than a week before the Met Gala on May 6, which Kardashian is reportedly attending once again.
It’s possible that her new hairstyle goes along a dramatic outfit and is her way of interpreting the night’s theme, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” or the dress code, “Garden of Time.”
In years past, Kardashian’s Met Gala looks have been nothing short of statement-making. While she draped herself in pearls last year, showing up in a Schiaparelli Haute Couture creation, she famously faced backlash in 2022, when she pulled one of Marilyn Monroe’s most memorable gowns out of the archives for the event.",2024-04-30T16:01:02Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
Did Julia Fox Shade Kanye West With ‘Other One’ Comment?,"Fans think that Julia Fox may have been shading her ex-boyfriend Kanye “Ye” West in a new interview for Cosmopolitan’s “Cheap Shots” video series, released on Monday, April 29. During the video, the actress, 34, didn’t hold back in spilling details about her personal life, but when it came time to discuss her past romances, she seemingly took a shot at Ye, 46.
One of the questions was which of her exes was the “most cringe,” and while she didn’t name The Life of Pablo rapper, some fans believe that she was making a reference to him in her response. “All of them, guys. They’re all really embarrassing. From my baby daddy to the other one,” she said in the clip. While she didn’t say Ye outright, the mention was seemingly a reference to her short-lived romance with the rapper.
While she called of her exes “embarrassing,” Julia didn’t name Ye as her “most cringe,” and the answer is actually surprising. “Probably my drug dealer boyfriend that kidnapped me when I was in high school and didn’t let me leave his house,” she said. “Cringe!”
In another question, she was asked about three men that she would want to repel, and she named Andrew Tate, Donald Trump, and Tucker Carlson. In the comments, many fans absolutely loved what Julia said in her interview. “I approve of what Julia Fox had to say about those men,” one person wrote underneath the video.
Other than the speculation about her comment, Julia has opened up about the stigma about being Ye’s ex-girlfriend in a recent interview with InStyle. She admitted that she wasn’t happy about having people think of her as the rapper’s ex, rather than seeing her work stand on its own. “That’s why I have such a sour taste in my mouth about dating anyone in this sphere,” she said. “I don’t ever want to just be known as someone’s girlfriend. I know I’m so much more than that. And I feel like that happens so much to women in this industry. They’re only as good as their partner or they can make a whole career off being some guy’s partner. But regardless, either way, it becomes their identity.”",2024-04-30T15:51:55Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
Chris Brown Tells Funny Story That Some Fans Think Is About Kanye West,"Chris Brown is quite the hilarious and engaging storyteller, as he recently proved on his R&B Money podcast appearance. For a segment about offering a funny anecdote without naming any names, he spoke on an artist who went clubbing with him one night with a lot of women to see another artist perform. Eventually, the former unnamed celebrity took the stage and went on a 45-minute rant, which Breezy says completely killed his vibe and turned the venue into ""the waiting room in hell."" There was even an clap-back from the artist about Amber Rose and fingers in their... you know. As such, a lot of people think that the R&B star was talking about his ""BEG FORGIVENESS"" collaborator, Kanye West.
Furthermore, the clip below shows some footage of the club night that Chris Brown is allegedly referring to, specifically the Amber Rose part of the rant. However, perhaps we'll never really know for sure whether Kanye West was really the subject of his story, although it seems way too coincidental to interpret it any other way. Regardless, either the Virginia native just has really bad luck with going to the club with Rose's exes or he forgot that there was readily available footage of this online. It's also ironic because Ye praised Chris during his latest interview on Justin LaBoy's The Download podcast.

Chris Brown Allegedly Tells Funny Kanye West Story, Fans Theorize
""Chris is a god,"" Kanye West said of Chris Brown, arguing that great artists like him are marred by ""middle men"" and find it harder to find massive success. Still, this is all a bit bizarre considering that the two artists have been at odds with each other in the past, such as the debacle about removing Brown from Donda post-release. It seems like right now, it's all water under the bridge, considering their VULTURES 1 collaboration. But who knows if Ye catches wind of this interview clip and feels some type of way about it?
Meanwhile, the ""Run It"" multi-hyphenate is supposedly still involved in his Quavo beef, as fans accused him of buying a huge chunk of his latest show's tickets so that very few people would show up. He hasn't spoken on it at press time, though, so it's just a fan theory. But if Chris Brown ever does, we're sure that it would be quite the amusing story from his perspective. Maybe he'll have to do so without mentioning the former Migo's name, just like this alleged Kanye West tale.

"J Cole Links Up With ""Female Kanye"" Akbar V Amidst Kanye West Feud","J Cole has had a rough couple months. He went from being one of the most highly-rated emcees in the game, one of the self-proclaimed ""Big Three,"" to becoming a punchline for many. Cole's decision to take back his Kendrick Lamar diss led to other rappers dismissing him, including Kanye West. The ""Carnival"" hitmaker even dissed Cole on the ""Like That"" remix. Still, Cole is keeping a cool head. The rapper posed for a photo with Kanye's so-called female counterpart, Akbar V.
Akbar V is best known for her stint on Love & Hip-Hop: Atlanta. Her boisterous personality and penchant for branding made her an instant standout among the cast. She dubbed herself the ""Queen of Atlanta,"" and in one memorable tweet, she decided that she should be recognized as the ""female"" Kanye West. ""I'm the female Kanye West,"" she asserted in 2022. ""So if anybody was wondering why I speak my mind... ask him why he speak his."" In addition to her reality star status, however, Akbar V is also an aspiring rap star.

She's dropped four albums since arriving on the scene in 2017. She also feels that she's underrated when it comes to her rhyming skills. ""Why am I left out of these rap conversations when i [rap] circles around a lot of male's and female's?"" she tweeted in 2023. ""Please don't say drama cause a lot of these rap girls be in drama. and I ain't even been in drama lately I been in studio and taking care my Fam.""
J. Cole's expression in the photo led to several jokes in the comment section, with many claiming that he looked scared. ""Cole, blink twice if you need assistance,"" one user wrote. Another theorized that J. Cole was just being nice by agreeing to the photo. ""He’s looking like 'Let me just take this picture, so she can get out of my face,'"" they added.
J. Cole has seen brighter days, but things may be turning around. The rapper has already begun to drum up buzz for his upcoming album, The Fall Off. The highly anticipated sequel to Cole's The Come Up, The Fall Off has earned praise from those close to him. Daylyt, who had a guest verse on Might Delete Later, tweeted that Cole's rapping is next level on the album. ""It’s one of the best levels of rapping I have ever witnessed,"" he wrote. ""Cole is going out with a nuclear missile.""

Kanye West enthüllt: Mit ihr hätte er gerne einen Dreier!,"Kanye West (46) kann es scheinbar nicht lassen! Erst vor wenigen Tagen machte der Rapper Negativschlagzeilen, weil er angeblich einen anderen Mann vermöbelt haben soll und war damit in aller Munde. Grund dafür: Kanyes Opfer soll seine Frau Bianca Censori (29) belästigt haben. Jetzt sorgt der Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian (43) erneut für Aufsehen. Im Podcast ""The Download"" sprach der 46-Jährige offen über seine sexuellen Vorstellungen. Auf die Frage, mit wem er und seine Frau gerne mal einen Dreier haben wollen würden, antwortet er: ""Michelle Obama"". ""Du musst die Frau des Präsidenten bumsen"", fügt Kanye hinzu. Ob das ein Seitenhieb gegen die einstige First Lady und ihre Familie sein soll?
Schon in der Vergangenheit sind Barack (62) und Michelle Obama (60) mit Kim Kardashian und ihrem Ex aneinandergeraten. Beispielweise als Kanye Taylor Swifts (34) Dankesrede 2009 bei den MTV Video Music Awards unterbrach, weil er der Meinung war, Beyoncé (42) hätte den Preis für das beste Video mehr verdient. Obama kritisierte das Verhalten des Rappers damals scharf und kommentierte seinen Auftritt gegenüber CNBC mit den Worten: ""Er ist talentiert, aber ein Idiot!"" Vier Jahre später sorgte der ""Stronger""-Interpret erneut für Aufruhr, als er behauptete, seine damalige Verlobte sei einflussreicher als Michelle.
Wie Kanyes neue Frau Bianca wohl zu dem skandalösen Verhalten ihres Mannes steht? Ein Insider verriet in der australischen Radioshow ""Ben, Liam & Belle"", dass das Paar die Negativschlagzeilen scheinbar nicht an ihre Liebe heranlässt: ""Aber alles, was ich weiß, ist, dass sie verliebt und glücklich sind."" Biancas Vater soll allerdings nicht so überzeugt von seinem Schwiegersohn sein, denn er befürchte, dass Kanye seine neue Frau von ihrer Familie isolieren möchte. ""Ihr Vater hat vor, ein ernstes Wort mit Kanye zu reden. Leo wird sich nicht von Kanyes Erfolg einschüchtern lassen und ihm die Stirn bieten"", erklärte ein weiterer Insider gegenüber Daily Mail.

When Fans Were ‘Terrified’ as Kanye West’s Wife Bianca Censori Fled America to Her Family in Australia,"Bianca Censori traveled away from her husband Kanye West and the United States to visit Australia, and fans are hoping for a change in her perspective.
Earlier this month, the 28-year-old made her way back to Australia to visit some of her closest pals. The recent vacation to Australia, according to DailyMail, has given Censori ""an outside perspective."" A source close to her revealed to the outlet, ""Everyone is just glad that they finally were able to get through to Bianca. Her friends let her know exactly how they felt and they told her that she needs to wake the f**k up.""

The source explained, per The Sun, ""She knows that she has shut out those close to her and she is also starting to see through the smoky mirrors of her marriage. She is aware of West's controlling ways and she is starting to see things from an outside perspective.""
A few insiders previously revealed the rigorous rules that Bianca was allegedly adhering to, confirming the growing concerns about West's apparent control over the architect. According to an insider who spoke to Daily Mail in October, West was radicalizing his wife to become more like his 43-year-old ex Kim Kardashian. According to the insider, Censori, who has been employed by the musician since 2020, no longer has an independent thought process and simply obeys West.
The source had revealed at the time, per LBC, ""Kanye has a set of rules for Bianca, which includes never speaking and wearing what he wants her to wear. She is also required to eat certain food items and to work out even though Kanye doesn’t work out. She has no mind of her own anymore and obeys him because he has convinced her that they are royal.""
The nearly see-through catsuit that Bianca was spotted sporting over the summer was designed by Kanye's covert design team in Italy, which she was allegedly not fully sure she wanted to wear, per Mirror.

Following her recent vacation to Australia, fans of Bianca on a Reddit Kardashian group discussed her prospective separation from the rapper. A fan expressed concern over the alleged control and shared, ""Well.. she's not being groomed per se but she is being abused and in an awful relationship/power dynamic. good to see her separate.""
Another fan added that they feel concerned every time they see her. ""Every time I see a photo of her I think she looks like she's being abused. Hope she keeps away from him,"" the fan wrote. Another felt happy that she was trying to break away, saying, ""I’m so happy to hear this. their relationship freaked me out. I’m glad that she’s free from him. there’s no doubt in my mind that man is not well."" A fan expressed hope that she's getting support. ""I hope she is getting the support she needs,"" they said.

Kanye West will mit „Yeezy Porn“ in Pornoindustrie einsteigen,"Der umstrittene Rapper Ye, besser bekannt als Kanye West, hat in seinen sozialen Kanälen angekündigt, in die Pornoindustrie einsteigen zu wollen. In einem mittlerweile gelöschten Post veröffentlichte der Musiker ein sechs Sekunden langes Video mit dem Satz „Yeezy Porn Is Cumming“ („Yeezy Porno kommt“) und forderte seine Follower auf, die Seite yeezy.com zu besuchen. Dort ist allerdings noch nichts von den Porno-Plänen zu sehen.
Laut der amerikanischen Unterhaltungsseite tmz will Ye dafür mit Stormy Daniels Ex-Ehemann Mike Moz, ein Veteran in der Erwachsenenfilm-Industrie, zusammenarbeiten. „Ich habe mit Ye Gespräche über eine mögliche Zusammenarbeit zwischen der Marke Yeezy und meinem Team bei der Vixen Media Group geführt. Obwohl es noch zu früh ist, um Einzelheiten zu nennen, bin ich gespannt, wohin Ye mit seiner Vision führt“, sagte Moz.

Er fügte hinzu: „Die Vorstellung, dass dieses Projekt ein weiteres Pornostudio sein wird, ist nicht richtig. Es wird wie nichts sein, was wir jemals zuvor gesehen haben.“ Zuvor gab es Berichte, dass Ye den Aufbau eines Pornostudios plane.
Nach der Ankündigung auf X (vormals Twitter) erhielt der Rapper heftige Kritik von seinen Fans, die ihn dazu ermahnten „zu Christus zurückzukehren“. Der bekennende Christ trat regelmäßig mit dem Sunday Service Chor auf und veröffentlichte 2019 das Album „Jesus is King“. Mittlerweile ist das Konto von Ye auf der Plattform deaktiviert, es ist unklar, ob er das Konto selbst gelöscht oder die Plattform ihn gesperrt hat.
Der Rapper, der durch antisemitische Ausbrüche aufgefallen war und seinen lukrativen Adidas-Deal deshalb verloren hat, gestand 2022 an einer Pornosucht zu leiden. „Hollywood ist ein großes Bordell. Pornografie hat meine Familie zerstört. Ich habe mit einer Sucht zu tun, die Instagram unterstützt. Ich werde nicht zulassen, dass es Northy und Chicago auch betrifft“, sagte der 46-Jährige. Auch ein verbales Fasten legte er sich in diesem Jahr auf, wo er einen Monat lang, keinen Alkohol, keine Erotikfilme und keinen Geschlechtsverkehr haben wollte.",2024-04-29T13:24:47Z,https://www.berliner-zeitung.de,Berliner Zeitung
Kanye West Battery Investigation Gets Key Update,"Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori found themselves in a bizarre situation a few weeks back. Overall, it all started with a TMZ report that Ye had punched a man in the face in Los Angeles. This subsequently sparked an investigation into the legendary artist. However, it was then stated that one of the men sexually assaulted Censori, which is what sparked Ye's violent outburst. Of course, this shifted the public perception of the incident, and fans were largely on Ye's side.
Since the incident, new details have surfaced, with the Twins at the center of this being identified as the Houston twins. Furthermore, witnesses claim that they never actually saw the Houston twins interact with Censori in a sexual way. This has led to a bit of confusion as to what truly went down here. What's more, TMZ is now reporting that both sides have become uncooperative. The Houston twins won't speak with the LAPD, and neither will Kanye. This has led to some speculation that the two parties are having conversations with one another as a means to resolve this.

If things continue as is, the investigation will eventually die out, and this will simply become another footnote in Ye's turbulent career. Only time will tell whether or not the Houston twins have a change of heart. Hopefully, all sides are doing okay following whatever went down.

Nach Schlägerei: Kanye Wests Verfahren wird wohl eingestellt,"Kanye West (46) ist einem Gerichtsprozess wohl doch noch entgangen. Der Rapper begann während einer Veranstaltung im Chateau Marmont eine Schlägerei und schlug einem der The-Houston-Brothers-Zwillinge ins Gesicht. Nachdem das LAPD die Auseinandersetzung beendet hatte, wurde der Rapper wegen Körperverletzung angeklagt. Wie TMZ berichtet, soll das Verfahren nun eingestellt werden, da sich niemand zu dem Vorfall äußert. Die Polizei versuchte, die Sänger Jonnie und Mark zu erreichen – dennoch vermuten die Beamten, dass Kanye in der Zwischenzeit Kontakt mit ihnen aufgenommen haben könnte, um die Angelegenheit aus der Öffentlichkeit herauszuhalten.
Einer der beiden Zwillinge soll laut Kanyes Aussage Bianca Censori (29) unangemessen berührt haben. In dem Podcast ""The Download"" schilderte er, dass der mutmaßliche Täter mit ihr zusammengestoßen sei und unter ihr Kleid gegriffen habe. ""Ich sprach mit dem Mann und sagte: 'Sie müssen jetzt sofort gehen', und er meinte: 'Oh, es ist okay.' Und ich sagte: 'Nein, es ist nicht okay'"", erinnert er sich. Wie Insidern gegenüber dem Newsportal geäußert haben, sollen Aufnahmen der Überwachungskameras zeigen, dass es sich hierbei nur um einen leichten Zusammenstoß gehandelt habe. Dennoch eskalierte die Situation und Kanye schlug den Zwilling nieder.
Seit dem Vorfall wurden Bianca und Kanye wieder gemeinsam gesichtet. Eine Expertin für Körpersprache analysierte die Paparazzi-Fotos und sprach von einer ""unklaren Körpersprache von Bianca und Kanye"". Obwohl das Paar nach wie vor passende Outfits trägt und eine starke Einheit bildet, könnte die Schlägerei wohl dicke Luft verursacht haben. ""Bianca geht vor, anstatt neben oder hinter Kanye, und es gibt weniger verbindende Gesten als sonst, wie beispielsweise das Händchenhalten"", erklärte die Expertin.

Kanye West saksøkt av tidligere sikkerhetsvakt,"Benjamin Deshon Provo påstår at han har blitt utsatt for feilaktig oppsigelse, skriver People. Han har nå saksøkt Kanye West – eller YeKanye West byttet navn til Ye i 2021. – og søker erstatning.
Ifølge klagen begynte West i april 2023 «urettmessig og urimelig å kreve at saksøker og andre måtte barbere hodet», til tross for at Provo hadde håret i dreadlocks «som en utøvelse av sin muslimske tro».
Provo jobbet med sikkerhet på privatskolen Donda Academy og på et lager der West oppbevarte Yeezy-klær. Han anklager West for å ha «hyppig skreket på og skjelt ut svarte ansatte».
En representant for West har ikke svart på Peoples forespørsel om kommentar.
Provo hevder også at han ble bedt om å utsette seg selv og paparazziene «i fare» ved å ta kameraer, og at West krevde at «alle tilknyttet Donda kastet bøker relatert til Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X og andre fremtredende skikkelser i det svarte samfunnet».
Han begynte å jobbe for West rundt august 2021.",2024-04-28T09:36:45Z,https://www.vg.no,VG
Kanye West sued for racial discrimination by former security guard,"Kanye West is being sued for racial discrimination by a former security guard.
The 46-year-old rapper is the subject of a lawsuit filed by Benjamin Deshon Provo — who worked for the All Day hitmaker at both his Donda Academy school and at a warehouse used as storage for Yeezy clothing — in which the former employee alleged the controversial star subjected Black employees to “less favourable treatment than their White counterparts.”
Documents obtained by People magazine alleged Kanye “frequently screamed at and berated Black employees” and fired Benjamin for refusing to cut his dreadlocks.
The security guard told how he began working for Kanye around August 2021 and after six months at Donda Academy, when the school moved locations he was “assigned additional job duties as a result of a lack of staffing, which included the Vultures rapper’s Sunday Service events and at his Yeezy warehouse. During that time, he alleged he was asked to place himself and paparazzi “in harm’s way” by snatching cameras from waiting photographers.

Additionally, Benjamin claimed Kanye made “anyone associated with Donda dispose of books related to Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and other prominent figures in the Black community” and alleged he was paid less than non-Black employees “for no discernible reason”.
The lawsuit accused Kanye of displaying a “stark difference” in the way he treated Black employees to other staff members and claimed he was “always abrupt, abrasive, and demeaning of Plaintiff and his Black counterparts.”
When the man complained about the pay disparity to his line manager John Hicks, he was told not to raise the topic with Kanye and shortly afterwards saw a “decrease in his paycheques”, which his white colleagues didn’t experience, and was told the rapper “can’t afford security right now”.
In April 2023, the Bound 2 hitmaker allegedly “unjustifiably and unreasonably began demanding that Plaintiff and others shave their heads,” despite Benjamin wearing his hair in dreadlocks “as an exercise of his Muslim faith.”
The document added: “As a result of Plaintiff’s non-compliance with Kanye’s demands that his head be shaved, Hicks and Kanye began to exert pressure on Plaintiff to do the same.
“Kanye began to become increasingly more aggressive, demanding (and declared) ‘It is time for you to shave your heads. I am not messing around.’
“However, Plaintiff refused. Thereafter, Hicks approached Plaintiff and stated, ‘Kanye said, ‘Tell the one with the dreads to shave his head or he is fired.’ Plaintiff refused to shave his head, and as a result thereof, his employment was terminated.”
The plaintiff is seeking damages for the alleged discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, labour code violations and for attorney fees, as well as a “preliminary and permanent injunction, and a public injunction, against all Defendants, prohibiting them from owning and operating any type of educational school for minor children under the age of 18 years in the state of California.”",2024-04-28T08:02:44Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow

“I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book’s autograph. I am a proud nonreader of books.” — via Reuters, 2009. Kanye's disdain for books may seem perplexing, but it's undeniably amusing in its eccentricity. His unconventional wisdom extends even to his reading habits, adding a humorous twist to his persona. While some may question his aversion to traditional sources of knowledge, others see it as a comedic quirk that sets him apart from the crowd. So the next time you're faced with a stack of books, just remember Kanye's disdain and have a good laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all.

So the next time you're feeling charitable, just remember Kanye's tree analogy and have a good laugh at the sheer audacity of it all.
9. Hip-Hop God

“I’m the closest that hip-hop is getting to God. In some situations, I’m like a ghetto Pope.” — via Late Registration playback, 2005.

Julia Fox will nicht nur als Ex von Kanye West bekannt sein,"Julia Fox (34) hat es satt, auf ihre Beziehungen reduziert zu werden! Vor knapp zwei Jahren hatte das Model mit Kanye West (46) angebandelt. Obwohl die Romanze der beiden nach bloß wenigen Wochen wieder im Sande verlief, sorgten die zwei für mächtige Schlagzeilen. Für Julia habe die Aufmerksamkeit, die sie aufgrund der Beziehung mit dem Rapper erlangt hatte, aber einen ""sauren Beigeschmack hinterlassen"". Gegenüber InStyle stellt die Beauty klar: ""Ich möchte nicht als die Freundin von jemandem bekannt sein. Ich weiß, dass ich viel mehr wert bin."" Laut Julia sei das aber bei Frauen in der Branche allgegenwärtig.
""Sie sind nur so gut wie ihr Partner oder gestalten ihre gesamte Karriere damit, die Freundin von jemandem zu sein – es wird zu ihrer Identität"", führt die gebürtige Italienerin fort. Diesem Teufelskreis zu entkommen, nehme Julia nun in Angriff. ""Ich habe das Gefühl, dass ich das überwinden muss. Ich möchte dieses Muster durchbrechen und einfach auf meinen eigenen Füßen stehen"", erklärt sie weiter. Die Schauspielerin sei es leid und wolle keinen Mann für eine laufende Karriere brauchen, denn so sei es ihr seit Jahren ergangen.
Nach ihrer kurzweiligen Beziehung zu Kanye verlor Julia nicht gerade lobende Worte über diese Zeit und sprach auch über die Hintergründe der Trennung. Der Musiker habe ständig ihre Aufmerksamkeit haben wollen. ""Ich musste meinen Sohn Valentino wickeln, aber er wollte telefonieren. Also hab ich mir AirPods gekauft, damit ich beides gleichzeitig machen kann. Es war aber einfach zu viel und auf Dauer unerträglich"", erzählte sie in der ""The Drew Barrymore Show"". Für die 34-Jährige stehe immer ihr Sohn an erster Stelle und die Liebelei mit Kanye habe sich für sie angefühlt, als hätte sie noch ein zweites Kind gehabt.

"When Kanye West Stopped his Concert Midway, Yelled at a Kid in A Wheelchair: ""Stand Up""","Kanye West is one of the most controversial musical talents in the entertainment industry. Famously known for being Kim Kardashian’s ex-husband, West has often been in the limelight since his debut as a rapper. The American Boy singer has in the past been noted for his antisemitic comments as per Forbes which in turn resulted in major brands such as Adidas ending their endorsements with him as per Vulture. There are many moments in the past where West may have been possibly oblivious to certain situations given he doesn’t mince his words when it comes to stating an opinion. One such time was back in 2014 when the rapper reportedly yelled at a child who was in a wheelchair in the middle of his concert, stopping the event in its tracks.
Image Source: Getty Images | Photo by Chelsea Lauren
According to a 2014 article by The Daily Beast, West once halted a weekend concert because the crowd allegedly didn’t stand up while West was performing. At the Qantas Credit Union Arena located in Sydney, Australia, a concert that was supposed to be about rocking it out with some good old fashion rap followed by groovy beats, and a raging crowd, turned out to be quite an awkward turn of events. Amid all of this, West shouted out in disappointment, “I can’t do this song.” He continued to explain, “I can’t do this show until everybody stands up…”
At this juncture, he proceeded to highlight exceptions of people whom he claimed to excuse based on a set of conditions. “Unless you got a handicap pass and you get special parking and s***,” said the rapper. He adds while claiming to note that he was being rather observant of fans in the crowd and was especially paying attention to anyone he claimed to see wasn’t standing. “I'mma see you if you ain’t standing up, believe me, I’m very good at that.” While West might’ve proceeded to perform rapping away, out of the corner of his eye he spotted a few fans who were seated despite his request for people to stand.

Taking sharp notice of those two, he brought his concert to an abrupt halt understandably leaving concertgoers perplexed and irritated. West began to eagerly urge the two to stand up and refused to budge otherwise. Finally after a brief moment, one of the two seated fans showed West a prosthetic limb to signal that she indeed possessed the handicap pass. After he saw the said limb, he seemed to be at ease and said, “Okay, you fine.” But, he now seemed to demand an answer or perhaps an explanation from the other fan seated right next to the prior one.
As per sources, West was in the middle of performing his hit song The Good Life; he halted and said in exasperation, “This is the longest I’ve had to wait to do a song. It’s unbelievable.” However, what he remained completely oblivious to was the hint the crowd surrounding the seated fan was trying to give him. West who seemed slightly agitated went on to send his bodyguard at the time - Pascal Duvier to the crowd to inspect the situation. After Duvier confirmed that the fan was in a wheelchair, West said, “He is in a wheelchair? It’s fine.” The show did go on even though there were some bumps with West receiving some major backlash after.

"De serpientes, ""zorras"" y reputaciones: la larga enemistad entre Taylor Swift y Kim Kardashian","Si nos atenemos a la actualidad, la relación entre Taylor Swift y Kim Kardashian está en uno de los puntos más bajos de su vida. Con una única canción, que, por otro lado, tampoco es que sea especialmente sutil sobre a quién se refiere —solo hay que mirar las mayúsculas de su título, thanK you aIMee—, la cantante ha hecho que la influencer y empresaria pierda más de medio millón de seguidores en Instagram. Y sigue decreciendo.
Los y las swifties parecen haberse puesto por fin de acuerdo para tomar partido en una enemistad que, aunque específicamente entre ellas comienza en 2015, da el pistoletazo de salida en 2009 y por el tercer vértice de esta historia: Kanye West. Pero en el nuevo tema de Taylor no aparece el rapero, sino que carga específicamente contra la fundadora de la marca SKIMS.
Por ello, vamos a centrarnos en cómo ha evolucionado la relación entre la dos milmillonarias a lo largo de los años, un drama público en el que el emoticono de la serpiente —primero usado contra Swift; ahora contra Kimberly— o la palabra ""zorra"" han jugado un papel fundamental en sendas reputaciones.
2009-2012, marcados por Kanye West
Posiblemente, en lo que concierne a la vida de Taylor Swift, 2009 sea muy recordado por el momento en que Kanye West subió al escenario del los MTV Video Music Awards para interrumpir su discurso de agradecimiento. Sin embargo, hay que tener en cuenta que en aquella época Kim Kardashian no solo no había comenzado a salir con el rapero, sino que todavía no había siquiera iniciado su relación y posterior breve matrimonio con el jugador de baloncesto Kris Humprhies.
Al contrario, en una alfombra roja de aquel año le preguntaron a la empresaria y socialite cuál era la música que más sonaba en su iPod en esas fechas y, sin lugar a dudas, confesó que era la canción Love Story. ""¡Me encanta Taylor Swift! Soy la mayor fan de Taylor Swift"", dijo sin titubear, antes de añadir que había comenzado a seguirla en Twitter porque no quería perderse ninguno de sus pasos.
En noviembre de 2012, y casualmente en los MTV European Music Awards, Kim y Taylor, acompañadas de Rita Ora, posarían juntas por primera vez.
2015-2016, la ""zorra"" de 'Famous'
Repetirían dos veces más, ambas en 2015: en una compartieron un sonado abrazo y, en agosto, se sientan juntas en otra entrega de premios. Estos nuevos gestos se debían, sobre todo, a que Taylor y Kanye habían enterrado el hacha de guerra. Quizá, aseguraron, por mediación de Kim, dado que desde 2012 el músico salía con la empresaria y, desde 2014, estaban casados.
Pero llega abril de 2016. Kanye West publica su canción Famous y, en ella, dice la famosa frase ""Creo que Taylor y yo aún podríamos tener sexo, ¿por qué? / Porque yo hice famosa a esa zorra"". A partir de ahí habrá mil y un dimes y diretes sobre esos versos, pues Kim Kardashian dice en una entrevista que no hay problema alguno con ellos porque la cantante sabía, gracias a una llamada de su marido, cómo era la canción y que le había pedido permiso —y Taylor se lo había dado—.
Pero poco después Swift asegura que eso ""no es cierto"" y, aunque admite la llamada de Kanye, puntualiza que no le dio su aprobación. Kim, sin embargo, sube a su cuenta de Snapchat las capturas de pantalla de la conversación de su esposo y Taylor —en la que ella se muestra de acuerdo con el primer verso; no hay constancia alguno de que se le comunicase el segundo— utilizando multitud de emoticonos de serpientes.
2017-2020, las serpientes y la reputación
A pesar de que Taylor continúa argumentando que ella no había escuchado la canción completa, algo que le prometía Kanye en las capturas, al dar su visto bueno, la serpiente se convierte en el emoji que más se repite en cada nueva publicación en sus redes, tildándola siempre de mentirosa por los fans de Kanye y Kim. ¿Y qué hace la cantante? Reapropiarse de ello.
Swift saca su disco Reputation en un momento en el que no siente el amor ni del público —por culpa de su fama de falsa— ni de la industria, debido a la jugarreta que le hizo su agente y por la que acabaría regrabando todos sus álbumes. En el videoclip de Look What You Made Me Do [Mirad lo que me habéis hecho hacer, si se quiere traducir en plural], ella aparece rodeada de serpientes y diciendo, claramente, que la ""antigua"" Taylor había ""muerto"".
Sus fans parecieron responder y la cuestión se fue disolviendo con el paso del tiempo, e incluso Kim llegó a concretar en 2019 que estaba todo ""superado"" —según Taylor, sin embargo, todavía le debían una disculpa—. En 2020, eso sí, vuelve a salir a la luz la cuestión cuando se filtra la conversación completa. Y curiosamente, ambas se dan la razón a sí mismas, hablando de manipulación por parte de la otra persona y de la ilegalidad de quien grabó dicha llamada.
2021-2024, reconciliación y vuelta a empezar
Y el tema desaparece: Kim se divorcia, Taylor entra en otra ""era"" de su trayectoria musical y Kanye se autoinmola con sus comentarios racistas y antisemitas. La socialite y empresaria, de hecho, vuelve a escuchar música de Swift, asegura que siempre le ha gustado Taylor y tanto ella como su hija North utilizan sus canciones en sus respectivas cuentas de Instagram.
Es decir, que la historia estaba superada. Pero en diciembre de 2023, Taylor afirma que la llamada con Ye, ser una ""zorra"", las serpientes de Kim y la reacción del público fue, para ella, la ""muerte"" de su ""carrera"", que sintió ""arrastrada psicológicamente"" y que por culpa de aquello ya no puede ""confiar en nadie nunca más"".
Y, para certificar esta sensación, saca en su último disco thanK you aIMee, en la que describe a Kim Kardashian como una bully de instituto. Eso sí, Taylor promete venganza: algún día, uno de sus hijos, llegará a casa cantando esa misma canción y ella (Kim) será consciente de que ha perdido...",2024-04-27T06:21:03Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos
"Jimmy Kimmel Mocked Kanye West for Venturing Into ""Porn"" Two Years After Opening Church School","Who can predict what Kanye West will do next? The controversial rapper keeps everyone on their toes with his weird moves. This time, the musician amused the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel with his plans to start a pron studio which is a stark contrast to the church school he opened in his mother's name Donda School.

On April 25, 2024, Kimmel's monologue targeted many of his favorites including of course West on Jimmy Kimmel Live. The host opened up by introducing his audience with a piece of news that reportedly suggested Ye is in talks to enter into the film industry, pornographic industry, as per Daily Mail.
He said, ""It's about every night lately we start with our former president current defendant Donald Trump but um they take Wednesday off in court and I thought it might be nice for a change to check in on another disturbed egomaniac Kanye West tonight who is reportedly about to enter the world of films specifically the world of pornographic film with a new studio that is being called Yeezy porn.""

Kimmel's revelation triggered a hooting and laughing response from his audience as the host continued, ""Which is uh... the next logical step after opening a Pre-K through 12th grade Christian private school,"" taking a dig at the rapper, adding, ""He can't say he doesn't have range, right?""
He further said that a spokesperson for Yeezy said that Ye has been playing around with this idea of launching an ""adult film studio"" for a while. However, Kimmel sarcastically said that West doesn't make impulsive decisions instead he likes to think things through before acting upon them. ""That's the kind of business genius he is, he said you know what the internet could use... some porn,"" mocked Kimmel.
Additionally, the 56-year-old revealed Ye has reportedly been in talks with Stormy Daniel's ex-husband to ""shepherd the project."" Daniels, originally, Stephanie Gregory Clifford, accused former president Donald Trump of a sexual affair back in 2006 after meeting him at a golf charity in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. The infamous 'Hush Money' trial is ongoing currently in Manhattan court.
Meanwhile, Kimmel continued to roast the Praise God rapper, ""If you told me five years back that Kanye West would be working with Stormy Daniels' ex-husband on a porn venture, I would have said yeah I believe that, that's sad, doesn't make no sense.""
For those who needed some context to Kimmel's roast, TMZ reported West is setting up ties with Daniel's ex-partner Mike Moz who is a vet in the adult film industry. Moz told the outlet, ""I've been having discussions with Ye about a potential collab between the Yeezy brand and my team at Vixen Media Group. While it's too early to give any details I'm excited about where Ye's vision takes this.""
He added, ""The idea that this project is going to be another porn studio is not correct. It will be like nothing we've ever seen before."" However, he refused to elaborate further.",2024-04-27T02:57:59Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Erneut verklagt: Hat Kanye West Mitarbeiter diskriminiert?,"Im Jahr 2022 gründete der US-amerikanische Rapper Kanye West (46) eine christliche Privatschule in Kalifornien – die Donda-Academy. Nach wenigen Monaten wurde die Einrichtung jedoch wieder geschlossen. Der Grund: Es sei dort unter anderem zu rechtswidrigen Erziehungspraktiken gekommen. Laut Gerichtsunterlagen, die The Wrap vorliegen, ist das jedoch nur die Spitze des Eisbergs. In einer neu eingereichten Klage erhebt ein ehemaliger Sicherheitsmitarbeiter der Akademie schwere Vorwürfe gegen den Hollywoodstar. Aufgrund seiner Hautfarbe sei er von dem Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian (43) ""schwer diskriminiert, belästigt und schikaniert"" worden. ""Kanye schrie häufig schwarze Mitarbeiter an und beschimpfte sie, während er im Gegensatz dazu seinen Tonfall gegenüber weißen Mitarbeitern nie auch nur anhob"", heißt es in den Dokumenten.
Der Rapp-Star soll seinen Mitarbeitern sogar befohlen haben, alle Bücher über Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X (✝39) und andere prominente Persönlichkeiten der schwarzen Gemeinschaft zu entsorgen. Regelmäßig soll sich Kanye auch abfällig über weitere prominente schwarze Führungspersönlichkeiten geäußert haben. Doch der Wachmann soll anscheinend nicht nur aufgrund seiner Hautfarbe, sondern auch für seinen islamischen Glauben diskriminiert worden sein. Der Modedesigner soll ihn sogar aufgefordert haben, seine Dreadlocks abzuscheiden. Andernfalls hätte der ""Runaway""-Interpret ihm mit einer Entlassung gedroht.
Das ist nicht das erste Mal, dass Kanye mit rassistischen und diskriminierenden Aussagen für Negativschlagzeilen sorgt. Im vergangenen Jahr hatte es Kritik für den 46-Jährigen gehagelt, da er sich in einem Video antisemitisch geäußert hatte. Nach dem Clip entschuldigte sich Kanye bei der jüdischen Community. In Hebräisch postete der Musikproduzent auf Instagram: ""Es war nicht meine Absicht, zu verletzen oder jemanden verächtlich zu behandeln, und ich bedaure zutiefst jeden Schmerz, den ich möglicherweise zugefügt habe.""

Mike Moz, the ex-husband of famed porn star Stormy Daniels, is hyping up his and Kanye West’s upcoming “Yeezy Porn” business venture, sharing it’s unlike anything anyone has “seen before.”
“I’ve been having discussions with Ye about a potential collab between Yeezy brand and my team at Vixen Media Group,” the veteran adult entertainment industry executive told TMZ Friday.
“While it’s too early to give any details I’m excited about where Ye’s vision takes this.”
He added, “The idea that this project is going to be another porn studio is not correct. It will be like nothing we’ve ever seen before.”

Moz, who was briefly married to Daniels from 2007 to 2009, currently oversees Vixen Media Group and has produced nearly a dozen X-rated films, according to IMDb.
He didn’t provide too many details about how his and West’s ideas will translate onscreen, and it does not appear that his infamous ex, who was once allegedly paid off by Donald Trump to keep their affair a secret, will take part in the venture.
West’s rep previously told TMZ, however, that this new project was a concept that the “Gold Digger” rapper had been working on for some time and now seemed “dead set on doing it.”
West shared his excitement over the project by posting a clip on Instagram and X that read “Yeezy Porn Is Cumming,” while a woman’s voice could be heard driving followers to “go to yeezy.com.”
However, the Yeezy founder deleted his social media shortly after, following backlash over the announcement.

“I thought he was a Christian :/,” one person wrote via X, while another chimed in, “Doesn’t he have a Christian Academy??????”
In the past, West has admitted to being addicted to porn and said it even destroyed his family with ex-wife Kim Kardashian. The former couple shares four kids: North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4.
“Hollywood is a giant brothel Pornography destroyed my family I deal with the addiction instagram promotes it Not gonna let it happen to Northy and Chicago,” he said via Instagram in September 2022.
Two months later, following Balenciaga’s ad scandal — in which the fashion company featured children in bondage gear — West stood by the brand and slammed pornography instead.

However, since tying the knot with Bianca Censori that same month, West has shared several risqué photos of the Australian architect, wearing little-to-no clothing, latex masks and other porn-like attire.

"Kai Cenat Rips Kanye West For Calling Him An ""Industry Plant""","Kai Cenat is one of the biggest streamers on Twitch right now. Overall, he has built an exceptional brand through streaming. He has millions of followers on the platform, and he was one of the most subscribed to creators. Although he has had his fair share of controversies, there is no doubt that the fans still rock with him. Now, however, it seems as though Kai is at odds with none other than Kanye West. When Ye gets mad at someone, he will typically hold the grudge, and that has held true for his issues with Cenat.
It all started when Kai bought some Yeezy pants from Ye's website. Once he got the clothes, he quickly realized that they didn't fit very well. This led to a hilarious moment on stream that Ye did not find particularly funny. He eventually got into Kai's DMs and accused him of being paid off by Adidas. Subsequently, during an interview with Justin Laboy, Ye claimed that Cenat was an ""industry plant."" During his most recent stream, Cenat decided to address this comment, and he did not hold back.

Kai Cenat Responds
As you can see in the video above, Cenat notes that he has been streaming and making content since 2018. Furthermore, he makes it clear that this feud should have never happened, in the first place. Had Ye just sent him some pants that fit, there would be no problems. Either way, it feels like a feud that was very easily avoidable. Hopefully, cooler heads can prevail here, and the two get on some good terms.
Let us know what you think of this response from Kai Cenat, in the comments section down below. Do you believe that Kanye West will eventually come around and look to patch things up with Kai?

Kanye West se lance dans le X : sa femme Bianca Censori jouera-t-elle dans ses films ?,"Kanye West s'est trouvé une nouvelle passion peu commune : produire des films X. Le rappeur l'a confirmé, annonçant l'ouverture de Yeezy P*rn. Certains internautes se sont alors interrogés sur la présence de Bianca Censori dans ses films, au vu de son goût pour l'exhibitionnisme...

Il semblerait que Kanye West soit un passionné de contenus osés, et ce, depuis un certain temps. De fait, à l’époque, ce dernier, ne se cachait pas sur son plaisir à visionner des films réservés aux adultes. Toujours dans la démesure, l’homme de 46 ans a vu les choses en grand et s’est lancé dans une nouvelle aventure ! Un studio a été spécialement ouvert en l’honneur de ce projet afin d’y réaliser les longs métrages. C’est par le biais de sa marque Yeezy que l’artiste a créé ce nouveau lieu, partie intégrante de sa société.
Bianca Censori, actrice dans les films pour adultes de Kanye West ?
Kanye West ne sera pas le seul aux commandes de son projet. En effet, il a décidé de travailler aux côtés d’un Youtubeur, spécialiste en la matière, connu sous le nom de Mike Mozz. Par ailleurs, cette nouvelle a suscité des réactions chez les créateurs de contenus. Comme le Youtubeur Adam 22 qui a sans plus attendre, mis en garde Bianca Censori sur sa potentielle participation. Mais ce dernier ne s’est pas arrêté là… En effet, il a directement conseillé à Kanye West de garder Bianca Censori éloigné de ce projet. D’après ses dires, il pourrait regretter de la mettre en scène aux côtés d’autres personnes.
Les contenus pour adultes de Kanye West pourraient « pimenter les choses dans l’industrie »
Ce jeudi 25 avril 2024, auprès de TMZ, le podcasteur Adam22 a ouvertement donné son avis sur le lancement du Yeezy P*rn. Selon lui, l’idée de l’ex de Kim Kardashian pourrait être innovante, car adepte de ces contenus, il pourrait apporter une touche bien à lui. Ainsi, de son vrai nom, Adam Grandmaison imagine que Ye peut « pimenter les choses dans l’industrie ». Selon lui, la plupart des productions de films X, sont similaires, donc lassantes. Mais ses commentaires ne s’arrêtent pas là, puisque ce dernier met clairement en garde Kanye West sur le fait de ne pas confondre sa vie privée et professionnelle.
Bianca Censori manipulée ?
Si le Youtubeur est aussi impliqué dans cette histoire, c’est pour de bonnes raisons. « Je suppose que probablement Kanye ne voudrait pas avoir à faire avec les conneries qui viennent avec votre femme faisant du p*rn* ». En 2023, ce dernier a payé les frais d’avoir mélangé la diffusion de contenus pour adultes sur diverses plateformes comme OnlyFans, aux côtés de sa compagne. Par ailleurs, tout ne s’est pas passé comme prévu, puisqu’il a reçu de nombreuses critiques.
D’autant plus après la diffusion d’une scène avec un autre homme, Jason Luv. Ainsi, avec son message, il espère que Bianca Censori écoutera ses conseils face à un homme au comportement imprévisible. Ces derniers temps, Ye était d’ailleurs au centre des polémiques lors de ces nombreuses apparitions publiques où l’on aperçoit sa femme presque nue.",2024-04-26T13:39:38Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
Kanye West & His New Yeezy P*rn Venture Get Huge Endorsement From Stormy Daniels' Ex,"Kanye West shocked his fans this past week when he announced that he would be coming out with a new venture called Yeezy Porn. Overall, this was a bit of a surprise given the fact that Ye has been adamant about his issues with porn addiction. Moreover, he has tried to maintain some Christian beliefs, and this venture would completely go against that. In the end, fans are split on his new announcement, with many proclaiming more anger than they did when he was spewing White Nationalist talking points.
As it pertains to Yeezy Porn, it appears as though the venture is getting a huge endorsement from an industry veteran. That person just so happens to be Mike Moz, who used to be with Stormy Daniels. While speaking to TMZ, Moz expressed his admiration for Ye. Additionally, he noted that this venture is going to be revolutionary and that it isn't just going to be some sort of run of the mill porn operation.

"Just a Few Days After Startling Fans With New Revelation, Kanye West Deletes Instagram and X Again","After making a shocking statement about a new project for his Yeezy brand, Kanye West deleted his X and Instagram accounts. Fans were unable to access the music icon's accounts on Thursday. On Wednesday, April 24, the musician made his way to the platform with a little video clip that included the date, ""4-24-24,"" along with the brief statement, ""YEEZY PORN IS CUMMING,"" shown over a plain white backdrop.
Interestingly, this was in line with a TMZ story from earlier that day, which said the Chicago native was preparing to open a pornographic studio as a part of his current Yeezy empire's ""broader adult entertainment division.""

He received harsh criticism from fans for the decision. @limewire pic.twitter.com/BFJxqqtJ2B — Arthur (@ArthurBaitson) April 25, 2024
According to reports, the rapper will be collaborating with Mike Moz, the ex-husband of adult film actress Stormy Daniel. As reported by The Sun, following West's tweet, one fan said that they 'didn't want it' among other brief comments on the new business endeavor. West has already acknowledged on record that he is addicted to porn.
He revealed having a 'full-on pornography addiction' in a 2019 interview with Zane Lowe, which was conducted before the release of his family-friendly gospel album Jesus Is King.

As reported by The Daily Mail, West confessed at the time, ""For me, Playboy was my gateway into full-on pornography addiction. My dad had a Playboy left out at age five and it’s affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life. From age five ’til now, having to kick the habit and it just presents itself in the open like it’s okay and I stand up and say, ‘No, it’s not okay.""
He continued by attributing his recovery from addiction to his religion, saying: "" It’s like with God, I’ve been able to beat things that had a full control of me. You know that Playboy that I found when I was 5-years-old was written all over the moment when I was at the MTV Awards with the Timberlands, the Balmain jeans — before people was rocking Balmain jeans — and the Hennessy bottle. It’s like that was such a script out of a rock star’s life.""
Later, West was charged with regularly displaying to Adidas staff members explicit material, including intimate recordings of him and his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, during their profitable collaboration on Yeezy.
According to Rolling Stone, over twenty former employees of Adidas and Yeezy claimed that West showed them lewd pictures and videos during meetings. It is also said that during a job interview, West—who has legally changed his name to Ye—showed a potential employee an obscene photo of Kardashian.
At least five separate times, a former employee directly saw West play explicit movies during meetings, according to information provided to Rolling Stone. Workers said that his sexual allusions often made them feel uneasy. West is said to have informed a senior staff member, ""We create products of passion. I literally want to f–k my shoes. That’s how good they are.""",2024-04-26T11:21:11Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Kanye West's Ex Julia Fox Says Dating the Controversial Rapper Left a 'Sour Taste' in Her Mouth,"Kanye West's brief relationship with Julia Fox isn't as talked about as his relationship with ex-wife Kim Kardashian or his current partner Bianca Censori.
The Italian-American actress who dated Ye in 2022 recently recalled her time with the rapper. In an interview with InStyle, on April 25, 2024, she revealed why she called it quits within a month.

The Uncut Gems actress divulged, ""I mean, I think we all know what it is. Dating that man [West] for a month...That's why I have such a sour taste in my mouth about dating anyone in this sphere."" Fox emphasized that she wasn't willing to be overshadowed by her ex-partner's popularity.
She explained, ""Because I don't ever want to just be known as someone's girlfriend. I know I'm so much more than that. And I feel like that happens so much to women in this industry. They're only as good as their partner or they can make a whole career off being some guy's partner.""
The 34-year-old previously detailed the 'red flags' in dating West in her 2023 memoir Down the Drain. In her sit-down with The View, host Sunny Hostin discussed how Fox kept Ye's identity a secret in her book but opened up about 'signals' she initially ignored like West offering her a boob job, supervising her wardrobe, promising not to embarrass her, and proposing only a day after meeting her.
Fox disclosed that while there were many issues, she turned a 'blind eye' to them until the relationship became almost 'unsustainable'. BBC Radio's host Emma Barnett asked Fox in the show Woman's Hour in October 2023, about her relationship with an 'unnamed artist,' which people speculated to be Ye.
Fox answered, ""I think at the time there were definitely some red flags that I chose to turn a blind eye to because it was fun and exciting, and shiny, and you know just new. It felt like a relief in the beginning 'Oh finally someone else can take the reins', but I think you know it became unsustainable and that's why the relationship only lasted a month.""
In her interview with InStyle, Fox added that most women in this industry are living under the shadows of their partners and because she refuses to sign up for this regressive mindset, she let go of West. ""...It becomes their identity. And I feel like I have to transcend that, and I want to break that mold, and I want to just stand on my own two feet and not need a man to back me."" Netizens speculated that Fox's remarks about women being ""only as good as their partner"" was a swipe at Censori.

Kanye West Stakes Valuable Assets Like His Luxury Automobiles and Yeezy Apparel Company,"Kanye West offered many expensive properties as security in a series of mysterious loan agreements. These possessions include real estate, several opulent cars, and pieces of his Yeezy apparel brand. The purpose of the action is to improve Yeezy LLC's financial situation. As reported by The Sun, earlier this month, West's apparel umbrella, Yeezy LLC, signed a contract with the logistics company 1981 Distribution.

The 1981 Distribution company is managing Yeezy's inventory and shipment. The company specializes in distribution and warehousing facilities for online retailers. West pledged two luxury cars, his YZY Gap apparel line, 'various storage archive items', and a 'Stem Player designed by Teenage Engineering' as collateral for this deal, according to documents obtained by the outlet.
The UCC documents exposed a string of loans that West took out for the growth of his business empire starting in 2015. West also secured a second loan from CGB Agri Financial Services, which lends money and leases agricultural machinery. The debtors are listed under West and his Wyoming firm Psalm Cody Ranch LLC.

West's second debt is with Very Good Touring Inc., his touring firm, and City National Bank, also known as 'Bank to the Stars'. As per the publication, September 2015 saw the release of the loan, which was extended for a further five years, until April 2020. According to the documentation, the loan was again renewed for five more years. The final UCC is via the company Yeezy-Schloss, which was founded by designer Melissa Schloss, a former employee of West, who created her line of women's clothing.
In an agreement with Hildun Corporation in October 2022, West provided funding for the women's line. The names of Melissa and Yeezy Apparel are recorded as creditors for Hildun's services.
California sued Kanye West's Yeezy Apparel LLC and Yeezy LLC because it had repeatedly failed to ship orders within 30 days and did not send delay notices or offer refunds for ""speedier delivery"" prices. A $950,000 settlement has been reached. https://t.co/kG2LJyXrbZ — @cardenastician (@cardenastician) December 12, 2021
Reportedly, West's business dealings are on the line, and he is also involved in tax liens. A tax lien is a formal demand for outstanding debts placed on the property of a person or company. A lien may be placed on a business or taxpayer, according to the California Franchise Tax Board, if they fail to 'respond to our letters, pay in full, or set a payment plan'.
As reported by NBC News, as far back as 2012, California filed 17 more tax liens against three of Ye's companies as well as a charity that bears his name. The publication said that four of these liens were listed as current 'with no indication of them having been terminated or paid.' Experts concurred that the tax liens most likely 'pertained to payroll taxes', despite a California Employment Development Department spokesperson stating that the agency could not comment on taxpayer information.
As per Sourcing Journal, the most recent setback occurred in March of last year when Yeezy was hit with a $319,356.58 state tax debt from California. This resulted from the business's failure to pay $212,648.40 in taxes, which triggered a $9,644.40 interest payment and a $97,063.78 penalty.",2024-04-26T10:08:19Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Kanye West Passes Tasteless Remark About Wife Bianca Censori, Says She Looks Best ""Undressed""","Kanye West, who is infamous for his unfiltered mouth, made an inappropriate comment about his wife Bianca Censori during his recent podcast interview. The controversial rapper admitted that he prefers his wife ""undressed"" as the host Jalal Alkali left speechless and embarrassed.

Alkali raised questions about Ye's massive cultural influence, his music, and of course, his wife Censori who has been the tabloid's favorite for her near-naked body display. The nearly an hour-long interview was posted on April 23, 2024, on The Download Podcast's YouTube Channel where Ye was, in a way, grilled by the host, per The Sun.
Towards the middle of the chat, the Yeezy founder boasted he's still a driving force in the music industry, to which Alkali affirmed that the rapper has had the most number-one albums and singles in his career. The 46-year-old then referred to his wife as b***h and added, ""My b***h is the most influential b***h on the planet. My wife.""
The host echoed and complimented Censori is indeed the best dressed, to which Ye interjected and said she's the ""best undressed."" Both men laughed out loud at the musician's inappropriate comment while Alkali tread carefully with his words and said he ""couldn't speak on that.""
Since the couple got married in December 2022, they have been making headlines for the former architect's scandalous outfits and the public display of her private bits. People speculated that the Praise God rapper has been ""manipulating"" and ""controlling"" his wife on how to dress and how to speak.
Daily Mail previously reported that the former Yeezy employee has to follow strict rules and regulations set by her husband West, including specific foods and what she can wear, a source told the outlet. The insider also claimed that Censori doesn't have a mind of her own anymore and only obeys the controversial rapper who has convinced her that they are ""royalty.""
""Kanye has a set of rules for Bianca, which includes never speak and wear what he wants her to wear,"" the source added. ""She is also required to eat certain food items and to work out even though Kanye doesn't work out.""
Meanwhile, the report suggested her friends were worried to see the 29-year-old's jaw-dropping transformation. The source said, ""A few of her friends were finally able to reach her but she wasn't interested in talking, nor was she interested in anyone's concerns for her. She's shut everyone out and told one of her former friends to ""f*** off"" when they tried to ask if she was okay. She is saying that her friends are just jealous of her stardom.""
The fashion designers who have worked closely with West revealed the rapper has an ""atelier in Italy"" that creates bizarre and racy outfits for her. Mowalola Ogunlesi, the Nigerian-born, London-based designer hired by West in 2020 to head his Yeezy Gap collaboration, told Page Six, ""Anything he wants to make they can make it. He's really just making it on the spot.""

Die Zeichen jedenfalls stehen auf Sturm, wie es durch das Netz raunt, denn am Donnerstag löschte der Musiker, der bis vorletztes Jahr mit der Trash-Ikone Kim Kardashian liiert war, seinen Account bei X, vormals Twitter, gelöscht.
Auch sein Profil bei Instagram ist seit ein paar Wochen nicht mehr erreichbar, angeblich weil sich der 46-Jährige darüber ärgert, dass die amerikanischen Medien nicht bereit sind, ihn dauerhaft Ye zu nennen, sondern weiterhin unter seinem alten Namen Kanye West über ihn schreiben.
Aber auch die Preise des Album-Merchandisings lassen ahnen, dass es für Ye nicht mehr so blendend läuft wie in vergangenen Jahren, bevor sich das Wunderkind des HipHops selbst ins Aus manövrierte. Gerade einmal 19 Dollar sind fällig für ein „Vultures 1“-Shirt, das in Zusammenarbeit mit dem russischen Modemacher Gosha Rubchinskiy entstanden ist, der seit Dezember der Designchef von Yeezy ist. Ist der Ye-West-Hype vorbei?",2024-04-26T09:27:26Z,https://www.berliner-zeitung.de,Berliner Zeitung

Det började med att streamingstjärnan Kai Cenat testade Kanye Wests nya klädkollektion, men byxorna passade inte – utan var alldeles för stora. Något som han visade upp inför sin miljonpublik på Twitch.
Då rasade rapparen och skrev till honom privat på Instagram, och menade att han är en ”branschprodukt” som bara säger vad han blivit tillsagd att säga, enligt Dexerto.
”Gör inga skämt om mina kläder när du inte säger nåt om vad Adidas gör. När ”Vultures”-låten kom ut spelade du inte min vers. Du är kontrollerad. Lek inte med mig”, skriver West i ett av meddelandena som Cenat delat.
”Jag känner så här utan anledning?”
Kai Cenat försökte sen förklara att det inte var illa menat, utan att det bara var byxorna som inte hade passat. En förklaring som inte accepterades av Kanye West.
”Så du har inte gjort något fel? Så jag känner så här utan anledning?” svarar han.
Nu har Kai Cenat själv uttalat sig om det hela under en livesändning, där han riktar sig direkt till artisten.
– Vad i helvete mannen. Skicka mig bara nya byxor... allt det här för att byxorna inte passade? säger han.
Han slår också tillbaka mot anklagelserna om att han skulle vara en branschprodukt.",2024-04-26T08:36:53Z,https://www.expressen.se,Expressen

Kanye West stäms - diskriminerade svart personal,"Kanye Wests tidigare säkerhetsvakt stämmer nu honom och Donda Academy. Foto: EVAN AGOSTINI / AP TT NYHETSBYRÅN
Kanye, eller Ye, Wests tidigare säkerhetsvakt Benjamin Deshon Provo menar att rapparen ständigt betedde sig nedsättande mot honom och andra svarta anställda, men att vit personal gynnades. Benjamin Deshon Provo stämmer nu Kanye West för behandlingen av svart personal på den kristna skolan Donda Academy, som rapparen startade 2022, enligt Daily Mail.
Bland annat rör det sig om lönediskriminering. Provo menar att Kanye betalade närmare 54 kronor mindre i lön till svarta anställda jämfört med vita. När Provo tog upp frågan med Kanyes manager, John Hicks, svarade han att Kanye inte gillar att prata pengar, skriver Daily Mail.
”Säg till den med dreads att raka huvudet”
Den tidigare säkerhetsvakten ska också ha blivit sparkad av Hicks efter att han vägrat att raka sitt huvud. Enligt stämningsansökan ska Kanye ha sagt till sin manager:
– Säg till den med dreads att raka huvudet annars får han sparken.
Provo är inte ensam om att stämma Kanye. Tidigare i april stämde Trevor Phillips, en tidigare anställd på skolan, honom för att ha sagt till eleverna att han skulle sätta ett ”fängelse” på skolan där de kunde låsas in i burar, skriver Daily Mail.
Phillips hävdade också att rapparen hotade att slå honom under ett ”utbrott” och ofta använde antisemitisk och anti-HBTQ+-retorik i närheten av studenter.
Provo stämmer Kanye West och Donda Academy för bland annat diskriminering, fientlig arbetsmiljö och brott mot olika arbetslagar.

Kanye West's ex flays him for damaging Bianca Censori's identity,"Julia Fox believes Bianca Censori lost her spark after marrying Kanye West
Kanye West's ex-girlfriend, Julia Fox seemingly took a dig at the rapper for damaging his wife Bianca Censori's identity.
The model, who dated the Yeezy founder for a brief period of time in 2022, indirectly took a dig at the Australian beauty by saying that she now only knows as Kanye's wife.
In conversation with InStyle, Julia shared, ""I feel like that happens so much to women in this industry.""
She added, ""They're only as good as their partner or they can make a whole career off being some guy's partner.""
Julia seemingly referenced Kanye and Bianca's controversial romance and said, that such high-profile relationships become the ""identity"" of women.
Moreover, the actress also emphasised the fact that she does not want to be known only as the Runway singer's former partner.
Julia said, ""I mean, I think we all know what it is. Dating [Kanye] for a month-one month. That's why I have such a sour taste in my mouth about dating anyone in this sphere.""
It is pertinent to mention that since the rapper's marriage to Bianca in 2020, the couple made it to the headlines due to the Architectural designer's racy outfit choices.
As per several reports, Bianca has been pressured by Kanye to adopt this lifestyle.

Adam22 cautions Kanye West against casting Bianca Censori in explicit Yeezy content,"Kanye West and his wife, Bianca Censori, have received a strong warning from one of the porn industry's most notable and controversial stars, Adam22, regarding Kanye's surprising new venture into adult films.
The rapper announced on Wednesday via social media that he is entering the world of X-rated entertainment with a new project titled Yeezy Porn.
Adam22 who works as an adult film star alongside his wife, Lena the Plug, offered some advice to Kanye, urging him to avoid involving Bianca in any of his adult projects.
""I would assume that probably he would not want to be dealing with the bulls**t that comes with your wife doing porn,"" Adam22 told TMZ.
He sees potential for West in the industry, noting that the rapper's ""creative vision"" could bring a fresh perspective to an industry he describes as often stale.

"Kanye West faces lawsuit over screaming, fired employee over hairstyle","Kanye West sued by former Donda Academy employee for alleged wage discrimination.
Kanye West is facing a new lawsuit over allegations of discrimination at his now-shuttered Donda Academy.
A former employee, Benjamin Deshon Provo, has filed a suit in Los Angeles court, claiming the rapper screamed at black staff members and paid them less than their white colleagues.
According to the lawsuit, Provo, who worked as a security guard, alleges that white staff were paid at least $5 more per hour than their black counterparts.
The lawsuit also accuses West of pressuring Provo to shave off his dreadlocks, highlighting a pattern of discriminatory practices.
This comes on the heels of previous claims suggesting that West threatened to shave students' heads and lock them in cages at academy, which he established in 2022 as an exclusive, unaccredited Christian private school for children aged four to 18.
West now has to address these serious allegations of workplace discrimination and unfair treatment.
According to court documents obtained by MailOnline, former employee Benjamin Deshon Provo claims West demanded that he shave his dreadlocks, saying, ""Alright y’all, it is time for you to shave your heads.
I am not messing around."" When Provo refused, he alleges that an associate of West told him, ""Kanye said, Tell the one with the dreads to shave his head or he is fired."" Provo refused to comply, leading to his termination.
West known for his varied ventures from music to fashion to education, is now turning heads with his latest plan to enter the adult film industry.
This move comes just two years after he opened Donda.
During his opening monologue on Wednesday's show, Kimmel quipped about Kanye's unconventional business choices, saying that launching an adult film studio was ""the next logical step after opening a pre-K through 12th grade Christian private school.""
He added: ""You can't say he doesn't have range, right?""",2024-04-25T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Julia Fox Says Kanye West Romance Left a ‘Sour Taste’ in Her Mouth,"Julia Fox wants to be known for more than just the girl who dated Kanye West. No matter how much time passes since her month-long romance with the rapper came to an end, Julia, 34, says it’s hard for some people to look past her relationship history.
In a new interview with InStyle published on Thursday, April 25, Julia was asked if she could relate to Cardi B’s words that, “No matter what I accomplish, I still get called a stripper.” Without hesitation, Julia said people continue to perceive her as Kanye’s girlfriend.
“That’s why I have such a sour taste in my mouth about dating anyone in this sphere,” she told the publication. “Because I don’t ever want to just be known as someone’s girlfriend. I know I’m so much more than that. And I feel like that happens so much to women in this industry. They’re only as good as their partner or they can make a whole career off being some guy’s partner. But regardless, either way, it becomes their identity.”
Julia continued, “I feel like I have to transcend that and I want to break that mold and I want to just stand on my own two feet and not need a man to back me. I did that for years.”
Kanye, 46, and Julia were first linked at the beginning of 2022 when they rang in a new year together. One month later, a rep for the actress confirmed to Us Weekly that the couple are no longer together but remain “good friends and collaborators.”
During her candid interview, Julia was also asked if she fell into fame or fame found her. While her big break came from starring in the 2019 film Uncut Games, Julia believes she was always a “hood celebrity.”
“People always knew me and I was always around,” she explained. “But I think that had to do with the fact that I was just really crazy and rowdy and I had a fat ass and guys really liked me. And I would smoke blunts with the guys. I would get into fights with people. I was just known for being a terror. So it was more like an infamy.”
As Julia continues raising her 3-year-old son Valentino with ex Peter Artemiev, the best-selling author is hoping that her career is just getting started. She’s hard at work making music and preparing to launch a new fashion show on E! with stylist Law Roach.
“I want to do everything,” she proclaimed. “I want to write more books, I want to write movies. I still want to act, I want to do my fashion stuff. I want to do more art. …I’m never satisfied.”

Jimmy Kimmel on Trump: ‘He keeps his caps lock tighter than the door to Melania’s bedroom’,"Late-night hosts talked Donald Trump’s Truth Social rants, Biden’s potential TikTok ban and House speaker Mike Johnson’s “courage”.
Jimmy Kimmel
After plenty of focus on the former president, Jimmy Kimmel turned to another favorite target on Wednesday evening: Kanye West, who is reportedly launching an adult film studio. “He said, ‘You know what the internet could use? Some porn,’” Kimmel joked.
Yeezy Porn is reportedly in development with Stormy Daniels’s ex-husband, the producer Mike Moz. “If you had told me five years ago that Kanye West would be working with Stormy Daniels’s ex-husband on a porn venture, I would’ve said … yeah, I can believe that,” said Kimmel. “That doesn’t make no sense.”
In congressional news, the Senate voted on Wednesday to approve a bill that will either ban TikTok or force a sale of the short-form video app by its China-based parent company, ByteDance, within the year. A potential world without TikTok is “terrifying”, said Kimmel. “Without TikTok, where will I watch videos of wealthy teenagers crying in their cars?”
The Biden administration also decided to let elementary schools keep serving chocolate milk. “Could you imagine if Biden banned TikTok and chocolate milk in the same week?” Kimmel mused. “There would’ve been a middle school January 6.”
Trump, meanwhile, has been “milking this gag order for every bit he can”, by ranting about it on Truth Social. “The way he goes on and on – you’d think he was on trial for the gag order instead of for paying off a porn star,” said Kimmel.
“Every post is in all caps,” he continued, noting several posts of “WITCH HUNT” and “ELECTION INTERFERENCE” with various levels of punctuation. “He keeps his caps lock tighter than the door to Melania’s bedroom.”

On the Daily Show, the guest hosts Jordan Klepper and Ronny Chieng celebrated the Senate’s passage of a long-stalled $95bn military aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. “Yes, Taiwan. No, they’re not at war yet, but you’ve got to book a reservation in advance just to save your spot,” Klepper joked.
The package had been held up for six months in the House, because rightwing Republicans such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz threatened to remove the House speaker, Mike Johnson, from his office if he helped Ukraine. “But now that they let it go through, everyone’s been talking about him like this,” said Klepper, before several clips praising Johnson’s “courage”.
“Moral courage,” as Mike Pence put it. “That’s courage,” said the hosts of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. “So apparently Mike Johnson is the hero here,” said Klepper. “Sure, a couple of Ukrainian cities fell while he decided whether or not to be courageous, but he got around to it. And we’re always praising the first responders, but what about the eventual responders, huh? The ones who jump in their firetruck and say, ‘Hey! Let’s stop for froyo on the way.’ Where’s their ticker tape parade?”
“I salute you, Mike Johnson,” co-host Chieng added. “I mean, not now. But six months from now, I’ll work up the courage to do it.”",2024-04-25T15:19:08Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
Kanye West Divulges On Falling Out With Pusha T,"Kanye West's recent interview with Justin LaBoy on his The Download podcast did a whole lot more than add another solider to the Drake coup d'état taking over hip-hop right now. Moreover, it also saw him open up about a lot of industry relationships, past claims and beefs, and what the future might hold. One particularly interesting part was when Ye reflected on his relationship with Pusha T, former G.O.O.D. Music president and frequent collaborator. The two seemed to fall out following Push's comments on his former partner's antisemitic and right-wing ties and behavior, but the Yeezy mogul also suggested that they aren't completely disconnected right now.
""I just spoke with Pusha the other day,"" Kanye West remarked. ""It was good to talk to him. It was the first time talking to him in a couple months. We made good music together. I thought that somehow because I made beats and made music for somebody that when I couldn’t see my children, these people would use their platform. ‘Cause I used my platform on their behalf. Now I realize no one owes me anything... If you depend on somebody who is not giving you what you need, you’re the one that’s in the wrong.""

Meanwhile, this is what Pusha T had to say to XXL about Kanye West's worrisome behavior and affiliations in late 2022, which he expressed in tandem with his departure from G.O.O.D. Music. ""It’s beyond that and it’s nothing to tap dance around,"" he posited. ""It’s wrong. Period. But to me, it’s just me and him having a difference of opinion yet again. ’Cause we done had this for years. He’s not speaking to me now. If you ain’t with it, you ain’t down. And I ain’t with it. I’m not budging on that. I’m not with it.
""I heard about this new stuff,"" the Clipse MC shared, possibly alluding to Ye's appearances on right-wing-adjacent media like InfoWars or Fox News. ""I don’t know. It’s something that just sort of tells me he’s not well, at the same time. I will say that. It’s going to places where it’s no way to move around it. Remember, I’m the one that said the MAGA hat is the new Klu Klux Klan hood while he’s making my album. He beefing with Obama. I met Obama. But it’s the same thing with him and the Drake thing. I’m going through this and that, he’s doing shows [with him].""

Μετά τη δολοφονία του 2Pac και του Notorious B.I.G. έπειτα από ένα παρόμοιο beef τα πνεύματα φάνηκε ότι είχαν ηρεμήσει, τελευταία όμως έχουν επανέλθει επειδή μάλλον είναι κάτι που πουλάει και το χιπ-χοπ τελευταία βρίσκεται ομολογουμένως σε κρίση.
Μπορεί να πει κανείς ότι όλα ξεκίνησαν με το Big Foot της Nicki Minaj, ένα αρκετά σκληρό, diss κομμάτι εναντίον της ράπερ Megan Thee Stallion. Και οι δύο βγήκαν κερδισμένες, με τη Megan Thee Stallion να κατακτά την κορυφή του Billboard με το Hiss και τη Minaj να κερδίζει τη μάχη με αξιομνημόνευτες ρίμες. Αυτό είδαν οι διάσημοι συνάδελφοί τους και ξεσηκώθηκαν.

Το 2013, μετά την επιτυχία του ντεμπούτου άλμπουμ του, Good Kid, m.A.A.d City, ο Lamar αποστασιοποιήθηκε από τους υπόλοιπους ράπερ της γενιάς του. Στο κομμάτι του Big Sean, Control, όπου έκανε γκεστ εμφάνιση, ράπαρε «σας αγαπώ όλους, αλλά θα προσπαθήσω να σας δολοφονήσω».
Έτσι, έχουμε το πρόσφατο beef του Kendrick Lamar με τους Drake και J. Cole. Ανταγωνισμός πάντοτε υπήρχε, απ’ ό,τι φαίνεται, μεταξύ τους, αλλά ποτέ δεν σοβάρεψαν τόσο τα πράγματα όσο τώρα. Όμως ας πάρουμε τα πράγματα από την αρχή.
Πώς ξεκίνησε το beef
Όταν ο Kendrick Lamar ήταν ακόμη ανερχόμενος, ο Drake προσφέρθηκε να τον βοηθήσει, προσκαλώντας τον να συμμετάσχει στο άλμπουμ του Take Care και να τον ανοίγει στην περιοδεία του το 2012. Έναν χρόνο μετά, το 2013, μετά την επιτυχία του ντεμπούτου άλμπουμ του, Good Kid, m.A.A.d City, ο Lamar αποστασιοποιήθηκε από τους υπόλοιπους ράπερ της γενιάς του. Στο κομμάτι του Big Sean, Control, όπου έκανε γκεστ εμφάνιση, ράπαρε «σας αγαπώ όλους, αλλά θα προσπαθήσω να σας δολοφονήσω». Ο Drake δεν έδωσε και πολλή σημασία τότε. Πετούσαν κακιούλες μεταξύ τους πού και πού, αλλά τίποτα ιδιαίτερο.
Τι συνέβη πρόσφατα;
Όπως όλα δείχνουν, υπεύθυνος είναι ο J. Cole. Πέρσι τον Οκτώβριο, ο Drake κυκλοφόρησε το όγδοο άλμπουμ του, For All The Dogs, μέσα στο οποίο υπήρχε μια συνεργασία του με τον J. Cole στο κομμάτι First Person Shooter, όπου ο J. Cole δήλωνε ότι αυτός, ο Drake και ο Kendrick ήταν τα τρία μεγάλα ονόματα τότε στο ραπ. Το κομμάτι ανέβηκε στην κορυφή του Billboard, το πρώτο με το οποίο κατάφερνε κάτι τέτοιο ο Cole και αυτό με το οποίο ισοφάρισε ο Drake το ρεκόρ του Michael Jackson. Ο Kendrick, απ’ ό,τι φαίνεται, δεν χάρηκε πολύ με τη συγκεκριμένη εξέλιξη και τους το κρατούσε για καιρό.
Πώς αντέδρασε ο Kendrick;
Τον Μάρτιο του 2024, ο Metro Boomin’ και ο Future κυκλοφόρησαν ένα κοινό άλμπουμ με τίτλο We Don’t Trust You. Κρυμμένο στο tracklist ήταν ένα τραγούδι που ονομαζόταν Like That και είχε έναν μη υπογεγραμμένο στίχο από τον Kendrick Lamar, με το οποίο έγινε χαμός στο X (πρώην Τwitter). Ο Kendrick δεν μάσησε τα λόγια του και έβαλε στο στόχαστρο τον στίχο του Cole, υποστηρίζοντας ότι δεν υπάρχουν τρεις σπουδαίοι, υπάρχει μόνο ο ίδιος («big three – it’s just big me»). Αποκάλεσε τον Drake και τον Cole «ένα ελαφρύ πακέτο» και δήλωσε ότι είναι Prince σε σχέση με τον Michael Jackson του Drake. Κλείνει το κομμάτι λέγοντας ότι θα στείλει όλα τα σκυλιά του Drake και του J. Cole στο νεκροταφείο των ζώων, κάνοντας αναφορά στο διάσημο μυθιστόρημα τρόμου του Stephen King, Pet Cemetery, του 1983. Ο στίχος κάνει ταυτόχρονα και μια αναφορά στον τίτλο του άλμπουμ του Drake, For All The Dogs. Αξίζει, επίσης, να σημειωθεί ότι ο Metro Boomin’ είναι πρώην συνεργάτης του Drake και συχνά δηλώνει σε συνεντεύξεις ότι δεν χωνεύει τον Καναδό ράπερ επειδή τον έριξε σε μια συνεργασία τους που επρόκειτο να γίνει, αλλά τελικά δεν υλοποιήθηκε ποτέ. Μάλιστα, έχει τέτοιο μένος εναντίον του που αφαίρεσε τα φωνητικά του από το τραγούδι Trance.

Απάντησε ο Drake;
Φυσικά και απάντησε, και αυτός και ο Cole, με τον δεύτερο να το μετανιώνει. Ο Drake αρχικά έκανε κάτι περίεργες δηλώσεις σε μια συναυλία του στη Φλόριντα σχετικά, αλλά δεν τελείωσε εκεί το ζήτημα. Δύο εβδομάδες μετά από αυτό το περιστατικό ο Cole έδωσε τη δική του απάντηση στον Kendrick με το κομμάτι 7 Minute Drill από το άλμπουμ-έκπληξη, Might Delete Later. Στο κομμάτι έκανε κριτική στη δισκογραφία του Kendrick, αποκαλώντας το ντεμπούτο του «κλασικό», αλλά την πιο πρόσφατη προσπάθειά του, το Mr Morale and the Big Steppers, τραγική. Κάτι τον έπιασε όμως και γρήγορα πήρε πίσω το diss, συνειδητοποιώντας ότι ήταν ένα τεράστιο λάθος και «το πιο χαζό και ανόητο πράγμα που έχω ηχογραφήσει ποτέ», όπως δήλωσε κατά τη διάρκεια της εμφάνισης του στο φετινό Dreamville. Ζήτησε συγγνώμη από τον Lamar και η κόντρα τους έληξε εκεί.
Ο Drake όμως δεν πτοήθηκε από την προδοσία του Cole. Κυκλοφόρησε επίσημα το Push Ups, που αρχικά διέρρευσε. Σε αυτό εν ολίγοις αποκαλεί τον Lamar κοντό, ενώ υπονοεί ότι άλλοι καλλιτέχνες όπως η SZA, o Travis Scott και ο 21 Savage τον έχουν ξεπεράσει . Έβαλε στον διάλογο και τους Future, The Weeknd, Rick Ross.
Εκτός από τον Drake, ενοχλήθηκε και η μαμά του
Μέσα σε λίγες ώρες από το diss του Drake, ο Rick Ross πήρε τον λόγο με το Champagne Moments, ισχυριζόμενος ότι ο Καναδός σταρ έχει κάνει πλαστική, συμπεριλαμβανομένων μιας επέμβασης στη μύτη και ενός brazilian butt lift. Αυτή η κατηγορία είχε ως αποτέλεσμα η μαμά του Drake να του στείλει μήνυμα για να τον ρωτήσει αν οι φήμες είναι αληθινές. Ο ράπερ μοιράστηκε τη συζήτησή τους στο Instagram.
Τα πράγματα δεν τελείωσαν εκεί. Στον χορό μπήκε και ο Kanye West που πήρε το μέρος του Lamar με ένα remix του Like That, όπου έβαλε στο στόχαστρο τη δισκογραφική του Drake. Στο μεταξύ, ο Drake έβγαλε και δεύτερο κομμάτι, το Taylor Made Freestyle, στο οποίο κατηγόρησε τον Lamar ότι φοβάται να κυκλοφορήσει κάτι επειδή η Taylor Swift έβγαλε καινούργιο άλμπουμ. Επιπλέον, στο ίδιο κομμάτι χρησιμοποίησε τεχνητή νοημοσύνη για να μιμηθεί τη φωνή δύο ηρώων του Lamar, των Tupac Shakur και Snoop Dogg.
Το κερασάκι στην τούρτα όμως έβαλε η Taylor Swift που στο άλμπουμ της The Tortured Poets Department diss-άρει τον άσπονδο εχθρό της Kanye West και την πρώην του, Kim Kardashian.

"Snakes, diss tracks and Kanye West: a timeline of Kim Kardashian and Taylor Swift's beef","It seems like the bitter feud between Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian just unlocked a new chapter
Swift and Kardashian's long-standing beef really begins with Kardashian's ex-husband Kanye West's complicated history with the singer. Almost two decades ago, the then-19-year-old Swift won the 2009 VMA for the best female video, edging out Beyoncé's video for ""Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)."" In the infamous televised moment during Swift's acceptance speech, West hopped on stage, grabbed a mic and interrupted with, “Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you and I’mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time!”
The fallout was swift — literally. West was condemned by the likes of former President Barack Obama and even Beyoncé herself. Later that same evening, while Bey accepted her Video of the Year award, she brought out Swift to join her on stage. Little did West and Swift know that moment would have a domino effect that would play out for years to come and even involve West's now ex-wife Kardashian.
After initial apologies from West, the singer and rapper made up and in 2015, Swift even presented West with the Video Vanguard Award at VMAs. However, their budding relationship quickly soured a year later when West debuted his song ""Famous."" The line, ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/Why? I made that b***h famous"" caused a stir and went viral. Swift's team denied that she had ever approved the lines. Kardashian swooped in and defended her husband, and the rest is history.
Swift is now at the height of her superstardom and continues to blow upon the embers of a feud that seemingly ended but now has been renewed in a new diss track ""thanK you aIMee"" on her dual album, ""The Tortured Poets Department."" In light of this revival, Salon looked back at the women's enmity and how it's played out publicly.
Here's everything you need to know about the long-standing beef between Kardashian and Swift:
February 11, 2016: Kanye releases “Famous”
The song that started it all was released eight years ago. Its virality prompted the question of whether Swift had approved being mentioned in the song. West said that he had received permission from Swift, but this was later disputed by Swift's team. He said that he “called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line,” that she “thought it was funny,” “gave her blessings,” and even “came up with” the lyric, GQ reported.
Years before its release Kardashian was quoted saying that she loves Swift. ""I’m the biggest Taylor Swift fan.” In 2015, they were seen together hugging at awards like the Grammys and the VMAs. However, when ""Famous"" was shared with the world, it did irreparable damage to the women's relationship.
June 2016: Swift's spokesperson denies the song approval
A statement from Swift’s PR team argued that “Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ‘Famous’ on her Twitter account. She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, ‘I made that b***h famous.’”
Kanye continued to stress that Swift approved of the lines in ""Famous.""
June 16, 2016: Kardashian says Swift knew about the ""Famous"" lines
In an interview with GQ, Kardashian stoked the fire in the brewing feud. When asked if Swift has actually approved the lines in the song, Kardashian said, “She totally approved that.
“She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn't. I swear, my husband gets so much s**t for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.” She continued, “What rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?”
June 2016: Swift's team responds to Kardashian's comments
Swift's team said, ""Taylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West.
""However, that does not change the fact that much of what Kim is saying is incorrect. Kanye West and Taylor only spoke once on the phone while she was on vacation with her family in January of 2016 and they have never spoken since,"" the statement continued. ""Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do.""
June 24, 2016: West releases ""Famous"" video
The music video also pushed boundaries by featuring West, Kardashian naked and in bed surrounded by celebrity lookalikes, one of whom bore a resemblance to Swift. West himself said that he had nothing to say about the actors in the video. He said it was a ""comment on fame"" and then tweeted, “Can somebody sue me already #I’llwait.”
July 17, 2016: Kardashian explains why she defended West
In a new episode of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"" Kardashian shared more about her perspective on the situation between West and Swift.
She said that when she did her GQ interview, she felt like she had to respond. ""I never talk s**t about anyone publicly, especially in interviews. But I was just like, I had so had it,"" she said. ""I wanted to defend him in it.”
At the end of the episode, Kardashian and her mom, Kris Jenner sat down to discuss the controversy. Jenner asked her daughter, ""What would happen if you just called Taylor up and say 'What happened? How did this go so south?' I guess I don't understand the motivation to flip . . . maybe she took it the wrong way. My advice would be to give Taylor Swift a call.""
""Thank you for your lovely advice,"" Kardashian replied, ""but I'm not going to take it.
July 17, 2016: Kim Kardashian releases video footage of Kanye West's phone call with Taylor Swift
Kardashian went on Snapchat to share the elusive videos she had been hinting at during her GQ interview. The videos were seemingly of a phone call between West and Swift talking about the ""Famous"" lyrics.
""It's like a compliment,"" Swift said in the video after West read the lyrics, ""For all my Southside n***a that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.""
West said to Swift, ""What I give a f**k is you as a person, and as a friend, I want things that make you feel good."" He also thanked Swift ""for being like, so cool about it"" after she said she appreciated the ""heads up"" on the lyrics.
""I never would've expected you to like tell me about a line in your song,"" Swift said. ""I mean, I don't think anybody would listen to that and be like, 'Oh, that's a real diss.' You gotta tell the story that way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it.""
Shed continued, ""If people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like, 'He called me and told me before it came out . . . Joke's on you, guys. We're fine.'""
Swift's spokesperson told People Magazine, ""Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyrics, 'I made that b***h famous.'""
July 17, 2016: Swift defends herself after leaked footage
Swift responded immediately. She said that the phone call never showed West telling her he was going to call her ""that b***h.""
""It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that b***h' in front of the entire world,"" she said.
""Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did,"" Swift said. ""While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.
""I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009,"" Swift continued. She captioned the post, ""That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.""
It wasn't long before the internet thought Swift was public enemy No. 1. Countless snake emojis flooded the singer's comments on Instagram and Twitter. She was essentially canceled as people online cheered #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty and #KimExposedTaylorParty.
August 27, 2017: Swift references West and Kardashian in “Look What You Made Me Do” music video
A year later after the star had removed herself from the public eye, she released the song “Look What You Made Me Do” and its music video. The musician also teased the release of her sixth studio album, ""Reputation."" The album's theme clearly highlighting the public's condemnation and cancellation of Swift.
But for “Look What You Made Me Do,"" the singer had essentially reclaimed the snake imagery that people had so closely associated her with for a year. In the video, she has the quote, “Et tu, Brute” from William Shakespeare’s ""Julius Caesar"" written on her chair as a reference to West stabbing her in the back.
At the end of the video, she references the drama with different past “versions of herself” lined up in a row, including one that kept taking videos on her phone, saying, “I’m going to edit this later.”
November 10, 2017: Swift releases ""Reputation,"" aiming right at Kardashian and West
In songs like “I Did Something Bad,” Swift sings, “I never trust a narcissist, but they love me,” and, “If a man talks s**t, then I owe him nothin’, I don’t regret it one bit ’cause he had it coming.”
“This is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things"" alluded to Swift and West's relationship rekindling and how she felt tricked by the musician and wife's motives. She described the rapper as “shady."" She sings ""And here’s to you / ‘Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do / Hahaha, I can’t even say it with a straight face.”
January 14, 2019: Kardashian denies a feud with Swift
During an interview with Andy Cohen on ""Watch What Happens Live,"" Cohen asked Kardashian about Swift. She said she was ""over it.""
""I feel like we'd all moved on,"" Kardashian stated.
April 2019: Swift says she hasn't received an apology
However, Swift said in Elle, “I learned that disarming someone’s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. . . . In my experience, I’ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet.
“It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I’ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it,” she continued.

March 2020: The “Famous” phone call fully leaks
Four years after the initial incident, the full video leaked. In the clip, Swift was seemingly relieved that she was not “that stupid dumb b***h” that West raps about in the song.
“I’m going to send you the song and send you the exact wording and everything about it, right? And then we could sit and talk through it,” West said to her.
Swift addressed the leak:
“Instead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family and fans through hell for 4 years) . . . SWIPE UP to see what really matters,” wrote Swift, a link to the World Health Organization days after it declared the COVID-19 pandemic,"" she said.
Kardashian followed with a statement too. “To be clear, the only issue I ever had around the situation was that Taylor lied through her publicist who stated that ‘Kanye never called to ask for permission,’” she said. “They clearly spoke so I let you all see that. Nobody ever denied the word ‘bitch’ was used without her permission.”
December 2023: Taylor said the public cancellation was a “career death”
Swift dominated last year, even snagging the title of TIME's person of the year. In the magazine, the singer talked about her career and how it has been through its highs and lows.
“Make no mistake — my career was taken away from me,” she said of the leaked phone call.
“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” she said. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”
April 19, 2024: Swift releases ""The Tortured Poets Department"" with diss track ""thanK you aIMee""
Eight years after the leaked phone call and the immediate backlash against Swift, she released her 11th studio album with the song ""thanK you aIMee"" on it. The song title not-too-subtly capitalizes the letters K, I and M, in reference to Kardashian.
In the song, Swift refers to Aimee as a bully and spends most of the song yelling, ""f**k you Aimee.""
Swift sings, ""I don't think you've changed much/And so I changed your name and any real defining clues/And one day, your kid comes home singing/A song that only us two is gonna know is about you."" This has widely been speculated to be referring Kardashian and her daughter North West, singing and dancing to one of Swift's songs on TikTok.",2024-04-25T01:37:50Z,https://www.salon.com,Salon
"Kanye West Officially Announces ""Yeezy P*rn,"" Adam22 Thinks Bianca Censori Shouldn't Get Involved","It's no secret that Kanye West is a man of many endeavors, and recently, reports surfaced claiming he'll be adding yet another to the list. According to TMZ, Ye plans to open a brand new ""Yeezy porn"" studio as early as this summer. He's teaming up with Stormy Daniels' ex Mike Moz for the unexpected venture. Ye shared the news officially on his YouTube channel today, alongside a brief message.
While Ye appears to be on his way to breaking new ground, not all of his fans are thrilled about it. Amid the reports, he's received a great deal of backlash online. Religious supporters, and those who recall him admitting to having a porn addiction, continue to criticize him for the bold move. According to Adam22, however, he could have a positive impact on the industry as a whole.
Kanye West Says Adult Content Is On The Way
During a recent interview with TMZ, the No Jumper host weighed in on the reports of Ye's new venture. He also offered the mogul some words of advice. ""The main thing that I think that Kanye could bring to the porn world, aside from just more eyeballs, would just be him sort of adding to the aesthetic component,"" he explained.
""Cuz if you look at the brands that have come out over the years that have really kind of changed things in terms of porn, I think just like creating new imagery and like changing up the visuals. Cuz porn does tend to get kind of stale,"" he also added.

Adam22 then went on to answer the question of whether or not he thinks Ye himself, or his wife Bianca Censori, will ever get in front of the camera. He says it's unlikely.

Nach Kritik an Pornostudio: Kanye West löscht Social Media!,"Kanye West (46) hat seine Social-Media-Kanäle gelöscht. Vor wenigen Stunden deaktivierte der Rapper sowohl sein Instagram- als auch sein X-Profil. Der Schritt kam kurz nachdem der ""Stronger""-Interpret für seine Pläne, ein Pornofilmstudio zu gründen, einiges an Kritik einstecken musste. Vielen Fans stieß besonders sauer auf, dass der Musiker vor ein paar Jahren noch ein Album, das er Jesus widmete, veröffentlicht hatte und nun in die Erotikbranche einsteigen wolle. Auf besagten Profilen waren Kommentare wie ""Ich dachte, du hast dein Leben Christus gegeben, was ist passiert, Mann? Hast du es zurückgenommen oder was?"" oder ""Du hast deine Seele an den Teufel verkauft"" zu finden.
Mit einem kurzen Video-Clip kündigte der Musiker seinen Einstieg in die Porno-Industrie an. Sechs Sekunden lang wurde das Datum des 24. April 2024 gezeigt. Darunter standen die Worte ""Yeezy Porn kommt"". Der Rapper scheint es mit seinen Plänen ernst zu meinen. Wie ein Insider gegenüber TMZ verriet, soll Ye bereits mit möglichen Partnern verhandelt haben. Für einen optimalen Start ins Porno-Business soll er sich Unterstützung von jemand ganz Besonderen geholt haben: Mike Moz, der Ex-Mann von Pornostar Stormy Daniels (45). Mike ist bereits seit mehreren Jahrzehnten als Produzent in der Branche tätig.
Pornos scheinen in Yes Leben schon immer eine große Rolle gespielt zu haben. 2019 gestand er in einem Interview mit dem Radiosender Beats 1, dass er pornosüchtig ist. Bereits im Alter von nur fünf Jahren sei der ""Famous""-Interpret mit der Erwachsenenunterhaltung in Berührung gekommen. ""Mein Vater hatte im Alter von fünf Jahren einen Playboy ausliegen, und das hat fast jede Entscheidung, die ich für den Rest meines Lebens getroffen habe, beeinflusst"", erklärte er.

Gerüchte bestätigt: Kanye hat ein Pornofilmstudio gegründet!,"Jetzt ist es wohl offiziell: Kanye West (46) hat ein Pornofilmstudio gegründet. Auf seinen Social-Media-Accounts veröffentlichte der Rapper ein sechs Sekunden langes Video, das das Datum des 24. April 2024 zeigt. Darunter stehen die Worte ""Yeezy Porn kommt"", wobei die Worte offensichtlich eine zweideutige Anspielung sein sollen. Bei seinen Fans kommt das neue Projekt jedoch gar nicht gut an. Unter dem Video auf YouTube kommentieren sie zu Tausenden. ""Ich glaube, er hat den Verstand verloren. Seine Kinder werden das irgendwann sehen und was dann?"" und ""Das könnte das Schlimmste sein, was er je getan hat, wenn er es durchzieht"", sind nur einige der Kommentare.
Kurz nachdem die Ankündigung online gegangen war, wurden Kanye und seine Partnerin Bianca Censori (29) auf dem Weg zu einem Date gesehen. Auf Fotos, die dem Mirror vorliegen, sieht das Paar trotz der Kritik ziemlich entspannt aus. Beide trugen komplett weiße Outfits. Die gebürtige Australierin griff wie gewohnt zu einem sehr knappen Ensemble. Auch auf X kursiert das neue Projekt des Yeezy-Designers schon. Einige Nutzer erinnern an Tweets des Rappers aus dem Jahr 2022, in denen der ""Flashing Lights""-Interpret noch eine sehr andere Ansicht zum Thema Pornos hatte. ""Pornos aller Art sollten von jeglichen Plattformen entfernt werden. Pornografie ist ein Produkt von Pädophilie. So etwas sollte verbannt werden"", schrieb er damals.
Yeezy als Marke gelangte eigentlich als Modekooperation zwischen Kanye und der Sportmarke Adidas zu Ruhm. Nach einigen antisemitischen Kommentaren des Musikers im Jahr 2022 beendete Adidas allerdings die Zusammenarbeit. Seitdem bringt Ye seine eigenen Designs heraus und veröffentlicht neben futuristischen Schuhen auch lässige Kleidung und Unterwäsche. Deshalb ist es für viele seiner Fans auch sehr überraschend, dass er im Namen seiner Marke nun in die Pornoindustrie einsteigen möchte.

Timeline of Their Feud,"Drake and Ye — formerly known as Kanye West — have just about seen it all throughout their decorated careers. The pair of rap titans have been friends, collaborators, mentors, enemies and more over the course of the last 15 years.
The 6 God once hailed Ye as the “most influential” person on his sound, and he’s gone on to live out his “Thank Me Now” lyrics of seeing his idols become rivals, as Drizzy and West are currently entrenched in a feud with no sign of reconciliation on the horizon.
After meeting in Hawaii, West took Drake under his wing and directed the music video to his So Far Gone breakout hit “Best I Ever Had” in 2009.
By the mid-2010s, they were working on a collab project that could’ve shifted the paradigm in hip-hop, but the rappers went their separate ways and have been sending shots in an on-and-off-again feud since.
It was thought that their beef was finally squashed for good in December 2021 when J. Prince helped broker a truce for Drake and Ye to reunite on stage at the Free Larry Hoover Benefit concert in Los Angeles.
However, their relationship eventually went awry again. In April 2024, West threw his hat into the ring to enter the rap civil war, going against Drake when hopping on a remix to Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar’s Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Like That.”

"Kanye West quer abrir produtora de filmes pornográficos, diz site","SÃO PAULO, SP (FOLHAPRESS)
O rapper Kanye West, 46, parece ter um novo rumo profissional eu sua vida. Segundo o site Page Six, ele deverá abrir um estúdio para produzir conteúdo pornográfico em breve.
Conforme a publicação, a produtora receberia o nome de Yezzy Porn. West já teria entrado em contato com um produtor poderoso desse universo para que ele fique à frente do projeto.
Curiosamente, em 2022, após o fim do casamento com Kim Kardashian, 43, o rapper revelou vício em pornografia e que isso teria sido um dos motivos para o rompimento do romance.
“Eu lido com o vício. O Instagram promove isso. Não deixarei isso acontecer com Northy e Chicago”, escreveu o músico sobre suas filhas.
No mesmo desabafo, ele ainda criticou Hollywood. “Hollywood é um gigante bordel e a pornografia destruiu minha família”, disse.",2024-04-24T19:37:41Z,https://jornaldebrasilia.com.br,Jornal de Brasília
5 Major Highlights From Kanye West's Interview With Justin LaBoy,"Kanye West’s quickly become a talking point in the last few days after coming for Drake on the blood-pumping “Like That Remix.” The rap icon recently sat with Justin LaBoy for a pumped-up, inaugural episode of The Download. On the show, Ye, in true fashion, let out more than a couple of bombshells. Altogether, the interview was marked by a few outlandish moments and comments that only someone like Ye could be behind.
For example, he tagged Kai Cenat an industry plant for criticizing the sizing of Yeezy's latest drop but that’s probably the least bizarre Kanye West comment in the entire The Download episode. He also labeled Chris Brown a “God,” insisted homophobic jokes have less impact today, and even declared Michelle Obama as the woman he’d have a threesome with. Overall, the entire episode was Kanye being Kanye, and the following moments are the most noteworthy.

5. Ye Comes For J. Cole
Ye and J. Cole were not necessarily feuding in the past, but it’s pretty obvious that Kanye West isn’t a fan. As soon as Justin LaBoy brought up Cole’s polarizing apology to K. Dot, Ye swiftly interjected. “F*ck all that p*ssy shit!” he said. Considering Ye and Drake’s ongoing beef, it’s clear to see why the former felt that Cole going on tour with Drake was him picking sides.
However, Kanye’s later comments allow us to trace the hostility back to 2016. Specifically, back to Cole’s track “False Prophets,” which is widely believed to be about West and his mental health issues over the years. Some of Ye’s digs at Cole on the episode include: “n*gga you can’t run now,” “you can’t say UP and Cole in the same sentence,” and finally, “I don’t even listen to J. Cole.”
4. Ye’s Favorite Rappers At The Moment
Kanye West also took the time out to share his love for his younger players in the rap game. When asked by Justin LaBoy who his favorite rappers are at the moment, Ye shared that the lineup keeps changing. However, he mentioned that 21 Savage and Kodak Black are doing it for him at the moment. He also mentioned the rising star Young Moose and spoke very highly of Playboi Carti and his career trajectory.
3. Kanye Vs. Drake
Scattered through the episode of The Download is Kanye West’s obvious disdain for all things Drake. He spoke about feeling “energized” to eliminate Drake. However, Ye said it was much more than that. “I’m tired of this n*gga fucking with me and all that shit,” he said. “It’s not just about the elimination of Drake, we’re gonna tear the head off whoever they got that they thought was in control.”
2. Ye Debuts The “Like That Remix”
One of the most important moments on Kanye West’s episode of The Download was obviously the premiere of the “Like That Remix.” The track’s opener featured a raging Ye, who declared he was backing Kendrick Lamar up in the ongoing rap beef. “You know we had to get The Hooligans up here / We gone take this p*ssy n*gga out / Yo, Dot, I got you.” As fans continue to clamor for Kendrick’s response to Drake’s disses, Ye is the latest fighter to step into the ring.

Taking the cake of all the interesting Kanye West moments on The Download is the Vultures 2 release date announcement. After the overwhelming success of Vultures 1, Ye teased the second part, and fans have been hoping for the news of the second installment. Finally, Ye has an answer. When asked by Justin LaBoy about when the album would be released, Ye simply replied, “it’s coming out May 3rd.” Evidently, the fans now have something to look forward to.

Kanye West, el rapero conocido por temas como “Praise God” y demás éxitos, está explorando nuevas fronteras más allá de su música y moda al contemplar la creación de un estudio de contenido para adultos, etiquetado tentativamente como Yeezy Porn. Según informaciones divulgadas por Page Six y TMZ, el artista habría estado deliberando esta idea desde hace algún tiempo y parece estar decidido a llevarla a cabo.
Para avanzar con el proyecto, West ha iniciado conversaciones con Mike Moz, quien es el exesposo de la actriz de películas pornográficas Stormy Daniels y también productor dentro de la industria. Según los reportes, West estaría aspirando a que Moz encabece la iniciativa.
A pesar de criticar anteriormente las repercusiones negativas de la pornografía en su matrimonio, Kanye muestra interés en este sector. (Créditos: Bellocqimages/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)
Este giro en la carrera de Kanye podría sorprender a muchos, especialmente considerando sus declaraciones previas sobre cómo el consumo de pornografía afectó negativamente su matrimonio con la estrella de reality Kim Kardashian, con quien tiene cuatro hijos: North, Saint, Chicago y Psalm.
En septiembre de 2022, West expresó a través de Instagram cómo consideraba que la pornografía había destruido su familia y criticó a plataformas como Instagram por promover dicho contenido. Adicionalmente, en octubre del mismo año, compartió un video donde mostraba material pornográfico a ejecutivos de Adidas durante una reunión.

“Hollywood es un burdel gigante. La pornografía destruyó a mi familia”, escribió en Instagram en septiembre de 2022. “Yo lidio con la adicción e Instagram la promueve”, denunció el artista musical en aquella ocasión. Asimismo, al margen de sus planes profesionales, West también ha llamado la atención recientemente por su comportamiento contradictorio respecto a la sexualización en los medios y su vida personal.
A pesar de haber criticado públicamente la representación sexualizada de Kardashian en anuncios y redes sociales, ha mostrado una actitud más permisiva hacia su nueva esposa, Bianca Censori, publicando fotos sugerentes de ella y defendiéndose agresivamente de las acusaciones de doble moral. Este cambio de postura ha sido evidente tras su matrimonio secreto con Censori en diciembre de 2022.

Kanye West en medio de acusaciones y polémica
Kanye también se encuentra en el centro de una controversia legal a raíz de una denuncia presentada por Trevor Phillips, un ex empleado de la Academia Donda, fundada por West en 2022. Phillips alega discriminación racial, antisemitismo, y conductas homofóbicas perpetradas por West.
En el texto de la demanda, se detallan incidentes específicos como el maltrato diferencial hacia empleados negros, la exposición de estudiantes y personal a discursos llenos de odio y alabanzas a figuras como Hitler, junto con amenazas dirigidas a la comunidad LGBTQ+. Además, se relata que West habría intimidado físicamente a Phillips frente a testigos.

En otro evento separado, West se vio involucrado en un altercado físico tras reportarse un incidente de acoso sexual hacia su esposa, Bianca Censori. Representantes de West describieron el acto como una agresión física y sexual, después de que un hombre no identificado realizara tocamientos indebidos hacia Censori. El episodio está siendo investigado por el Departamento de Policía de Los Ángeles.
Las acciones recientes de West agregan puntos a una larga lista de controversias y acusaciones que han marcado su carrera y vida personal en los últimos años. Los diversos incidentes van desde agresiones anteriores hasta el escrutinio público por sus relaciones personales, incluido su matrimonio con Censori y su reciente producción musical.

Incidentes adicionales de conducta pública, como la aparición de Censori en Disneyland descalza, han contribuido a la controversia alrededor de West y sus cercanos.

Kanye West in talks to launch Yeezy Porn with Stormy Daniels' ex,"The rapper formerly known as Kanye West is reportedly in talks to launch Yeezy Porn, a pornography division under the umbrella of his Yeezy company.
A rep for the controversial Grammy winner told TMZ that he’s long been mulling over such a venture, which would include both a Yeezy Porn studio and brand — for which he and partners are now in advanced discussions.
West, who now legally goes by Ye, has been consulting with Stormy Daniels’ ex-husband Michael “Mike Moz” Mosny, who’s both an actor and producer in the porn industry.
Yeezy Porn, if that will be the name, could debut as soon as this summer, according to TMZ.
Back in 2019, West told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe that he’d previously contended with a “full-on pornography addiction,” that he said has “affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life.”
West at the time also opened up about sex addiction.
Many headlines concerning Ye of late have been in relation to another way he’s shared risqué content, with explicit snaps of wife Bianca Censori.
When the Yeezy architectural designer, 29, is seen, she’s often in scantily clad outfits alongside her husband or on his social media accounts — a pattern that’s elicited concern from West’s followers. While some fans have defended the looks as likely playing into the couple’s mutual “kink,” many have called out West for exploiting Censori.
“Gurl, blink if you need help,” a commenter said on one such post earlier this year.
Another declared that such images of Censori gave them the “creeps.”",2024-04-24T19:14:01Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News
Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign's 'Vultures 2' to Posthumously Feature Takeoff,"Kanye, aka Ye, and Ty Dolla $ign have confirmed May 3 as the new release date for “Vultures 2,” the sequel to their Billboard 200-topping album. The album, originally slated for a March 8 release, will include the pre-existing “Let Me Chill Out,” a single featuring Rich the Kid and NBA Youngboy and the late Migos member Takeoff.
Kanye revealed the “Vultures 2” release date news during a recent appearance on Justin LaBoy’s “The Download” podcast. “Vultures” was announced as a three-part album series with the third volume said to arrive on April 5 though the third volume of the album was not discussed during Kanye and LaBoy’s conversation.
Not soon after, Rolling Stone confirmed the inclusion of “Let Me Chill Out” and Takeoff’s verse on the album, describing it as a “highlight track.” Takeoff, who was shot and killed in 2022, has been only ever been posthumously featured on songs for Quavo’s 2023 album “Rocket Power.”
Popular on Variety
Kanye and Ty Dolla released “Vultures 1” on Feb. 10 via YZY, which debuted atop the Billboard 200, launching its lead single, “Carnival” to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song competed with fresh singles from Beyoncé, and remains at No. 20 on the chart.
There have been more than a few broken promises when it comes to “Vultures” (including the pair’s disappointing Rolling Loud set). Kanye and Ty Dolla supported the album with various “listening sessions” that were supposed to hit arenas (in Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Pittsburgh, Nashville, Charlotte and Washington, D.C), but those shows were scrapped within a day or two of first being announced.
Kanye has also spoken about possibly releasing the second part of the record solely as a paid download, or through a new and exclusive streaming site, rather than a conventional rollout to DSPs, but only time will tell what “Vultures 2” will actually bring.",2024-04-24T18:55:54Z,https://variety.com,Variety
Kanye West möchte im Porno-Business durchstarten,"Offenbar plant der Rapper den Einstieg in die Pornoindustrie. Dies will er zusammen mit dem Ex-Partner von Pornostar Stormy Daniels machen.
Darum gehts Der Musiker und Unternehmer Kanye West alias Ye hat offenbar einen neuen Business-Plan.
Wie das US-amerikanische Newsportal «TMZ» berichtet, soll der Rapper einen Fuss in die Pornoindustrie setzen wollen.
Unterstützen soll ihn der Ex-Mann von Pornostar Stormy Daniels.
Musik, Mode und jetzt Pornos – Kanye West (46) scheint eine neue Business-Idee zu haben. Wie das US-amerikanische Nachrichtenportal «TMZ» berichtet, soll West alias Ye nun in der Pornoindustrie durchstarten. Unterstützung erhält der Musiker von Mike Moz, dem Ex-Mann von Pornostar Stormy Daniels (45). Moz ist seit mehreren Jahren als Produzent in der Branche tätig.
Kanye West soll offenbar schon länger darüber nachdenken, in die Pornoindustrie einzusteigen, wie die Quelle gegenüber dem amerikanischen Portal erzählt. Die Pläne sollen nun konkretisiert werden. Der Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian (43) will mit seiner Marke «Yeezy» ein Pornostudio aufbauen. Mike Moz soll als Leiter des neuen Business fungieren. Das Projekt starte bereits im Sommer, so «TMZ» weiter.
Ye ist pornosüchtig
Überraschen mag dieser neue Business-Plan von Ye aber nicht. Kanye hat in den letzten Jahren immer wieder offen über seine Vorliebe für Pornografie und seine sexuelle Fantasie gesprochen – und auch in seinen Songs verarbeitet.
Als sich der 46-Jährige von Kim Kardashian trennte, gab er zu, dass Pornos die Ehe zerstört hätten. «Hollywood ist ein riesiges Bordell und Pornografie hat meine Familie zerstört», teilte er im September 2022 auf Instagram. «Ich beschäftige mich mit der Sucht und Instagram fördert sie.»
Das Ausmass seiner Pornosucht wurde dann einen Monat nach dem Instagrampost klar: Der Rapper soll Führungskräften der Marke Adidas einen Porno bei einem Geschäftstreffen gezeigt haben. Nach diesem Vorfall hat der Konzern die Zusammenarbeit mit Kanye West mit sofortiger Wirkung beendet. West soll die Pornosucht aber durch seinen Glauben überwunden haben. Es sei «nicht gut für seinen Geist», erklärte er. Dennoch will er jetzt in genau dieser Industrie durchstarten.
Was hältst du von Kanye West? Seine Musik finde ich cool. Er war mal toll, wird aber immer verrückter. Ist mir total unsympathisch. Kenne ich nicht.",2024-04-24T18:36:36Z,https://www.20min.ch,20 Minuten

Ye Announces New ‘Vultures 2’ Release Date With Ty Dolla $ign,"Ye — formerly known as Kanye West — has confirmed a new tentative release date for Vultures 2, the sequel to his and Ty Dolla $ign’s collaborative album.
Ye has been one to change his mind with the wind when it comes to release dates, but West revealed on Justin LaBoy’s The Download podcast that Vultures 2 is slated to arrive on May 3. It had originally been slated for March 8.

“It’s coming out May 3, yeah,” Ye declared. May 3 has long been the rumored release date even going back to March when West’s DMs were accidentally leaked with a Baby Keem fan page while Ye thought he was messaging the real artist Baby Keem.
Trending on Billboard
West will face stiff competition to earn another No. 1 album this time around on the Billboard 200. Dua Lipa’s Radical Optimism is scheduled to land on May 3, and Taylor Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department most likely isn’t going anywhere either.
Ye and Ty Dolla independently released Vultures 1 on Feb. 10 via YZY, which debuted atop the Billboard 200 with 148,000 album-equivalent units sold in the first week.
With the No. 1, Ye earned his 11th leader and Ty solidified his first. The project — Ye’s first since his string of antisemitic remarks and controversies — also spawned the No. 1 Hot 100 hit “Carnival” featuring Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti.
Yeezy had been laying low on the music front in recent weeks, but returned with a splash while hopping on an unofficial remix to Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar’s “Like That.” The explosive remix — which finds Ye taking shots and J. Cole and Drake — isn’t on streaming services, but was re-uploaded to Ye’s YouTube page on Wednesday (April 24).
Elsewhere in his chat with LaBoy, West revealed that the “elimination” of Drake inspired him to hop on the remix. “[Future] called me and I went to the studio and laid that. We went through the creative process of adding the chords and called the Hooligans out in London to get on the joint,” he explained. “Everybody was very, very energized about the elimination of Drake.”

When Kim Kardashian Was Certain That Kanye West Was 'Having Another Episode' During Their Divorce,"After six years of marriage and months of rumors about an approaching separation, the founder of SKIMS, Kim Kardashian, filed for divorce from Kanye West, the rapper, in February 2021. At the same time, as reported by ET Online, an insider confirmed that Ye's behavior left Kim worried about him. She thought he was ""having another episode"" of his bipolar disease.

The source informed the outlet, ""Kim sees this as Kanye having another episode, and it is concerning to her, especially concerning their kids. Kim is just taking the time to focus on herself and her family and continuing to work and grow her business."" Kim highlighted ""irreconcilable differences"" in her divorce petition, in which she also requested shared and legal custody of the couple's four children under the terms of a prenuptial agreement.
Another source also informed the outlet at the time, ""The divorce has been difficult for him, but knowing that he has access to his little ones and has split custody is making the transition easier. Kim and Kanye are in contact with regards to their kids. Kanye has hope that they will reconcile, but he is not expecting that in the immediate future. The kids are doing great, and the older ones have had time to process and understand the situation.""

During that time, the source also said Kim was ""happy to see that chapter close."" The insider further added, ""She knows that it is what is healthiest for her and her family, and she is ready to put this hardship behind her both publicly and personally. Kim has had her moments of feeling overwhelmed as a mom, of course, but the fact that her family has been so unified and supported her through this difficult time has made things so much easier for her to process. Kim has also made it a point to keep herself busy. She is not interested in dating right now and is focused on her family and healing the situation.""

In a quite recent episode of The Kardashians, Kim revealed that her ex-husband doesn't have any security or nannies in his modest house. Kim spoke up to her sister Kourtney about North's father. North West reportedly preferred staying at Kanye's home to her own. As reported by Page Six, Kim confessed in the episode, ""North will go to her dad's; she'll be like dad's is the best he has it all. He has it all figured out. He doesn't have a nanny, he doesn't have a chef, and he doesn't have security. He lives in an apartment, and she'll start crying 'Why don't you have an apartment? I can't believe we don't have an apartment.""
Kourtney said that her three children, Mason, Penelope, and Reign, all prefer spending time with Scott Disick. She said, ""They do that at Scott's too. They're like 'Dad has the best house. Your house sucks. He has the best house. It's not super big. The vibes better.""

"Kanye West Ripped Apart Online Following ""Yeezy P*rn"" Reports","Kanye West is someone who has been known to engage in numerous different ventures. However, not every single venture has worked out for him. One could look at something like Donda Academy to understand exactly what we mean by that. Overall, one thing that Ye likes to do is add ""Yeezy"" to various different copyright filings. That way, he can use the name on a myriad of trademarks and products. According to a recent report from TMZ, Ye has even been working on some sort of Yeezy Porn venture, in which he would create a studio that makes adult films.
As you can imagine, this came as a bit of a shock to his fans. After all, Ye has become a reformed Christian of sorts over the last few years. Furthermore, he has been adamant about his porn addiction and how ungodly it is. With that in mind, the latest update from Kanye comes across as hypocritical. So much so that his fans were out in droves on Twitter yeserday, where they revealed just how upset they were over this new venture.

Kanye West New Venture
As you can see below, the consensus amongst Ye fans is that this is absolutely horrible. In fact, it feels like more Ye fans are upset about this than they were his anti-semitic ramblings. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that his actions in 2022 ushered in a new fanbase, that doesn't even really know about Ye's past beyond The Life Of Pablo. It's a sad fact to consider given all Ye accomplished over the last few decades. Regardless, it would appear as though the Yeezy Porn venture is alienating his newer fans, which could be bad for business as Vultures 2 drops on May 3rd.

Kanye West Reveals Details of 'Assault' on Wife Bianca Censori by Unknown Man,"A representative of Kanye West recently spoke about the incident involving his wife, Bianca Censori, and how she was 'physically assaulted,' not 'grabbed.' TMZ reported last week that an unknown man allegedly grabbed the Yeezy architect by her waist and slid his hands inside her clothes, which left her horrified. Now, Ye is revealing details of the unfortunate incident, including his own reaction.

On April 23, 2024, the Yeezy designer appeared on an episode of The Download podcast hosted by Jalal Alkali. The curious host began by telling Ye he saw pictures of him and his wife at Disneyland. However, the next moment, a news flash reported that Censori was assaulted. Alkali said, ""We see reports of a battery charge as a result of your wife being sexually assaulted,"" asking Ye if the Australian was ok and requesting him to give his fans a live account of the disgraceful act that unfolded despite the presence of his security team at the scene.
The rapper recalled, ""My wife is walking to the bathroom at the chateau, and then this guy..."" when Alkali interjected to confirm if the incident took place at Disneyland because most people have this presumption. However, Ye refused, citing that the location specifications were irrelevant to the actual incident. ""Let's not kill the magic,"" he said, continuing to narrate, ""This guy just grabbed my wife and then she just - I didn't see it directly - and she started just explaining to me what happened. So then I walked over and found him."" Subsequently, the controversial rapper gathered the security of the whole area, including his own, to escort the accused from the premises.
The Praise God rapper then confronted the man about what happened while he told Ye, ""It's okay, It's okay,"" but West disagreed. ""Then he saw it wasn't okay, he went to bed early - tuck this n***a in..."" Meanwhile the host and the musician burst out laughing when Ye added, ""I don't know what happened, he had to go to bed early.""

The news first surfaced on April 18 when Ye was named a suspect in a battery case by the Los Angeles Police Department. The 46-year-old's representative told The Sun, ""'Grabbed' is a grossly inadequate description of what happened,"" and detailed the gruesome details of the assault. ""He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted,"" explained the rep. Afterward, the couple left the place, and since then, the situation has been further investigated while Ye has been free of any charges.

Kanye West In Talks To Roll Out Porn Studio; Internet Thinks The Musician Is Broke,"> Culture
Remember this (now deleted tweet).
The Donda rapper in 2022, during his ‘Christian’ era, slammed porn calling Hollywood a giant brothel. He also lamented how pornography destroyed his family. In 2019, West stated that he was exposed to the vices of porn when he was barely five and spiraled into sex addiction soon after his mom’s demise in 2007. He blamed Playboy as the gateway to his full blown porn addiction that his dad had left out when he was five. He claimed that G-d helped him overcome the addiction. West grew a huge religious fanbase with his ‘Jesus Is King’ album and the Sunday services, one of which even featured Marilyn Manson and Justin Bieber. And now the former anti-porn crusader is allegedly planning to open an adult entertainment studio, Yeezy Porn! According to TMZ, a Yeezy representative revealed that Ye is “dead set on doing it.” Per sources, Kanye is in talks with Stormy Daniel’s ex-husband, Mike Moz, a former producer in the adult industry.
https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/1783020595963125964
Reactions poured in, with many slamming the former billionaire rapper. Users asked, “Wait, what happened to Sunday service?” and “So his Christian grift is over?” Few jibed, “So what happened to Reverend Ye? He didn't become the next Joel Olsteen so now he's going in the total opposite direction?” One user quipped, “So I guess the Christianity thing isn't paying off anymore so now he's jumping to something new to pay the bills.” Many think the musician is broke now, ""Oh, the money is running LOW.” “Bro is BROKE,” wrote one. Meanwhile, one user suggested, “He better be starring,” in the Yeezy porn features.

Recently, Kanye West was on a podcast with Justin Laboy. During this podcast, Ye spoke up about Vultures 2 and how he and Ty have been working extremely hard on it. Although he didn't give too much insight into the tracks and features on the album, he did give us a date. According to the clip below, Ye and Ty will be dropping their new album on May 3rd. That means the project is coming out in about 10 days, and it will fall on a Friday, like most releases do.

This date has previously been given, although it was not a date that had been confirmed by Kanye himself. Now, it appears as though fans have something truly tangible to go off of. Whether or not this actually works out for everyone, still remains to be seen. After all, Ye does have a long history of delaying projects and missing out on release promises. Hopefully, this time around, we actually get the album at midnight.

Kanye West Slammed Online for ‘Sick’ Comments on Bianca Censori and Michelle Obama,"Netizens online have declared Kanye West as 'sick' in response to his egregiously disrespectful remarks on his wife Bianca Censori and former First Lady, Michelle Obama. During a recent interview on The Download Show, the Vultures 1 musician made the startling statements. Host Justin Laboy, questioned West, 46, about who he and Censori, 29, would like to be in a 'threesome' with. According to The Sun, Laboy insisted, ""You can pick anyone in the world...Just one person."" As the Can't Tell Me Nothing artist contemplated his reply, the podcaster commented, ""I think I know what you're thinking but I'm not even gonna say no names. I just want to see what you would think.""

To Laboy's astonishment, Ye nonchalantly answered, ""Michelle Obama."" The podcast host burst out laughing, while West added, ""Gotta f**k the president's wife"" in a sing-songy voice, cackling along. Netizens online, however, did not find the comment funny, with many bashing the rapper for what they thought was a distasteful answer. On X, formerly Twitter, a spectator tweeted the footage of West's statement and wrote, ""Bro is sick.""

""Bruh what's wrong with this man,"" a second user commented on X. ""What the hell is wrong with Kanye West lmfaoooo Obama gonna be mad asf when he sees this,"" chimed another. A third user slammed, ""I’m a Kanye West fan but This isn't funny. It's highly disgraceful, inappropriate, and disrespectful…"" Echoing similar sentiments, another user added, ""This man popped out of nowhere with a Drake and Cole diss and now he’s talking about 3somes with Michele.""

Another comment read, ""He’s that kid in class that keeps on arguing with the teacher and the rest of the class is like 'Okay, here we go again.'"" Netizens also alluded that West may be mentally incapacitated. One user remarked, ""Wow. Lock him up in a psychiatric facility."" Reiterating the sentiment, another user added, ""Did you forget where to pick up your medication, it’s either CVS or Walgreens,"" while another user online, asserted that outlets should, ""stop giving this man a platform to speak...""

While the Obamas have yet to comment on West's recent remarks, the history of verbal tirades between West and the Obamas runs long, according to The Mirror. The Carnival rapper once publicly objected to Barack Obama referring to him as a jacka** following his on-stage meltdown during Taylor Swift's 2009 VMA victory speech. ""He is jack*** but he is talented,"" Barack went on to say in a 2012 interview with The Atlantic. In an apparent reference to West, Michelle also advised voters not to ""play games with candidates who have no chance of winning"" as she spoke to the Democratic National Convention during the 2020 US Presidential election contest.",2024-04-24T11:00:17Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Kanye West planea lanzar su propio estudio de cine para adultos,"La obsesión de Kanye West con el cine porno es algo de sobra sabido por varias fuentes: en una de sus últimas denuncias un exempleado recordaba cómo presumió de sus masturbaciones y de las fotos íntimas de una amiga; a otros trabajadores les mostró vídeos caseros con Kim Kardashian; e incluso utilizó una escena de una película para adultos en una reunión con directivos de Adidas como venganza por el fin de su acuerdo.
Por ello, las últimas informaciones que ha conseguido el canal de noticias TMZ no son tan sorprendentes ni descabelladas, sino un paso casi lógico en su carrera empresarial, después de que él mismo autodestruyese su imperio a través de comentarios antisemitas, racistas y misóginos, peleas callejeras y un largo etcétera.
Kanye West quiere convertirse en un magnate de la pornografía. Tal y como ha afirmado al citado medio uno de sus representantes, Ye le lleva tiempo dando vueltas a la idea de sacar su propio estudio de cine para adultos y nunca antes había estado tan cerca de realizarlo, pues las conversaciones con sus socios para ponerlo en marcha están más que avanzadas.
Agregan desde TMZ que Kanye, de 46 años, ha estado hablando cada vez más de construir su propio set de rodaje de Yeezy Porn —el nombre no es seguro—, el cual sería solo una parte de una división muy amplia de entretenimiento para adultos de su empresa matriz, Yeezy, por lo que no se pueden descartar juguetes sexuales, página web y otros posibles ingresos.
Unos de los socios con los que pondría en marcha el negocio sería Mike Moz, exmarido de la exestrella porno Stormy Daniels —quien ahora está en el centro de la noticia del juicio a Donald Trump—, y todo un veterano de la industria, con más de una década como productor a sus espaldas, a quien Ye querría para ser el jefe de esta nueva ala de su empresa Yeezy.
El representante del rapero, de hecho, cree que no habrá que esperar demasiado para que este viejo sueño de Kanye se vuelva realidad —si bien hubo una época en la que decía que el porno era malo para el espíritu cristiano, luego aceptó ser adicto al mismo— e incluso cree que este mismo verano podrían dar el pistoletazo de salida.",2024-04-24T09:13:38Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos
Kanye West rêve d'un plan à trois avec Michelle Obama et son épouse Bianca Censori,"Précedent Suivant
L’enfant terrible du rap américain fait une fois de plus la Une des médias people avec des déclarations chocs. Kanye West a fait eu des propos qui ont enflammé le monde du hip-hop. Sans aucune retenue, le rappeur américain a exprimé son souhait de faire un plan à trois avec sa nouvelle femme Bianca Censori et l’ex-première dame des États-Unis, Michelle Obama. Tel un sniper, Kanye West n’a pas mâché ses mots en répondant à l’interview pour le podcast de l’influenceur Justin Laboy. Coup de bluff ou coup de pub, en tout cas, son fantasme a fait le tour de la Toile. Tout le monde en parle déjà.
Entre Kanye West et les Obama, la guerre est-elle déclarée ?
Ce n’est pas la première fois que le clash est proche entre le nouvel amoureux de Bianca Censori et la famille Obama. En effet, l’ancien résident de la Maison-Blanche a traité d’idiot Kanye West lors des MTV Video Music Awards en 2009. De plus, le rappeur qui défraye sans cesse la chronique a interrompu le discours de remerciement de Taylor Swift. Barack Obama n’a pas du tout apprécié son comportement et il n’a pas hésité à le faire savoir. D’autre part, de son côté, Kanye West a exprimé haut et fort son regret d’avoir soutenu l’ex-président américain au début de sa campagne de 2008. La star n’a pas aimé qu’on l’utilise par la suite, selon ses propres dires.

Le fantasme de la star du hip-hop enflamme la Toile
Habitué aux polémiques, Kanye West joue sans cesse avec le fe u. C’est sa marque de fabrique. Toutefois, l’apprenti pyromane risque de se brûler gravement cette fois-ci. Après avoir exprimé, sans aucun filtre, son désir de plan à trois avec l’épouse de Barack Obama, les internautes n’ont pas pu résister à faire part de leur opinion. « Oh là là, Kanye West ne manque pas d’audace ! C’est surprenant ! », peut-on lire sur X. Étant donné les réactions des gens, on peut penser que cela sent le roussi pour lui. Les internautes se sont déchaînés sur les réseaux sociaux. C’était la remarque de trop pour la plupart des followers.
Coup de pub ou provocation, Kanye West joue avec le feu
Ces derniers temps, son existence n’a pas été de tout repos. Sa vie privée est scrutée dans les moindres détails. Être un personnage public, c’est subir une attention médiatique constante. Récemment, son nouvel amour, Bianca Censori, a essuyé de nombreuses critiques au sujet de sa tenue jugée provocatrice lors d’une apparition avec son compagnon. De ce fait, le dérapage de la star à propos de son rêve érotique et torride ne serait-il pas juste un plan marketing de plus, ou est-ce une réelle provocation dont il a coutume ? Peut-être que Kanye West aurait dû garder sa langue dans sa poche pour éviter un scandale qui peut lui être fatal. Affaire à suivre…",2024-04-24T05:19:58Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
Kanye West Announces Plans For Yeezy Adult Entertainment Studio,"Few pop culture events are more chaotic than a Kanye West press tour. The rapper manages to shock fans every time he gives an interview, and this week has been no different. West told TMZ on Tuesday that he plans to start a brand new pornography studio under his Yeezy banner. This has been a long time coming, according to the outlet. West plans to launch the porn studio as early as this summer, with the help of industry veteran Mike Moz.
A representative for Kanye West claimed he's entertained the notion of getting into porn for several years. The difference maker, it seems, is the connection with the aforementioned Moz. As a former boyfriend of Stormy Daniels, Moz reportedly has the experience and the knowledge to make a porn studio successful. At least, in the rapper's estimation. TMZ reported that the Yeezy porn studio would kick off a ""broader adult entertainment division"" with Yeezy as the parent company. West has not yet commented on the business plan in a public capacity.

Kanye West Claims Pornography Ruined His Life
PARIS, FRANCE - (Photo by Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)
Kanye West has a contentious history with pornography. He served as the official creative director of the 2018 Pornhub Awards, and performed his single ""I Love It"" at the ceremony. The rapper has also claimed to have a porn addiction that threatened his relationship with his ex-wife and his children. In 2022, he got on Instagram to criticize social media for making porn more accessible than ever. ""Hollywood is a giant brothel Pornography destroyed my family I deal with the addiction,"" he claimed. ""Instagram promotes it Not gonna let it happen to Northy and Chicago,” he continued.
West is singing a completely different tune in 2024, which is something fans should be well accustomed to. The rapper famously cycles through different eras and belief systems in his life and music, only to change things up shortly after. Historically, West has announced business plans that have yet to come to fruition, so time will tell if Yeezy's adult entertainment studio actually happens. Until it does, it's yet another bizarre chapter in the Kanye West saga.

"Kanye West Disses Drake On ""Like That Remix"": A Break Down Of Lyrics","If you thought Drake and Kanye West had forgotten their long-standing beef, think again. Ye recently came out guns a-blazing with the release of the “Like That Remix,” proving that he and Drizzy have a long way to go before they settle. From the first line of the diss track, it’s evident that Ye has a bone to pick. Alongside Future, Metro Boomin’, and Ty Dolla $ign, this remix borrows many elements from the original track and takes things up a notch. Altogether, 2024 has quickly become the year of the diss track, and the Drake-Kanye West beef is the latest entry in the long lineup.
Drake Vs. The World
Kanye West and Drake’s beef stretches back years, and the remix is the most recent milestone. However, while Ye is pretty used to commandeering multiple spats simultaneously, this is seemingly new territory for Drizzy. In what can only be considered a humongous feat, Drake has had words for several heavyweights in the game this year alone. Between Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross, and now Ye, it’s a miracle he’s still standing.
As Drake continues to prove he’s no pushover, the industry is foaming at the mouth in anticipation of what’s to come. But what’s most remarkable is that two of his diss tracks, “Push Ups” and the controversial, AI-assisted “Taylor Made Freestyle,” are targeted at Kendrick. This is why Ye’s involvement caught us all by surprise. Kanye West debuted the “Like That Remix” during his appearance on The Download with Justin Laboy, and this has effectively added a new layer to his ongoing beef with Drake.
Ye Felt “Energized” To Eliminate Drake
Much to the disappointment of fans, Kendrick Lamar has yet to respond to Drake for the aforementioned diss tracks. Nonetheless, Ye seems to have taken on the task, claiming the baton off K-Dot. It’s no wonder the track begins the way he does. In an aggressive manner, Ye hollers: ""You know we had to get The Hooligans up here / We gon’ take this p*ssy n*gga out / Yo, Dot, I got you.""
Right out the gate, Kanye’s made his intentions clear… he’s out for blood. While on The Download, he shared that he was “energized” to take down Drake. “[Future] called me and I went to the studio and laid that,” he began. “We went through the creative process of adding the chords and called the Hooligans out in London to get on the joint... Everybody was very, very energized about the elimination of Drake.”
Multiple Stray Bullets

In true Ye fashion, shots were fired at not just Drake but those within his proximity. Drake famously resigned with Universal Music Group in 2022, reportedly featuring some serious money being thrown around. UMG’s CEO, Lucian Grainge, was one of the names dropped on the “Like That Remix.” Specifically, Ye referred to him as Drake’s “master.”
""Where’s Lucian? Serve your master, n*gga / You caught a little bag for your masters, didn’t ya / Lifetime deal, I feel bad for n*ggas / Y’all so outta sight, outta mind/ I can’t even think of a Drake line.""
However, the most memorable stray bullet fell on J. Cole, who famously bowed out of the rap feud by apologizing to Kendrick Lamar. Nonetheless, Ye had some words for him. In what has become one of the most viral lines on the track, Kanye says, ""Play J. Cole, get the pu**y dry."" The reason for the animosity remains unclear, but fans have long since had their theories about why Kanye West and J. Cole do not see eye to eye.
For one, Ye might not have enjoyed Cole’s “big three” claim. However, Kendrick’s response about “big me” didn’t seem to rub Kanye the wrong way. In 2016, Cole’s “False Prophets” had a few lines that may have subtly pointed to Ye’s mental health issues. Whatever the case may be, Ye told Justin Laboy that it was too late for Cole to back out of the feud. Evidently, the damage is already done. ""It’s like, n**ga, you can’t run now,” Ye said.
Conclusion
Kanye West and Drake’s beef has now hit a new peak. It’s anyone’s guess if Ye will double down with another verse soon. Or maybe Drizzy has some words of his own in store. However, at the core of it all is Kendrick Lamar. Above all, the fans are still eager for his return.

Kanye West will wohl sein eigenes Pornofilmstudio gründen!,"Kanye West (46) hat offenbar große Pläne! Wie TMZ erfahren haben will, plant der Rapper anscheinend, einen Fuß in die Pornoindustrie zu setzen. Wie ein Vertreter des Musikers gegenüber dem Magazin berichtet, soll er schon eine Weile mit dem Gedanken spielen, sein eigenes Erwachsenenfilmstudio zu gründen – mittlerweile nehmen die Pläne wohl Gestalt an: Er soll bereits mit möglichen Partnern verhandeln. In den Gesprächen geht es angeblich darum, ein ganzes Yeezy-Porno-Studio aufzubauen, welches ein Teil einer breiteren Erwachsenenunterhaltung innerhalb der Yeezy-Muttergesellschaft werden soll. Unterstützung soll er von Mike Moz, dem Ex-Mann von Pornostar Stormy Daniels (45), erhalten, der bereits seit mehreren Jahrzehnten als Produzent in der Branche tätig ist.
Für Fans, die den Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian (43) schon länger verfolgen, mag diese Entwicklung nicht überraschend sein: Kanye machte bereits in der Vergangenheit immer wieder Schlagzeilen, weil er offen über seine sexuellen Fantasien und seine Vorliebe für Pornos gesprochen hat. Zudem rappte er mehrfach über Sexszenarien mit verschiedenen Frauen. Derzeit sorgen er und seine Ehefrau Bianca Censori (29) vor allem durch die freizügigen Outfits der Architektin für Aufsehen, die sie angeblich nur seinetwegen tragen soll.
Auch bei Geschäftstreffen seiner Marke soll Kanye durch unangemessenes Verhalten aufgefallen sein: Laut Gerichtsunterlagen, die Mirror vorliegen, hat sein früherer Mitarbeiter Trevor Phillips deshalb Klage eingereicht. Unter anderem soll der ""Runaway""-Interpret bei einer geschäftlichen Besprechung bezüglich seiner nicht akkreditierten Schule, der Donda Academy, bei der sie eigentlich den Lehrplan und Gartenbau planen wollten, stattdessen gesagt haben: ""Früher hatte ich jeden Tag Orgien, mindestens zwei bis drei Mädchen. Und jetzt kann ich mich nicht einmal mehr hinlegen, ohne mir einen runterzuholen."" Daraufhin soll Kanye so getan haben, als würde er masturbieren.

Είπε ότι θα έκανε τρίο με τη Michelle Obama,"Μία δήλωση που συζητήθηκε έκανε ο Kanye West, ο οποίος σε συνένευξή του αποκάλυψε ότι θα ήθελε να συνευρεθεί ερωτικά με την πρώην Πρώτη Κυρία των ΗΠΑ, Michelle Obama και τη σύζυγό του Bianca Censori.
Μετά τις αντισημιτικές δηλώσεις που ξεσήκωσαν θύελλα αντιδράσεων και τον έφεραν στο επίκεντρο σφοδρής κριτικής και άλλων κυρώσεων, ο Κάνιε Γουέστ (Kanye West) προχώρησε σε πιο “πιπεράτα” σχόλια με θέμα την ερωτική του ζωή.
Ο διάσημος ράπερ βρέθηκε καλεσμένος στο podcast “The Download” και μεταξύ άλλων ρωτήθηκε από τον παρουσιαστή της εκπομπής Justin Laboy με ποια διάσημη γυναίκα θα ήθελε να συνευρεθεί ερωτικά μαζί με τη σύζυγό του Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι (Bianca Censori).
Αφού το σκέφτηκε για λίγα δευτερόλεπτα απάντησε πως θα έκανε σεξ με την πρώην Πρώτη Κυρία, Michelle Obama. Στη συνέχεια ξέσπασε σε γέλια και πρόσθεσε: “Πρέπει να γ@@@@ω τη σύζυγο του προέδρου!”.
Ο ράπερ δεν εξήγησε περαιτέρω το σκεπτικό με τον παρουσιαστή να σχολιάζει: “Δεν νομίζω ότι αυτή είναι η νόμιμη απάντηση, αλλά αυτή είναι η απάντηση για σήμερα”.
Είναι άγνωστο αν ο West και η Censori – που ενώθηκαν με τα δεσμά του γάμου τον Δεκέμβριο του 2022 – έχουν ανοιχτό γάμο, ωστόσο είναι ανοιχτοί με τη σεξουαλικότητά τους.

Kanye West makes light of ongoing police investigation for battery,"Sources refuted Ye's claims of sexual and physical assault, calling them 'totally off base and inaccurate'
Kanye West is standing by his actions after he punched a man for allegedly “physically and sexually” assaulting his wife, Bianca Censori.
Last week, TMZ reported that the legendary rapper, 46, was named as a suspect for battery in an LAPD report after punching a man in retaliation during the couple’s visit to the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood, California.
As news of the altercation spread, Ye finally broke his silence on the matter on Tuesday’s episode of The Download podcast, firmly standing by his actions.
“He had to go to bed early. [I] tucked in this n**** in,” he said via Page Six as he burst into laughter.
The Runaway hitmaker then detailed the incident, which occurred after he left Bianca in the lobby to go to the restroom.
“I didn’t see it directly, and [Bianca] started just explaining to me what happened, so then I walked over and found him,” Ye recalled.
When the man played it off and insisted to security that “it’s OK,” Ye responded, “No, it’s not OK,” and clocked him in the face.
Previously, Ye’s reps responded to the initial police report, noting that the phrasing of Bianca’s assault as her only being “pushed or grabbed” was “a grossly inadequate description of what happened.”
They emphasised to TMZ, “The assailant didn’t merely collide into her,” and further detailed the “physical” and “sexual assault” that had occurred.
The man in question was identified as either one of twin brothers Mark and Jonnie Houston, who own multiple bars and restaurants across LA.

Η περίεργη σχέση του West με τον Οbama
Το 2009, ο West διέκοψε την Taylor Swift στη σκηνή των MTV Video Music Awards, όταν εκείνη παρέλαβε το βραβείο Moonman για το καλύτερο γυναικείο βίντεο. Ανεβαίνοντας στη σκηνή, ο West άρπαξε το μικρόφωνο και είπε: «Yo, Taylor, χαίρομαι πραγματικά για σένα, θα σε αφήσω να τελειώσεις. Αλλά η Beyoncé είχε ένα από τα καλύτερα βίντεο όλων των εποχών». Εκείνη την εποχή δέχτηκε έντονη κριτική για τις ενέργειές του από μουσικούς, διασημότητες και θαυμαστές, συμπεριλαμβανομένου του Obama.
Κατά τη διάρκεια ενός διαλείμματος στα γυρίσματα για μια συνέντευξη στο CNBC το 2009, ο Obama ακούστηκε να δηλώνει: «είναι ένας μαλάκας***"", αναφερόμενος στο περιστατικό. Το υλικό με τον Οbama να μιλάει για τον West διέρρευσε και στη συνέχεια έγινε viral.
Σε συνέντευξη που είχε παραχωρήσει στο People μερικά χρόνια αργότερα, ο πρώην Αμερικανός πρόεδρος ρωτήθηκε με ποιον θα προτιμούσε να κάνει παρέα: με τα μέλη της τηλεοπτικής εκπομπής Duck Dynasty (διάσημοι κυνηγοί πάπιας!) ή με τον West; Η απάντηση του Obama ήταν διπλωματική. Επέλεξε μεν τους κυνηγούς πάπιας («θα είχε πλάκα»), αλλά δεν παρέλειψε να προσθέσει πόσο εκτιμά το ταλέντο του West. «Η μουσική του είναι εκπληκτική! Εχω πολλά τραγούδια του στο iPad μου...».
To 2015 o Οbama συμβούλευσε τον West να προσέχει λίγο περισσότερο με τα... μηνύματά που στέλνει. «Δεν μπορείς να μιλάς για πράγματα όπως ''μία όμορφη, σκοτεινή, διεστραμμένη φαντασία''», είπε αναφερόμενος σε στίχο του ράπερ. «Υπάρχουν πολλοί που έχουν χάσει τη θέση τους στο Κογκρέσο λέγοντας τέτοια πράγματα», έλεγε με αφορμή τις πολιτικές προθέσεις του ράπερ.
Τον Μάιο του 2018, ο West συμμετείχε σε μια δίωρη συνέντευξη με τον ραδιοφωνικό παρουσιαστή Charlamagne tha God, όπου επέκρινε τον Οbama επειδή δεν του ζήτησε συγγνώμη αφού τον αποκάλεσε ""jack***"" το 2009.",2024-04-23T18:51:00Z,https://www.athensvoice.gr,Athens Voice Online

Kanye West revealed in a new interview he would have sex with former first lady Michelle Obama.
The “Heartless” rapper, 46, was asked on “The Download” podcast Tuesday with whom he’d want to have a “threesome” alongside his wife, Bianca Censori.
“Michelle Obama,” West responded after contemplating for a few moments. He then burst into laughter and added, “Gotta f–k the president’s wife.”

The Yeezy founder did not explain the reasoning behind his choice, and host Justin Laboy speculated, “I don’t think that’s the legit answer, but that’s the answer for today.”
It’s unknown whether West and Censori — who tied the knot in December 2022 — have an open marriage.
However, the two are clearly very open with their sexuality. The Australian architect is often seen out in public wearing revealing outfits and the pair was once caught in a NSFW moment while on a boat in Italy.

Page Six reached out to Obama’s rep for comment on West’s remarks but did not immediately hear back.
It’s also unclear why the “Power” rapper chose the “Light We Carry” author, 60, and whether it was meant to slight her husband, Barack Obama, given the mens’ tumultuous history.
In 2009, after West infamous interrupted Taylor Swift onstage at the MTV Video Music Awards, the then-president called the “Jesus Walks” rapper a “jackass” in a leaked conversation with an ABC reporter.

"Kanye West Explains Why Lil Durk ""Broke His Heart"" & Fell Out With Him","Kanye West's new interview on Justin LaBoy's The Download podcast contained a whole lot of scandalous, bizarre, or interesting revelations. We could talk about the ""Like That"" remix he premiered, his lewd obsession with Michelle Obama, the alleged assault investigation against him after Bianca Censori was allegedly sexually assaulted... it's a doozy. However, something that folks probably didn't expect to hear about was that Ye and Lil Durk fell out of favor with each other, or at least, that's how the Yeezy mogul sees things. They previously collaborated on various cuts, and as two Chicago rappers, some hometown fans likely feel very disappointed by this rift.
""Durk sent in a verse and he said, ‘Take my Yeezy shirt off and make it a doormat,'"" Kanye West claimed of Lil Durk. ""He said it four times. I hit him up and said, ‘You’re breaking my heart. Who told you to do this?’ I’m like, ‘Man, this is bad for the city. Who told you to do this?’ It’s like when J. Cole did the diss track or whatever. You got Drake, he’s really paid to come at my neck. But it’s another thing for somebody like that to come around you. It’s the whole friends [and] enemies talk.

Kanye West Speaks On Lil Durk: Watch
""He must have never really liked me,"" Kanye West went on concerning Lil Durk. I don’t know exactly what it is. I spoke to this man a few times about the line and then he changed the line to: ‘I take my Yeezy hat off and give my lil’ h*e that.’ And I’m just like, ‘Why y’all think y’all can play with me?'"" It seems like he might be referring to a leaked track off an upcoming VULTURES volume, ""Field Trip,"" which also reportedly features Playboi Carti and Kodak Black.
Meanwhile, the ""PROBLEMATIC"" creative also expressed that these lyrics hurt him more than Drake taking Smurk on tour during the VULTURES 1 rollout. ""And it’s f**k Drake for taking Durk right at the beginning of the Vultures role [sic] out I’ll come back to yall if I think of more f**k you’s,"" he had ranted on Instagram. These issues between these former partners could extend to them removing each other's contributions off of their respective most recent albums, or perhaps some disagreements over label contracts. All of that, though, is purely speculative. Nevertheless, for more news and the latest updates on Kanye West and Lil Durk, keep checking in with HNHH.

Why are celebrities destroying multimillion dollar mansions?,"Looking for a bargain beach house? Then you’re in luck. Kanye West has just lowered the price on his minimalist mansion in Malibu, California, to a mere $39m (£31.5m) – a $14m discount on its original listing price. There is a catch though: the house has no windows, doors, electricity, plumbing or interior finishes. It’s completely uninhabitable, unless you happen to be a gull.
The sparseness isn’t a deliberate design choice – though you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. West, who also goes by the name Ye, is after all a man who opened up a lawsuit-magnet of a private school in Los Angeles called Donda Academy which, according to court filings, had empty windows because the musician “doesn’t like glass”. Ye is, to put it in the politest terms possible, an individual with eccentric tastes.
Still, the reason that the mansion looks like it has been abandoned to the elements is not because of aesthetics; it’s because it has, in fact, been abandoned to the elements. Back in 2021 – shortly before brands cut ties with Ye for a series of outrageous antisemitic remarks – the entertainer, flush with cash, spent $57m (£46m) on the pad. The attraction? It was one of just a handful of homes in the US designed by Tadao Ando, a celebrated Japanese architect. Ando is known for his concrete box houses which look like hideous bunkers to my untrained eye but are, apparently, architectural marvels. ARTnews, for example, called the residence, “part house, part sculpture”.
Despite the fact that he’d spent top dollar on a “part sculpture”, Ye decided to completely gut and redesign the place. According to a contractor who is now suing Ye for labour code violations and unpaid wages, Ye wanted it to look like a “bomb shelter from the 1910s”. He reportedly planned on replacing all the stairs with slides and “wanted no electricity”. I mean, the guy could have saved himself $57m and just gone and lived in a squat.
Eventually, Ye gave up the whole project. Not because it was completely bonkers, mind you, but because he thought the house was the wrong shade of grey. “Unfortunately, the concrete settled into more of a cadet gray and he was hoping for a warmer tone, more of dovetail gray or coachman’s cape,” an insider told the Daily Mail. “Ye would only visit the house at sunrise and sunset, when he said the color didn’t irritate him so much. Eventually, he stopped going altogether.” Must be nice, in the middle of a global housing crisis, to have a cool $57m to spend on a house that you immediately destroy, eh?
He isn’t the only celebrity to spend a fortune on a house only to wreck it. Chris Pratt and his wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger, recently dropped $12.5m [£10m] on a mid-century home, designed by renowned architect Craig Ellwood, which had been featured in architectural magazines. The pair caused a huge uproar last week, after they razed the house to the ground to build a 15,000-sq ft modern farmhouse mansion.
The modern farmhouse, for those who aren’t familiar with the style, is the architectural equivalent of a pumpkin spice latte: ubiquitous and insipid. The New York Times has called it “the millennial answer to the baby boomer McMansion” and mused that its popularity might be a response to social upheaval. In times of uncertainty, the NYT has noted, it feels fitting that Americans are gravitating towards “a look that makes you think of Little House on the Prairie, but only if the Ingalls family lived in the suburbs and worked in finance”.
The Pratt-Schwarzenegger mansion may be wasteful and uninspired but at least it sounds cosier than a bomb shelter from the 1910s. Indeed, in the grand scheme of celebrity mansions, it’s not so bad. It’s certainly more inviting than Kim Kardashian’s beige concrete house, which has been compared to a “psych ward”. Her house is so anaemic she gives staff guidelines on how to colour-coordinate with the neutral tones and apparently buys beige snacks for her kids. And, as if one extremely grey house isn’t enough, Kardashian is building a fleet of them: she’s currently working on a spaceship-shaped house in Palm Springs, California, that she describes as “concrete, grey-toned, and really Zen.” As Dorothy Parker said: “If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it to.”",2024-04-23T15:25:05Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
"Charlamagne Tha God Goes Off On Kanye West, Reveals He's Been Hating On Drake For Years","Charlamagne Tha God discussed Kanye West's ongoing feud with Drake during the latest episode of The Breakfast Club. In doing so, he revealed the Vultures rapper has been hating on Drake for longer than fans may realize. In particular, he recalled one instance when Ye slammed Drake and Virgil Abloh during an interview years ago.
""Kanye West is the leader of the legion of lame,"" Chalamagne began. ""What a hating ass human. What type of man sits around and says we were all energized by the elimination of another man? This man is so miserable and has never dealt with whatever hurt and pain he's feeling and he just wants to project it onto other people. I don't even want Kendrick to respond no more. On 'Like That,' he clowned Drake and Cole for cliquing up. Don't you be a part of the legion of lame, Kendrick. Future, you neither. Run from Kanye. Metro what are you doing? All of y'all should be running from Kanye West. Have you not read the 48 laws of power? Avoid the unhappy and the unlucky. You can die from somebody else's misery. Kanye made the whole thing corny. It was entertaining until he brought his jealous, envious ass into the picture. So lame.""

Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori said to find Taylor Swift's Kim Kardashian diss song 'very amusing',"Bianca Censori is said to find Taylor Swift’s Kim Kardashian diss song “all very amusing”.
The 34-year-old pop superstar was branded a snake and a “liar” when a public dispute between her and Kim’s then-husband Kanye West, 46, led to the reality TV star releasing a private telephone call between the pair - and Taylor appears to have brought the bad blood back to the surface by working Kim’s name into the title of a song on her latest album, ‘The Tortured Poets Department’.
In the track ‘thanK you aIMee’ certain letters have been capped up to spell out the name ‘Kim’ and the lyrics suggest Taylor is describing the aftermath of the pair’s fall out.
She sings: “When I picture my hometown / There’s a bronze spray-tanned statue of you / And a plaque underneath it / That threatens to push me down the stairs, at our school ...
TheNightly Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. READ NOW
“All that time you were throwin’ punches, I was buildin’ somethin’ / And I can’t forgive the way you made me feel / Screamed ‘F*** you, Aimee” to the night sky, as the blood was gushin’ / But I can’t forget the way you made me heal.”
She goes on to add: “And it wasn’t a fair fight, or a clean kill / Each time that Aimee stomped across my gravе / And then she wrote hеadlines/ In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I’d take.”
Taylor concludes by confirming she’s changed the name of the woman she’s singing about - further fuelling speculation the track is about Kim.
She goes on to sing: “And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues / And one day, your kid comes home singin’ / A song that only us two is gonna know is about you.”
Kanye’s wife, Bianca, 29, is said to find it hilarious and is even said to be a fan of the ‘Bad Blood’ hitmaker’s music.
An insider told Life and Style: “I’ve heard she likes Taylor’s music and think it’s all fair play.
“Taylor wouldn’t have written a diss track aimed at Kim if she wasn’t prepared for some sort of backlash.
“But Taylor won’t be retaliating, the song speaks for itself. She clearly doesn’t care.”
Taylor and Kanye fell out in 2016 over his song ‘Famous’ which included the lyric: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that ***** famous.”
Kanye claimed the singer had approved the words, but Taylor insisted she didn’t, and Kim later released a phone call between the pair which suggested the pop star had indeed given the rapper permission to use those lyrics.
Taylor is believed to have subsequently decamped to London where she spent time with her then-boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn, and in a recent interview with Time magazine she claimed the incident ruined her life.
She said: “You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar.
“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”
She added: “[It was] a career death. Make no mistake - my career was taken away from me ... “
However, Taylor returned a year later with her 2017 album ‘Reputation’ which alluded to the previous year’s drama.
Four years after the initial phone call leak, a longer version of the audio appeared online in 2020 which made it seem like the first release had been edited down.
At the time of the 2020 release, Kim defended her decision to share the audio on social media, insisting “I feel I’m left without a choice but to respond because she is actually lying.”",2024-04-23T15:00:31Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow
Kanye West Explains What Happened During Alleged Bianca Censori Sexual Assault,"Kanye West made some headlines last week after he became the subject of a police investigation out in Los Angeles. Originally, it was reported that he allegedly punched a man in the face. However, it was later alleged that the man had sexually assaulted Censori, which is what led to Ye's actions. Overall, it all seemed unfortunate, and fans were immediately on Ye's side, as you always have to protect your family. During a recent interview with Justin Laboy, Ye was given the opportunity to explain what allegedly went down.
In fact, this was the first subject that was touched on in the interview. As Ye explains, he and Censori were in a hotel, where she was looking to go to the bathroom. She alleges that a man came up to her and grabbed her. Ye never saw it go down, but he made sure to talk to security about the whole thing. Kanye subsequently revealed that he told the man to leave the premises, but he allegedly refused. That is when Kanye said that he had to put the man to sleep, which has obvious implications.

Kanye West and Bianca Censori Would Have a Threesome With This Celeb,"Leave it to Kanye “Ye” West to say what’s on his mind. The 46-year-old rapper sat down for an interview on “The Download” podcast and was asked who he and his wife, Bianca Censori, would have a threesome with. Fans couldn’t believe which major A-lister Ye named.
“Michelle Obama!” the “Stronger” rapper said, according to Daily Mail, before adding, “You gotta f**k the president’s wife!’
This isn’t the first time that Ye has mentioned the former First Lady of the United States in a public comment. In 2013, he claimed his then-fiancée, Kim Kardashian, was more deserving to be on the cover of Vogue than Michelle, 60.
“There’s no way Kim Kardashian shouldn’t be on the cover of Vogue. She’s like the most intriguing woman right now,” Ye told Ryan Seacrest at the time. “She’s got Barbara Walters calling her like everyday. And collectively, we’re the most influential with clothing. No one is looking at what [Barack Obama] is wearing. Michelle Obama cannot Instagram a [swimsuit] pic like what my girl Instagrammed the other day.”
Ye recently made headlines after he was reportedly named a suspect by the Los Angeles Police Department for allegedly punching a man in the face. The scuffle reportedly took place at the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Boulevard in L.A. on April 16. Ye allegedly hit the man for sexually assaulting Bianca, 29.
A rep for Ye clarified that the Grammy Award winner was defending the Australia native because the man allegedly touched her inappropriately.
“He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses,” the rep told TMZ. “She was battered and sexually assaulted. ‘Grabbed’ is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted.”
Ye and Bianca have been married since December 2022. Although they have not spoken in detail about their marriage in public, the pair have been spotted in L.A. over the past few months with Bianca wearing provocative outfits. Previously, Ye and Bianca were rumored to have split late last year, but they quickly shut down the speculation after they were spotted together at a fashion show.
If you or anyone you know has been sexually abused, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673).

He ranted about his relationship with Drake during an interview with Justin Laboy on his The Download podcast over the weekend.
When Elliott Wilson shared the picture on Twitter, on Monday, fans still came to Kanye's defense, despite the apparent hypocrisy. ""Ye was in the Sunken Place. Now he’s out,"" one user wrote. Another added: ""Drake against a whole gauntlet of foes. Hard to root against the lone wolf.""

As for Kanye's previous comments, he claimed: ""Drake has a rich baby daddy, named Lucian [Grainge] and Universal. He's like, 'My daddy got it. My daddy control the spins. My daddy got the DSPs.' Drake has a rich baby daddy named Lucian."" From there, he claimed Grainge works for ""people who control the banks in Africa."" Ye also references Grainge in the lyrics to his new remix of Metro Boomin and Future's ""Like That."" He raps: “Pluto sent the drones, it hit like Metro beats/ It’s a wrap for n**gas, where’s Lucian? Serve ya’ master, n**ga/ You caught a little bag for your masters didn’t ya’, lifetime deal, I feel bad for n**gas/ Y’all so outta sight outta mind, I can’t even think of a Drake line/ Play J.

Kanye West Receives Truly Bizarre Character Description From White Nationalist Nick Fuentes,"Back in 2022, Kanye West found himself amongst white nationalists. People like Milo Yiannopoulos and Nick Fuentes were key figures of his anti-semitic musings. Overall, fans were not amused by these associations. Eventually, Milo became the Yeezy Chief of Staff, which still confuses some. Meanwhile, Fuentes is still on a high from his days hanging out with Ye. Whenever he has the opportunity, he will talk about Kanye and the vibes he got from him. For instance, on a live stream with Sneako, Fuentes spoke about Ye and the way he allegedly switches up how he acts amongst different people.
“He would have to kind of tone up the Blackness when he was with other Black people. I noticed this,” he said. “When he was with the Black people, he would kind of tone up how Black he was acting. When he knew he was safe, when he knew it was a judgement-free zone and he could be himself, that’s when he realized his mom was a professor. And he didn’t come from Chicago, he came from Hyde Park. Big difference.""

Fuentes is speaking with extreme prejudice when he says this kind of stuff. After all, he has been adamant about his white nationalist positions. Furthermore, he even went so far as to say that deep down, Ye is a white autistic person. It's all very bizarre and a great indication that Ye should have never gotten himself involved with the likes of Fuentes and his ilk. “He came from the campus of University of Chicago,"" Fuentes continued. ""He liked art, he liked poetry. You know, he’s like a white autist in many ways. He’s got the soul of a white autist. That’s what fuels his genius; not playing into this gang banger, ‘I fucked your bitch’ whatever.”

Kanye West Makes Shocking Comments About Michelle Obama for Wanting to Spice up His Love Life,"Kanye West recently disclosed that if he and his spouse could have sexual relations with a single woman, Michelle Obama would be his top choice.

As reported by The Mirror, West spoke regarding a threesome with his wife to the musician Justin Laboy on his program The Download. When the moderator inquired which celebrity West would approve, he replied, ""Michelle Obama,"" before unearthing hilarity. Additionally, he stated, ""Got to f**k the President's wife."" The reason behind West's selection of the former First Lady of the United States remained unexplained. Laboy and Ye both elicited hearty laughter in response to his absurdly candid sexual confession.

Fans immediately condemned the rapper's 'nasty' and 'sickening' response on X, where they inundated the platform with comments. One user added, ""On behalf of all the people on planet Earth, we are sincerely tired of Kanye West."" Another person commented, ""Ye is so disrespectful, he doesn’t even care about his wife’s feelings."" A third one added, ""Sadly I’ve come to expect this type of bizarre behavior from him."" A fourth one wrote, ""Kanye West's provocative statements can draw attention but they often overshadow his music and artistic contributions.""

Additionally, the former lady never hesitated to aim her criticism at West. Michelle delivered a memorable veiled jab at West during his 2020 presidential campaign. She implored Democrats to disregard Ye and cast their ballots for Joe Biden at the Democratic National Convention. She said at the time, ""This is not the time to withhold our votes in protest or play games with candidates who have no chance of winning.""
In a 2009 release, former president Barack Obama referred to West as a 'jackass' in an off-the-record remark. The former president also provided West with campaign advice in 2015, after the rapper declared his intention to run for president in 2020. As reported by Vibe, he said, ""Saying that you have a ‘Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’ — that’s what’s known as ‘off-message’ in politics. You can’t say something like that. There are a lot of people who have lost their congressional seats saying things like that.""

YesJulz Alleges Kanye West Was Supposed To Be On Adin Ross' Stream But It Fell Through For This Reason,"YesJulz and Kanye West recently had a falling out due to the fact that she allegedly broke her NDA. In fact, Milo Yiannopoulos was the one to fire Julz, and he claimed that she was going to be sued for $8 million. Overall, the lawsuit is in a state of limbo right now.

Ross is someone who has been trying to get Kanye West on his stream for ages. Overall, he is a massive fan of the artist, so it only makes sense that he would try and talk with him. After all, he has had massive rappers on his platform before. Well, as Julz explains, Kanye and Adin were supposedly going to link up a few months back. The deal was that Ross would pay $2 million. Allegedly, $1 million would go to Ye while the other $1 million would end up in the hands of a charity.

"‘A lot of rich guys arguing’: inside the rap beef of the decade with Drake, Kendrick Lamar and more","One rapper is accused of being derivative while another is mocked for his height. This jibe leads another to join in and accuse the taller man of having buttock implants. A fourth man decides to join in, but quickly retracts his comments for the sake of an easier life. And so it goes on, a feud labelled as a “civil war” in US rap, despite many of the lyrics (so far) leaning towards playground-level insults.
It would be noteworthy enough to have even two of America’s biggest rappers embroiled in a spat – but around a dozen are currently engaged in this feud, with new beefs cropping up seemingly daily. Drake, Kendrick Lamar, J Cole, Future, the Weeknd and Rick Ross are among the combatants; Kanye West entered the fray over the weekend, while a separate squabble between R&B singer Chris Brown and rapper Quavo has also sprung into life, seemingly sparked in the heat of the current conflagration.
To the uninitiated, it might resemble the kind of fiery combat that culminated with the murders of feuding rap titans 2Pac and the Notorious BIG in the mid-1990s. But for Alphonse Pierre, rap critic at Pitchfork, it feels much more like “a lot of rich guys arguing”. He compares the situation to 50 Cent beefing with 90% of the industry when he released The Massacre in 2005 – and he senses it will stick to songs rather than result in real-life violence.
This unprecedented multi-person slanging match began in March, when Lamar made a guest appearance on Like That, the raucous No 1 single from producer Metro Boomin and rapper Future’s collaborative latest album We Don’t Trust You.
“All your dogs getting buried,” Lamar rapped with venom, mocking Drake’s 2023 album For All the Dogs. “He gon’ see the Pet Sematary!” His verse appeared to take offence to a guest verse on Drake’s For All the Dogs single First Person Shooter, in which fellow rapper J Cole had rapped that the trio were “the big three” of mainstream rap. “Motherfuck the big three … it is just me,” Lamar hit back.
Drake and Lamar have been exchanging barbs for years, with many believing Lamar’s 2015 hit King Kunta – “a rapper with a ghostwriter? What the fuck happened?” – was aimed at rap’s biggest mainstream superstar. But the clash never really progressed beyond cryptic disses until recent weeks, prompting Drake to fire back with his own song Push Ups, with juvenile digs at Lamar’s 5ft 5in stature (“How the fuck you big steppin’ with a size-seven men’s on?”) and his suburbia-friendly collaborations with Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift. Last weekend brought another track, Taylor Made Freestyle, with Drake suggesting Lamar has stayed quiet since Like That out of fear of being eclipsed by Swift’s new album release. Drake even used AI technology to imitate the voices of 2Pac and Snoop Dogg, and criticise their fellow LA rapper Lamar’s supposed cowardice.
On the title track to We Don’t Trust You, Future accused Drake of “acting like a fed” amid rumours of them sharing lovers, and Cole’s own offering was 7 Minute Drill, which insinuated that Lamar’s career had “fallen off like the Simpsons”. But he swiftly pulled it from streaming platforms, saying that dissing “didn’t sit right with my spirit”. It took him out of the game, says Chicago rapper Chris Crack: “That was like when Black people are having a party and 9pm rolls around so the kid goes to bed and the adults can get wild.” Cole, he says, “can spin it all the ways he’d like, but it was cowardly, and he is one of the little guys now.”
Then came another new Future and Metro Boomin album, We Still Don’t Trust You, where high-profile guests A$AP Rocky and the Weeknd made semi-veiled disses against Drake, respectively for being jealous of Rocky’s relationship to singer Rihanna and whether Drake can really be a self-styled gangster when he makes so many TikToks. Adding even more spice, Drake’s former friend, rapper Rick Ross, started attacking him on Instagram and released his own diss song, Champagne Moments, which makes the bizarre claim Drake has had cosmetic surgery on his buttocks; Drake retorted with insults about the size of his Miami house.

It means April has been the cruellest month in terms of diss tracks for years: a major chapter in one of rap’s most longstanding traditions. From Boogie Down Productions’ The Bridge Is Over to 2Pac’s bloodthirsty Hit Em Up, the genre has always seen its biggest stars compete for lyrical supremacy using imaginative insults, and Pitchfork’s Pierre says the beefs are good for creativity as new rappers such as Sexyy Red and GloRilla come to dominate the conversation: “This beef probably came around at a good time for the slightly older guard, who definitely needed a little juice.” Drake also perhaps senses this is a source of rap-scene credibility to offset his often pop-leaning music, and a chance to redeem himself after being seen as the loser in a bitter 2018 feud with Pusha T, who used diss track The Story of Adidon to reveal Drake had secretly fathered a child.
As fans wait for a Lamar retort to Drake, some have spread fake AI-made Lamar disses online with the intention of stirring up misinformation. As well as Drake’s fake AI west coast legends, some initially suspected his track Push Ups of being AI-created. Producer Brainorchestra says AI is worrying, and threatens the legitimacy of the craft. If a rapper’s “diss isn’t received well, they then just pretend it was made by AI,” he says. “In the future real-life violence could even happen due to fake AI disses.”
Meanwhile, every few hours on social media someone posts a meme depicting Drake as Marvel supervillain Thanos – a lone god battling for survival against a squad of superhero peers – and Thanos, of course, ended up vanquished. But whatever the outcome, Crack cannot see the “Drake era” stopping any time soon. “I definitely think this is all about dethroning the ‘king’,” he says. “But if it takes the whole industry to take down one man, then they’re already admitting he’s the king.”",2024-04-23T09:47:02Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
Kanye West Faces Backlash For Comments About Michelle Obama: 'Gotta F**k The President’s Wife!',"> Entertainment
Kanye West is at it again.
The rapper, known for making outlandish and bizarre comments, many of which today are unforgettable classic one-liners, recently appeared on Justin Laboy’s The Download podcast.
At one point during the episode, Laboy asked Ye that if he could engage in a ménage à trois with “anyone in the world,” who would it be? Laboy also insinuated that he already knew Ye’s answer before he even said it.
Without wasting any time, Ye said “Michelle Obama,” followed by “Gotta f**k the President’s wife!” Though it can be argued that what Kanye said was nothing more than a tongue-in-cheek comment.

Michelle Obama is, of course, Barack Obama’s wife and the former First Lady of the United States of America.
Kanye West, who is now married to Bianca Censori, an Australian architect and model, was once called a ‘jackass’ by the former President Obama after he interrupted Taylor Swift’s speech after she won the Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.
As Taylor Swift was accepting the award, Kanye West stormed the stage to say that Beyoncé's music video for ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" was more deserving of the award, stating, ""I'm sorry, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time.""

During the infamous incident, Kanye went on stage and grabbed the microphone from Swift, saying that Beyoncé deserved the award instead. He has since been mired in a number of controversies – too many to list, honestly – but most recently, Kanye came under fire for praising Adolf Hitler and telling the Jews to forgive him already.
As a result of his controversial comments about Jews and Hitler, Kanye lost his Adidas shoe deal, and subsequently his billionaire status.

On the music front, Kanye West, in February this year, released Vultures 1, a collaborative album with Ty Dolla Sign.
The album debuted at number one in multiple countries, including the US, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, and many more.

Even the track Carnival from Vultures 1 reached the top-spot of the Billboard Hot 100.
Vultures will have two more parts – Vultures 2 and Vultures 3 – releasing later this year, though Kanye West is quite unreliable with his album release dates and a delay is very much possible.

"Kanye West Dubs Chris Brown A ""God"" Amidst Quavo Feud","Kanye West is an unpredictable guy. Fans can never predict what he's going to do or say next, and his recent appearance on The Download podcast was a startling reminder. He claimed he would have sex with Michelle Obama, called J. Cole a ""p**sy"" and vowed to ruin Drake's career. He did, however, take some time out to discuss artists he was a fan of, and felt deserved their fame. One of these artists was Chris Brown. At a seemingly random interval in the interview, West asserted that Brown was a ""god"" in the music industry.
The topic came about when Kanye West talked about restrictions within the music industry. He theorized that truly great artists have had a harder time breaking through due to the machinations of ""middle men."" He even referenced his own verse on the song ""Carnival,"" which name drops Brown. ""I'm the new Jesus, bitch,"" West rapped. ""I turn water to Crist, this for what they did to Chris. They can't do sh*t with this."" In the emcee's estimation, Brown is one of the aforementioned ""greats"" that deserves to thrive. ""Chris is a god,"" he asserted.

Kanye West Has Praised Brown For Decades
This is not the first time Kanye West has spoken in Brown's defense. He asked fans to forgive the R&B singer shortly after he was charged with assaulting Rihanna in 2009. ""Can't we give Chris a break?"" he asked during his VH1 Storytellers performance. ""I know I make mistakes in life."" West also gifted Brown with a YEEZY truck in 2020. The truck came with a written letter that read: ""Congratulations to Chris, 20 years in the game you have overcome many hurdles and obstacles, you deserve the recognition for all the hard work you have put in.""
The affection Kanye West and Chris Brown have for another contrasts with some of their other high profile relationships. Both men are involved in feuds with other hip-hop superstars, and have dropped diss tracks in the last week. West released a remix of the Future and Metro Boomin smash single ""Like That,"" which took at Drake, while Brown bombed on Quavo with ""Weakest Link."" Both disses were well received, with many feeling that Chris Brown delivered the decisive blow in the Quavo feud. The muted response to Quavo's ""Over Hoes & B*tches"" all but solidified this theory. West, meanwhile, is still at war with the 6 God.

"Kanye West Dismisses Drake's Music: ""Your Raps Don't Mean Sh*t""","Drake can't catch a break. He was already forced to fend off attacks from some of the biggest names in hip-hop, and now he has contend with the rapper he's cited as his biggest influence: Kanye West. Drake and West have had a notoriously fickle relationship over the years, but the latter has once again declared war on the 6 God. He released a remix to ""Like That,"" on The Download, and used the podcast platform to claim that Drake's career is ""artificial."" He didn't say industry plant, but he definitely made it seem as though Drake's success has been more calculated than fans have realized.
Kanye West felt ""Push Ups"" was a boring diss song. Despite being widely praised by fans and critics, West felt the diss lacked punch because of who Drake has become. ""Every bar that Drake said means nothing anymore,"" the rapper claimed ""Drop and give me 50, ain't nobody gonna drop and do sh*t. Your raps don't mean sh*t."" West has been critical of Drake's extreme popularity in the past. He famously ranted about the radio play that the DJ Khaled and Drake single ""For Free"" received during a 2016 concert. He got more specific about why he felt this way, however, during the Download interview.

Kanye West Felt Drake's Diss Was ""Artificial""
The ""Carnival"" rapper claimed that Drake is the beneficiary of the industry. ""[It's] a bunch of middle men controlling the market,"" he said. ""There are middle men saying 'this what diamonds cost'. And everybody running around. Drake, all this sh*t is artificial."" West's remarks about Drake's bars should be taken with a grain of salt, though, given that Drake has been credited (and occasionally uncredited) as a writer on several of the rapper's hits. Drake wrote the chorus to West's 2018 song ""Yikes,"" but was not officially credited because West's team claimed they ""forgot.""
Regardless of their prior collabs, Kanye West wants Drake gone. ""That's why gods had to come,"" he asserted. ""Pack that boy up."" In a previous Download clip, West said that he was excited to team up with Future and Metro Boomin on what he called the ""elimination"" of Drake. In his estimation, ruining Drake's career is a professional as well as personal goal. ""I'm tired of this guy f**king with me, so the fact that all these is coming together,"" he added. ""We gon' tear the head off whoever they thought was in control."" Time will tell if West and company succeed.

"Kanye West Calls Kai Cenat An Industry Plant: ""He's On The Wrong Side""","Kanye West is not happy. The controversial rapper went absolutely nuclear during his recent appearance on The Download podcast. He premiered a remix of the diss track ""Like That,"" vowed to help bring about the ""elimination of Drake,"" and dismissed J. Cole outright. In the midst of these inflammatory statements, West found time to address hip-hop streamer Kai Cenat. He claimed Cenat was a textbook example of an ""industry plant,"" and someone who peddled lies in order to profit from artists. ""[Kai] is on the wrong side of the future,"" he asserted.
Kanye West did not appreciate the fact that Cenat posted negative things about his Yeezy fashion line on social media. ""If you posting something negative you just on the wrong side of the future,"" he explained. ""We out here, stepping away from Adidas. The sh*t that Kai sent, that's some industry plant sh*t."" West was asked by the Download host whether he actually thought Cenat was a plant, and he doubled down. ""Of course!,"" he exclaimed. ""That exact genre is the most industry plant. It's about like, influence and mind control.""
Read More: Kanye West Wants To Have A Threesome With Michelle Obama: ""Got To F**k The President's Wife""
Kanye West Criticized Cenat For Spreading Negativity
The thing that really angered West, however, was when Cenat made reference to West's daughter North during a stream. ""Then he's gonna mention my daughter's name,"" the rapper noted. ""Don't mention my daughter's name and then you dissing what's paying their $200,000 a month child support. That don't make God happy."" Kanye West's comments on Kai Cenat shouldn't come as a surprise to fans, given the tension between them in recent weeks. The latter criticized West's clothing line during a stream, and the rapper sent him an Instagram DM. Cenat shared the DM with fans, which led to him getting on the phone with West's manager, John Monopoly.
It's ironic that Kanye West is criticizing Cenat for negativity during an interview in which he's blatantly attacking other people. West has a long track record of not practicing what he preaches, however, so it's par for the course. The rapper also confirmed that he'll be releasing Vultures 2, his second collaboration album with Ty Dolla $ign, on May 3. It was originally supposed to drop in March, but was delayed by a few months because West was ""still in the lab"" making changes.

"Kanye West Obliterates J Cole In New Interview: ""He Can't Run Now""","J Cole aspired to be Kanye West when he started out. He rapped and produced like West, he did his own version of West's ""Last Call"" on his breakout mixtape, and he signed a record deal with Jay-Z. The list of similarities dwindled over the years, as Cole developed his own persona, but West remained an influence. This context is useful in the wake of West's brutal interview comments. The polarizing pop star recently went on The Download podcast to discuss the Big Three feud, and he absolutely laid into Cole.
West was asked how he felt about J. Cole apologizing to Kendrick Lamar, and he did not mince words. He was not a fan. ""F**k all that pussy sh*t,"" West told The Download host. ""F**k all that sh*t. Because, like that n**ga J. Cole went on tour with Drake, he know what it is. Like, n**ga, you can't run now. It's you also."" Kanye West went a step further, and stated that he's never listened to J. Cole's music or co-signed him as an artist. ""I don't listen to J. Cole so I wouldn't even know,"" he explained. ""I just heard he had a song called 'False Prophets' and somebody told me it's halfway about me.""
Read More: Kanye West Wants To Have A Threesome With Michelle Obama: ""Got To F**k The President's Wife""
Kanye West Doesn't Listen To Cole's Music
The podcast host tried to get some semblance of positivity by asking West if it was ""up"" for J. Cole, but West did not budge. In fact, he doubled down. ""You can’t put Cole and 'up' in the same sentence."" This is only the latest instance of the rapper going about Cole in a public space. West previewed a remix of Future and Metro Boomin's ""Like That"" on The Download, and the track included the line: ""Play J. Cole, get that p**sy dry."" He then posted a meme on his Instagram account that sees a cartoon get sexually rewarded for not listening to Cole's music. Absolutely brutal.
West had plenty of withering things to say about Drake, the main target of his remix verse, but the lengths he's gone to dismiss Cole makes it clear that he does not see the Dreamville boss as a legit threat. The general consensus in the hip-hop world is that Cole's handling of the Kendrick Lamar feud has been poor, but nobody has taken him to task the way that West has. It's safe to assume we won't be seeing a collaboration from these two artists in the near future.

Mann geschlagen? Kanye West äußert sich zu Gewaltvorwürfen,"Kanye West (46) bricht sein Schweigen. Vor wenigen Tagen soll der Rapper einem Mann ins Gesicht geschlagen haben. Nun erklärt der ""Stronger""-Interpret, was es mit dem Vorfall auf sich hatte. In dem Podcast ""The Download"" schildert er, dass der Mann seine Ehefrau Bianca Censori (29) unangemessen berührt hatte. Kanye habe den mutmaßlichen Täter daraufhin aufgesucht und ihn aufgefordert, zu gehen. ""Ich habe mit dem Mann gesprochen und gesagt: 'Sie müssen jetzt sofort gehen', und er meinte: 'Oh, es ist okay. Und ich sagte: 'Nein, es ist nicht okay'"", erinnert er sich zurück. Als der Mann der Forderung nicht nachkam, sei es eskaliert. ""Er musste früh ins Bett gehen...Ich habe [...] ihn zugedeckt"", umschreibt er die Situation.
Ähnliches schilderte auch ein Vertreter des Rappers in einem Interview mit TMZ. Gegenüber einem Reporter machte der Angestellte deutlich, wie sehr Kanyes Frau angegangen wurde: ""Der Angreifer stieß nicht nur mit ihr zusammen. Er steckte seine Hände unter ihr Kleid, direkt auf ihren Körper, er packte sie an der Taille, drehte sie herum und warf ihr dann Küsse zu. Sie wurde misshandelt und missbraucht."" Zu dem mutmaßlichen Schlag äußerte sich das Team des ""Can't Tell Me Nothing""-Interpret damals jedoch nicht.
In der Vergangenheit hatte Kanye bereits mehrfach mit körperlichen Auseinandersetzungen auf sich aufmerksam gemacht. Vor allem mit aufdringlichen Fotografen geriet der Musiker schon oft aneinander. Im Netz kursieren einige Videos, in denen sich der Yeezy-Gründer über Paparazzi aufregt. Auf YouTube kursiert beispielsweise ein Clip, der zeigt, wie Kanye einem Bildreporter die Kamera entwenden möchte.

Kanye West reveals dream of threesome with his wife and VERY famous First Lady,"Kanye West wants a threesome with his wife and Michelle Obama.
The scandal-plagued rapper, 46, made the admission when he was asked which celebrity he and his 29-year-old partner Bianca Censori would most like to bed together in a frank interview with Download.
He was seen flashing his rumoured $850,000 titanium teeth before exclaiming in response: “Michelle Obama!”
Kanye went on to add: “You gotta (have sex with) the president’s wife!”

Mum-of-two Michelle, 60, was First Lady of the US from 2009 to 2017 when her husband Barack Obama, 62, was president.
Kanye’s latest outburst comes after reports he was involved in a bust-up at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles on Wednesday ( 17.04.24.)
He is said to have gotten into a fight with a man Bianca claims physically and sexually assaulted her.
TMZ has reported Kanye punched one half of a set of twins who own numerous LA bars and restaurants – adding the rapper punched the wrong target.
The twins are Mark and Jonnie Houston, who own hotspots such as No Vacancy, Good Times at Davey Wayne’s and Black Rabbit Rose.
Kanye and Bianca are said to be claiming the model bumped into one of the brothers and he proceeded to assault her – but sources have told TMZ there’s no evidence of the allegations.
The insiders added to the outlet Bianca’s allegations are “totally off base and simply not accurate”.
It is not clear at this time which of the twins allegedly bumped in Bianca and which was apparently punched by Kanye.
Kanye, who was sensationally dumped from a string of big-name brand deals in the wake of his infamous anti-Semitic outbursts, is said to have left the Chateau Marmont after the alleged incident long before police turned up.
An investigation is underway, which will be sent to the City Attorney for review to see if any official charges will be filed.
One of Kanye’s representatives insisted in a statement Bianca was assaulted during the altercation, saying in a statement: “This was a physical, sexual assault and any attempt to undermine the seriousness of what happened is repellent and vile.”",2024-04-22T19:01:20Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow
Bianca Censori 'finds' Taylor Swift's feud with Kim Kardashian 'amusing',"Bianca Censori 'finds' Taylor Swift's feud with Kim Kardashian 'amusing'
Bianca Censori turned out to be a fan of Taylor Swift's music as she likes the singer's latest diss track, thanK you aIMee, about Kim Kardashian.
As reported by Life & Style, Kanye West's wife 'finds' the globally known musician's song ""very amusing.""
An insider claimed that the Australian beauty likes ""Taylor’s music and think it’s all fair play.""
For the unversed, Swift released her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, on Friday, April 19, which includes 31 songs.
One of Swift's tracks, thanK you aIMee, leaves her fans guessing that it is aimed at the reality TV star as the letters K, I and M are capitalised in the song's title.
The Bad Blood singer shared in her song that she used to be bullied by the socialite. The lyrics reads, ""There's a bronze spray-tanned statue of you and a plaque underneath it/That threatens to push me down the stairs, at our school.""
Moreover, reports are suggesting that the Lover singer took a dig at the reality TV star and his ex-husband Kanye in another track titled Cassandra.
It is pertinent to mention here that the two ladies first sparked woes over an audio recording when the rapper inappropriately used Swift's name in his song Famous.
However, Bianca's alleged liking for Swift suggests that the architectural designer has been enjoying the latest controversy involving her husband's ex-wife.",2024-04-22T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Kanye West ‘punched wrong man’ over alleged assault of Bianca Censori,"Sources claimed Ye and Bianca's claims are 'totally off base and simply not accurate'
Kanye West may have clocked the wrong man after he allegedly “physically and sexually assaulted” the rapper’s wife, Bianca Censori, at the Chateau Marmont lobby during their recent visit.
Last week, TMZ reported that the legendary rapper, 46, was named as a suspect for battery after punching a man in retaliation.
However, sources now claimed to the outlet that Ye actually attacked the wrong person; the Runaway hitmaker actually punched the twin brother of the man who was actually behind Bianca’s alleged assault.
The twins were identified as L.A bar and restaurant owners Mark and Jonnie Houston.
The initial LAPD report, obtained on Thursday, April 18 noted that the unidentified male first “pushed or grabbed” Ye’s wife, prompting Ye’s reaction.
However, Ye’s reps clarified in a statement that the phrasing “is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened.”
They emphasised, “The assailant didn’t merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted.”
However, sources told the outlet that Censori’s allegations are “totally off base and simply not accurate.”
They claim that the Houston twin had accidentally bumped into Censori in the heavily-crowded lobby and simply went on his way outside to sit with some friends.
West reportedly chased after him to confront him, but ended up punching the wrong man.",2024-04-22T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

Drake Confesses Kanye West Helped Him Write Lyrics In Newly Unearthed Tweet,"Last month, Kendrick Lamar sparked a beef that's pulling nearly every big name in rap music into its orbit. That began with a diss aimed at J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar on the Future & Metro Boomin song ""Like That."" Just after the beef was sparked, Kanye West weighed in. He's worked with both Drake and Kendrick in the past, but refused to take a side in the beef. instead, he took his own side, making an Instagram post taking shots at Drake and claiming he ""washed"" Kendrick Lamar in an Instagram post.
But West isn't done yet. He's been teasing his own remix of ""Like That"" for more than a week now and he played it for fans for the first time over the weekend. In the song, he takes shots at Drake while going in even harder on J. Cole. His attacks on Cole also extended to his Instagram where he shared some crude memes about the rapper. But with a renewed hostility between West and Drizzy, fans went digging for old posts and videos that aren't the best look for the ""Rich Baby Daddy"" rapper now. Check out what they found below.

Kanye West Shares How His Drake Diss Remix of 'Like That' Happened,"It was only a matter of time before Ye — formerly known as Kanye West — hopped into the Drake and Kendrick Lamar feud, with the 6 God at odds with several stars in the rap game.
Yeezy took aim at Drake over the weekend with the unofficial release of a remix to Future and Metro Boomin’s No. 1 hit “Like That,” which found Ye reigniting his feud by sniping at Drizzy.
West is set to appear on affiliate Justin LaBoy’s The Download podcast, and clips of the appearance were released on Monday (April 22). In them, the embattled Chicago mogul — who has faced criticism for his hate speech — explained why he felt “energized” to hit the studio, with Drake in rap’s crosshairs.
Trending on Billboard
“[Future] called me and I went to the studio and laid that. We went through the creative process of adding the chords and called the Hooligans out in London to get on the joint,” Ye explained. “Everybody was very, very energized about the elimination of Drake.”
Ye brought up Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge and Drake’s reported massive deal he made when re-signing with UMG in a landmark “LeBron-sized” agreement in 2022.
“Where’s Lucian? Serve your master, n—a/ You caught a little bag for your masters, didn’t ya/ Lifetime deal, I feel bad for n—as/ Y’all so outta sight, outta mind/ I can’t even think of a Drake line,” he raps.
Elsewhere in Ye’s interview with LaBoy, West referred to Grainge as Drake’s “Rich Baby Daddy” — in a jab at The Boy’s For All The Dogs anthem.
“You say rich baby daddy it’s like Drake has a rich baby daddy named Lucian and Universal,” he claimed. “It’s like, ‘My daddy got it. My daddy control the spins. My daddy got the DSPs.’ Drake has a rich baby daddy named Lucian.”
Drake and the “Carnival” rapper have continued to feud on-and-off over the years, and even a brief reconciliation at the 2021 Free Larry Hoover Benefit concert appears to have gone by the wayside.
“It cuts Drake’s soul. It’s like he signed his soul to the devil to not be cool with me. This is his job to go against God,” he added.
“Like That” has topped the Billboard Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, and is the first rap song to debut atop the summit for that timespan since Drake’s “Nice for What.” Kanye’s “Like That” remix isn’t on streaming services, but is available for purchase on the Yeezy website.
Look for the full interview with West on The Download at 7 p.m. ET Monday. Watch some of the referenced clips below.

Véritable star de la musique depuis des années, Kanye West est certainement l’un des rappeurs les plus connus et appréciés à travers le monde. Entre tous ses tubes que l’on connaît par coeur, ses multiples collaborations en tant que designer et ses (trop) nombreuses frasques perpétrées au fil des années, difficile de ne pas entendre parler de l’artiste multirécompensé.
Kanye West fou amoureux de Bianca Censori
Côté cœur, Kanye West est largement connu pour avoir vécu une belle et longue histoire d’amour avec Kim Kardashian. Ensemble, l’ex-couple partage la garde de North, Saint, Chicago et Psalm. C’est finalement en 2021 que le duo se sépare. Le divorce, lui, est officiellement prononcé en novembre 2022. Et force est de constater que Kanye West n’a pas perdu de temps pour la remplacer. Trois semaines seulement après son divorce avec Kim Kardashian, l’interprète du titre Good Morning a officialisé son histoire d’amour avec Bianca Censori, une ancienne architecte originaire d’Australie.
Bianca Censori agressée en plein jour
Et gare à ceux qui s’en prendront à la nouvelle femme de Kanye West. Depuis la semaine dernière, le rappeur fait l’objet d’une enquête pour coups et blessures. En réalité, ce dernier aurait pété un plomb et frappé au visage un homme qui se serait montré trop proche et insistant auprès de sa femme alors qu’ils étaient ensemble au Château Marmont, un hôtel tendance situé au cœur d’Hollywood. « L’agresseur ne s’est pas contenté de la percuter. Il a mis ses mains sous sa robe, directement sur son corps, il lui a attrapé la taille, il l’a fait tourner, puis il lui a envoyé des baisers. Elle a été malmenée et agressée sexuellement », a ainsi révélé le représentant du rappeur au sujet de Bianca. L’homme en question n’aurait pas eu besoin de se rendre aux urgences suite à l’altercation.
Kanye West frappe la mauvaise personne
Si l’histoire est complètement folle – malgré le fait que ce n’est pas la première fois que Kanye West pète un plomb en public – un nouvel élément de taille vient s’ajouter à l’affaire. Selon TMZ, qui avait déjà rapporté la bagarre, le rappeur de 46 ans a frappé la mauvaise personne. Et pour cause, celui qui a percuté Bianca Censori dans le lobby de l’hôtel était avec son frère jumeau.
Et visiblement, Kanye West n’a pas fait la différence entre l’un et l’autre lorsqu’il est venu le confronter à sa table. Les jumeaux en question ne sont pas totalement inconnus. Il s’agit de Mark et Jonnie Houston qui sont à la tête de plusieurs établissements tendance à Los Angeles. Pour le moment, la police essaie de faire la lumière sur cette affaire. Elle tenterait par ailleurs de joindre Kanye West. Reste à savoir si ce dernier sera oui ou non d’humeur à coopérer avec les forces de l’ordre.",2024-04-22T15:19:23Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
"Kanye West Wants To Have A Threesome With Michelle Obama: ""Got To F**k The President's Wife""","Kanye West says if he could sleep with any third woman in a threesome with his wife, Bianca Censori, he'd go with the former first lady, Michelle Obama. He made the remark while speaking with Justin Laboy on The Download podcast over the weekend. When Laboy prompted the question, Ye took a moment to collect his thoughts.

Elsewhere during the interview, West premiered a new remix of Metro Boomin and Future's song, ""Like That.""

Kanye West Explains Why He's Dissing Drake Again Despite Their Recent Reconciliation,"We'll probably never know if Kanye West was asked to insert himself in the Kendrick Lamar and Drake beef or if it was of his own volition. Either way, he seems to think there's truth to both narratives, as he explained during a recent interview on Justin LaBoy's podcast, The Download. For those unaware, the Chicago artist premiered his remix of ""Like That"" on this show following some leaks and previews from Adam22 that initially spread like wildfire on social media. When he played (and later released) the CDQ version, though, along with Metro Boomin's blessing, folks really knew that he was getting into it.
However, a lot of folks brought up that Ye and Drizzy had already ""made up"" with their Larry Hoover benefit concert in 2021, something that LaBoy asked his guest about. ""Y'all did the Hoover concert together,"" he told Kanye West. ""Me and the rest of the world thought y'all were back cool. What happened after that?"" ""It cuts Drake's soul,"" he responded. ""It's like he signed his soul to the devil to not be cool with me. This is his job, to go against God, and that cuts his soul.""

Elsewhere during this interview, the controversial designer also offered his own perspective on what made him want to do the ""Like That"" remix, and while it's an unconfirmed account, it's probably as much as we'll get about it. He said that Future was the one who hit him up to do the verse, and that folks in the rap game are ""energized"" by these shots at the OVO mogul. ""Everybody is very, very excited about the elimination of Drake,"" Kanye West expressed on The Download. In addition, he also claimed that Sir Lucian Grainge, the head of UMG, is The Boy's father due to the massive deal that they inked.
""Drake has a rich baby daddy, named Lucian [Grainge] and Universal,"" the VULTURES creative stated. ""He's like, 'My daddy got it. My daddy control the spins. My daddy got the DSPs.

Childish Gambino Sends Fans Into A Frenzy With Electric Kanye West Teaser,"Childish Gambino is getting ready to feed his starving fans in a big way very soon. The Georgia rapper and singer has been busy in Hollywood with acting roles lately, but new music will be coming up next. Just last week, he teased several new tracks off his upcoming reimagining of his last record 3.15.20 called Atavista. He did so during a GILGA Radio livestream last Sunday, and fans were having a blast hearing what he has been cooking up. Last night, Childish Gambino did the same thing again last night, and this time, a Kanye West collaboration was the highlight of the evening.
Accounts on X (formerly Twitter) were constantly resharing the audio clip and everyone is in agreement that it sounds fire. The snippet starts out with only Gambino rapping before revealing Kanye just seconds later. Production wise it sounds extremely familiar to a previous Ye record. The industrial and electronic beat would have fit snuggly on his 2013 experiment that was Yeezus.

Childish Gambino & Kanye West Are Flowing!
Childish was definitely not afraid to share most of the song, as the preview went on for nearly three minutes. At point, the two creative masterminds even trade bars back and forth, and they display some great chemistry during that stretch. If this officially sees the light of day, it will mark their first song together. Gambino has been on the record before saying that Kanye is still his G.O.A.T. rapper (greatest of all time), so this is truly a full circle moment.

"Kanye West Claims The ""Elimination Of Drake"" Is Energizing Himself And Others","Kanye West is someone who has beefed with Drake a ton in the past. Although he had seemingly made nice with the rapper thanks to the tutelage of J Prince, he is back to dissing the megastar. Overall, Ye had the rap game talking this weekend thanks to his verse on the ""Like That"" remix. Throughout this new version of the song, he takes shots at both J. Cole and Drizzy. Of course, Cole has dissed Kanye in the past, so this recent shot felt like one that was a bit overdue. It also led to some pretty hilarious memes on social media, but that is neither here nor there.
This was all released around the same time that Kanye West was doing an interview with none other than Justin Laboy. During this interview, Ye spoke up about the ""Like That"" remix and what made him want to do it. As he notes, Future was the first person to call him about getting on the remix. Moreover, he noted that the recent attacks on Drake are something that has everyone ""energized.""

Kanye West allegedly hit wrong twin brother after wife Bianca's altercation at LA’s Chateau Marmont,"Kanye West has been accused of assault following a bizarre series of events involving his wife, Bianca Censori, and two look-alike LA restauranteurs.
Eyewitnesses at the famous LA hotspot Chateau Marmont on Tuesday night told TMZ that a man accidentally bumped into the rapper’s Aussie wife in the hotel lobby during a busy period.
Under the impression the man “grabbed or pushed his wife,” Kanye allegedly took matters into his own hands.

The rapper is said to have made his way over to the table to confront the man who was sitting with friends.
In a bizarre twist, Kanye allegedly punched the man twice he believed had assaulted his wife, though being a twin, struck the wrong one.
Both twins are said to have been sitting at the table while this unfolded.
Mark and Jonnie Houston — the brothers in question — are renowned entrepreneurs known for owning a string of celebrity bars and clubs around Los Angeles.
No strangers to publicity themselves, they have been referred to as the “Winklevosses of LA nightlife” because they are behind popular bars, Break Room 86 and LINE LA.
Strangely, the identity of the twin Kanye allegedly hit, and the twin the artist believed assaulted his wife are not confirmed.

Named as a key suspect in a battery report, local police are investigating Kanye’s involvement in the incident.
A representative of the Yeezy founder told TMZ his side of events, referring to the altercation between Bianca and her alleged attacker.
“The assailant didn’t merely collide with her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted.”
However, no evidence or witnesses have come forward to back up Kanye’s claims, with TMZ sources saying his view of events is “totally off base and simply not accurate”.
The City Attorney will review the investigation to determine if official charges are filed.",2024-04-22T12:03:28Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow
Bianca Censori looks downcast and covered up with husband Kanye West after she was ‘assaulted’ at luxe LA hotspot,"KANYE West and his wife Bianca Censori have emerged donning restrained, all-white outfits in a somber new outing.
This comes after Kanye was accused of punching a man who he said inappropriately touched his wife at Chateau Marmot in Los Angeles.

Kanye, 44, and his new wife Bianca, 29, visited the Cienega Med Spa for a Sunday afternoon refresh in photos obtained by The U.S. Sun.
The couple arrived for the R&R session in a Tesla Cybertruck.
Unlike her normal style, Bianca was covered in layers of white robe-like fabric.
Kanye matched in white and looked as morose as she did as they exited the spa.
Kanye rocked a hoodie and sweatpants that hung low, while Bianca wore a top and white puffer vest.
THROWING HANDS
Kanye reportedly struck a well-known restauranteur while allegedly trying to defend his wife during a recent altercation at the famed Chateau Marmont.
According to TMZ, the Yeezy founder struck either Mark Houston or Jonnie Houston, who are twin restaurateurs.
However, it unclear to which one Ye landed the blows.
Sources claimed to the outlet on Saturday that one of the two “accidentally” bumped into Bianca – denying what the Runaway rapper’s camp previously claimed.
A rep for West told Page Six last week that the alleged assailant “didn’t merely collide into her.”
Instead, they claimed one of the two “put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses.”
“She was battered and sexually assaulted,” West’s rep previously insisted. “Bianca was physically assaulted.”
However, TMZ’s source claimed the incident was a misunderstanding and the restaurant was reportedly busy at the time, alleging the sexual assault allegations were false.
According to the outlet, Ye mistakenly confronted the twin, who wasn’t even involved in the interaction with Bianca.
“He actually ended up punching the wrong dude,” TMZ reported, adding that police sources “haven’t been able to dig up evidence that backs Kanye’s account.”

BOUND 2
Kanye West has found love again in the Australian architectural designer and model.
Born on January 5, 1995, in Melbourne, Australia, the 29-year-old started a jewelry company called Nylons after leaving high school.
Bianca later received a degree in architecture at the University of Melbourne, before working as a design consultant for a year.
After working as a student architect for three years, she completed a master's degree between 2019 and 2020 ahead of moving to Los Angeles.
On Friday, October 6, 2023, The Daily Mail reported Kanye and Bianca wed on December 20, 2022.
The couple tied the knot under a ""confidential marriage license"" in the state of California.
The two wed in Palo Alto, California, according to the document.
The wedding came just one month after Kanye and Kim finalized their divorce.
This marks Ye's second marriage and he and Kim share their four children.
'STRUGGLED'
While Kanye is known to be the center of attention, an insider told The U.S. Sun that his new wife has ""struggled"" with all the attention.
The source said Kanye is known to choose her outfits and that she is happy to follow his wishes.
They claimed, ""Bianca doesn't hang too much with her crowd, she's all about Kanye and mostly with him 24/7, but dating Kanye really can be a full-time job.
""She loves fashion and art and dressing up but she's not really about being famous, she is a lot more low-key than Ye's other exes.
""She has struggled with the paparazzi being around at times and doesn't want to be posting and giving interviews.""
The insider concluded, ""Bianca has known Ye a long time, she has a lot of patience, she knows how to handle him, and is happy for him to be in the forefront.""

Nach Schlag: Distanzierung zwischen Kanye West und Bianca?,"Vergangene Woche fiel Kanye West (46) erneut durch Negativschlagzeilen auf! Demnach soll der Rapper einen Mann angegriffen und geschlagen haben, nachdem dieser Kanyes Frau Bianca Censori (29) belästigt haben soll. Die Körpersprachen-Expertin Judi James analysierte nun die neusten Paparazzifotos des Ehepaares, die Mirror vorliegen, und spricht von einer ""unklaren Körpersprache von Bianca und Kanye"". Auf der einen Seite verhalten sich die beiden wohl wie eine starke Einheit, auf der anderen Seite könnte das Liebespaar aber auch distanziert voneinander wirken.
Wie auf den Fotos zu sehen ist, trägt Bianca ein weißes Outfit mit einem langärmligen Oberteil und kombiniert dazu eine weite Weste. Für ihre Verhältnisse scheint das etwas viel Stoff zu sein, meint Judi. Ihr All-White-Look passt offensichtlich zu ihrem Mann, der sich ebenso für einen weißen Pulli und eine weiße Hose entschieden hat. ""Sie ist auch äußerlich mit Kanye über ihre passenden weißen Outfits verbunden, sodass sie mehr denn je wie ein Paar oder sogar ein Promi-Power-Paar aussehen, was andeuten könnte, dass er sie damit glücklich machen möchte"", spekuliert die Expertin. Judi fällt aber vor allem auf, dass die beiden mit ihrer Erscheinung eher den Effekt einer ""Distanzierung"" erzielen. ""Bianca läuft vor, anstatt neben oder hinter Kanye und es gibt weniger verbindende Gesten als sonst, wie beispielsweise das Händchenhalten"", bemerkt sie. Ein weiterer Grund für eine mögliche Distanzierung zwischen Kanye und Bianca sieht Judi darin, dass der Rapper seine Hand in der Hosentasche versteckt, als würde er Berührungen mit seiner Frau vermeiden wollen. Könnte das darauf hinweisen, dass zwischen den beiden dicke Luft herrscht?
Böse Zungen behaupteten schon des Öfteren, dass der ""Stronger""-Interpret seine Frau kontrolliere, indem er ihr ihre freizügigen Outfits aussuche. In der Radioshow ""Ben, Liam & Belle"" stärkte eine entfernte Verwandte von Bianca dem Paar aber erst kürzlich den Rücken und beteuerte: ""Aber alles, was ich weiß, ist, dass sie verliebt und glücklich sind.""

Wegen Bianca: Schlug Kanye dem falschen Mann ins Gesicht?,"Hat er etwa den Falschen erwischt? Kanye West (46) sorgt derzeit wieder für Negativschlagzeilen: Vor wenigen Tagen soll der Rapper einem Mann ins Gesicht geschlagen haben. Grund für die krasse Entgleisung: Angeblich habe der Mann seine Frau Bianca Censori (29) belästigt. Nun veröffentlicht TMZ weitere Hintergründe zur Tat – demnach griff der Skandalrapper den falschen Mann an. Bei den beiden Männern, die in den Vorfall verwickelt sein sollen, handelt es sich laut dem Magazin um die Zwillingsbrüder Mark und Jonnie Houston. Die beiden haben mehrere angesagte Lokale in Los Angeles. Allerdings soll Kanye nicht dem Bruder ins Gesicht geboxt haben, der Bianca belästigt haben soll, sondern seinem Zwilling. Welcher der Zwillinge mit Bianca aneinandergeriet und welcher von dem ""Stronger""-Interpreten Schläge kassierte, ist nicht bekannt.
Laut Insidern, die sich gegenüber dem Blatt äußerten, seien Biancas Anschuldigungen ""völlig daneben und einfach nicht zutreffend"". Vertreter des Musikers sehen das allerdings anders. ""Der Angreifer stieß nicht nur mit ihr [Bianca] zusammen. Er steckte seine Hände unter ihr Kleid, direkt auf ihren Körper, er packte sie an der Taille, drehte sie herum und warf ihr dann Küsse zu. Sie wurde misshandelt und missbraucht"", heißt es in einer Erklärung.
Das ist nicht das erste Mal, dass Kanye handgreiflich geworden sein soll: Vergangenes Jahr warf ihm die Fotografin Nichol Lechmanik einen körperlichen Übergriff vor. ""Er griff in mein Auto, als wolle er mich schlagen, riss mir mein Handy aus der Hand und warf es dann wütend auf die Straße"", so Nichol laut Spiegel auf einer Pressekonferenz. Sie betonte: ""Er hat kein Recht, mich anzugreifen, zu verprügeln oder mir Angst davor zu machen, meinen Beruf auszuüben.""

vKanye West ‘punched wrong man’ over alleged assault of Bianca Censori,"Sources claimed Ye and Bianca's claims are 'totally off base and simply not accurate'
Kanye West may have clocked the wrong man after he allegedly “physically and sexually assaulted” the rapper’s wife, Bianca Censori, at the Chateau Marmont lobby during their recent visit.
Last week, TMZ reported that the legendary rapper, 46, was named as a suspect for battery after punching a man in retaliation.
However, sources now claimed to the outlet that Ye actually attacked the wrong person; the Runaway hitmaker actually punched the twin brother of the man who was actually behind Bianca’s alleged assault.
The twins were identified as L.A bar and restaurant owners Mark and Jonnie Houston.
The initial LAPD report, obtained on Thursday, April 18 noted that the unidentified male first “pushed or grabbed” Ye’s wife, prompting Ye’s reaction.
However, Ye’s reps clarified in a statement that the phrasing “is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened.”
They emphasised, “The assailant didn’t merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted.”
However, sources told the outlet that Censori’s allegations are “totally off base and simply not accurate.”
They claim that the Houston twin had accidentally bumped into Censori in the heavily-crowded lobby and simply went on his way outside to sit with some friends.

Kanye West Disses Drake and J. Cole on 'Like That' Remix Verse,"Ye is teasing his remix of Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar‘s “Like That” diss track.
The superstar rapper, formerly known as Kanye West, stopped by Justin LaBoy’s The Download podcast to premiere his fiery verse on the “Like That” remix, where he takes shots at Drake and J. Cole.
In a clip shared by Ye through Instagram on Saturday (April 20), the 46-year-old rapper is all smiles as he shares a portion of his scorching remix with LaBoy. The track opens with Ye referencing Lamar’s beef with Drake, saying, “You know we had to get the hooligans up here to get these p—y n—as out/ Yo Dot, I got you.”
From there, Ye takes direct hits at both Drake and J. Cole. “Y’all so out of sight, out of mind/ I can’t even think of a Drake line/ Play J. Cole, get the p—y dry/ Play this s— back 130 times.”
Trending on Billboard
The full version of Ye’s “Like That” remix had not officially surfaced on streaming services at press time on Sunday.
Lamar and Drake’s beef ignited with the Compton rapper’s explosive “Like That” verse that set the rap game on fire and remains at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. On the track — which appears on Future and Metro Boomin’s We Don’t Trust You album — K. Dot throws several volleys, suggestively targeting Drizzy and J. Cole.
“Yeah, get up with me, f— sneak dissing/ ‘First Person Shooter,’ I hope they came with three switches,” Lamar aggressively spews on his guest verse.
“First Person Shooter” was the joint song Drake and Cole released last year on which the latter boasted, “Love when they argue the hardest MC/ Is it K. Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?/ We the big three like we started a league.”
Ye’s “Like That” remix follows two recent responses from Drake, who officially dropped his “Push Ups” diss track through steaming services on Friday (April 19) and followed later that evening with “Taylor Made Freestyle” on social media. On “Taylor Made,” the 6 God uses AI verses in the style of Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg to further taunt Lamar, who has not yet responded to his “Push Ups” diss.",2024-04-21T17:55:51Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Kanye West Heats Rap's Civil War Up... Or Does He? Fans React To ""Like That"" Remix","Kanye West's ""Like That"" remix has added another explosive layer to the 20v1 between Kendrick Lamar, some company, and Drake. Of course, fans went absolutely wild with reactions to all this online, with some praising Ye for his verse and for his shots at Cole and Drake and others not being so impressed. Here are some opposing examples to set the stage a little bit. One common sentiment can be summed up with this tweet: ""One thing ‘bout Kanye… he’s gonna insert himself in a situation that doesn’t involve him,"" a fan wrote. Another took a different stance: ""Hate all y’all want! Ye is a monster! This diss was fire!!!""
However, many of the positive reactions to this whole situation center around Ye's involvement in the first place, and less so about the bar work or the shots themselves. For those unaware, Kanye West took aim at Drake's UMG deal, and said that playing J. Cole... well, let's just say he isn't playing his music for his wife Bianca Censori anytime soon. While some people thought these were valid shots, others took issue with this particular bar: ""I can't even think of a Drake line."" This is because of the Toronto superstar and the Chicago creative's history of working together in the past, and how the former wrote the chorus of ""Yikes"" for the latter without receiving any credit.

In addition, many folks thought that this was just a poor-quality or straight-up bad move for Kanye West in the long run, ultimately proving Drake's point about everyone having to unite to beat him. Still, there's one person who is notably absent from many of these discussions, and the one that really ignited this in the first place: Kendrick Lamar. No one really knows the dynamics of how ""Like That"" came about in the first place, but he's kept quiet in the overwhelming aftermath of it. K.Dot's silence might indicate he's working on a bomb, it could threaten his place on the throne, or it's proof that he's the only one who really has the confidence and security to ignore the game's uproar over one effective verse... again. Your call. On that note, check out some ""Like That"" remix reactions down below.

Kanye West: Rapper verprügelt falschen Zwillingsbruder,"Nachdem ein Mann mit Kanyes Frau Bianca Censori zusammengestossen war, wurde dieser laut Insidern handgreiflich. Anscheinend trafen seine Fäuste aber den Falschen.
Darum gehts Am Dienstag hat Kanye West in einem Nobelhotel in Los Angeles laut Insidern einen Mann verprügelt.
Der Rapper wurde handgreiflich, nachdem ein Mann in seine Frau Bianca Censori gestossen war.
Jedoch hat er scheinbar den falschen Zwillingsbruder erwischt.
Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass sich der Rapper Ye (46), besser bekannt als Kanye West, durch mutmassliche Handgreiflichkeiten gegenüber anderen Menschen rechtlichen Ärger einhandelt. In den vergangenen Jahren kam es zu mehreren Anzeigen gegen den Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian (43), weil er angeblich Paparazzi oder Fans mit seinen Fäusten traktierte. Im jüngsten Fall hat der Musiker offensichtlich nicht nur wieder über die Stränge geschlagen, sondern dabei auch noch den falschen Mann erwischt.
Schlägerei im Hotel Chateau Marmont
Wie das Magazin «TMZ» berichtete, kam es am vergangenen Dienstagabend im mondänen Hotel Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles zu einem unschönen und bisher nicht ganz geklärten Vorfall. Insiderquellen des Magazins zufolge soll in der Lobby der Nobelresidenz ein Mann im Vorbeigehen zufällig mit Wests Ehefrau Bianca Censori (29) zusammengestossen sein. Kurz danach sei der Rapper dem Mann nach draussen gefolgt und habe dort zweimal zugeschlagen.
In einem von Kanye Wests Team später veröffentlichten Statement wird der Vorfall jedoch völlig anders dargestellt. Darin heisst es: «Der Angreifer stiess nicht nur mit ihr zusammen. Er hat seine Hände unter ihr Kleid gesteckt, direkt auf ihren Körper, er hat sie an der Taille gepackt, sie herumgewirbelt und ihr dann Küsse zugeworfen. Sie wurde misshandelt und sexuell missbraucht.»
Hörst du die Musik von Ye? Ja, ich finde sie toll. Nur ein paar wenige Lieder. Nein, ich kann sie seit seinen Skandalen nicht mehr hören. Nein, ich mochte sie noch nie.
Bekam Zwillingsbruder Kanye Wests Schläge ab?
In einem weiteren Bericht deckte «TMZ» nun auf, dass der Skandal-Rapper bei seiner Attacke anscheinend gar nicht den mutmasslichen Belästiger, sondern vielmehr dessen Zwillingsbruder vor die Fäuste bekam.
Dem Magazin zufolge handelt es sich bei diesen Zwillingsbrüdern um Mark und Jonnie Houston (45), zwei in Los Angeles bekannte Gastronomen, denen in der Stadt mehrere Clubs und Restaurants gehören. Auch wenn es von den beiden eineiigen Zwillingen bisher noch kein Statement zu dieser skurrilen Verwechslungsgeschichte gibt, sieht «TMZ» den geschilderten Hergang der Ereignisse durch «Quellen der Strafverfolgungsbehörden» jedoch bestätigt.

"Kanye West Teases ""More Coming Tonight,"" Metro Boomin Reacts To His ""Like That"" Remix","Kanye West says he's got ""more coming tonight"" after premiering his new ""Like That"" remix during an interview with Justin Laboy on The Download podcast on Saturday. He made the announcement in the replies to a meme he shared on Twitter which pokes fun at J Cole, who he dissed on the remix to Metro Boomin and Future's hit song. “Y’all so out of sight, out of mind, I can’t even think of a Drake line,"" West rapped. ""Play J. Cole, get the p*ssy dry.”
Additionally, Metro Boomin posted a photo of himself in the studio with Kanye with the caption: ""can’t stop won’t stop."" In the picture, West rocks a Sean Jean tank top while on the song, he raps: ""Can't Stop. Won't Stop. I just f*cked your b*tch in a Sean John tank top.""

Kanye and Drake have had issues with one another for years at this point. Following the release of Kendrick Lamar's verse on the original ""Like That,"" with which he disses Drake, Ye quickly spoke out on the feud. He ranted on Instagram: ""EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED KENDRICK ON NO MORE PARTIES IN LA. EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED DRAKE AT THE FREE HOOVER CONCERT."" Check out his latest posts on Twitter below.
Kanye West Teases New Music
Metro has been collaborating with numerous artists who have had issues with Drake in recent weeks. He also dropped songs with The Weeknd, ASAP Rocky, and more that target the Toronto rapper. Drake responded with the song, ""Push Ups,"" last week. Be on the lookout for further updates on Kanye West on HotNewHipHop.

Ye reportedly punched wrong guy in LA battery incident,"The person allegedly punched by Ye in Los Angeles this week may not have been the rapper’s intended target, according to reports.
The artist formerly known as Kanye West made headlines on Wednesday after reportedly punching a person in the face who he claimed improperly touched his wife, Bianca Censori.
On Saturday, TMZ identified that man as either Mark or Jonnie Houston, twin brothers who own several hot spots in the L.A. area.
But sources told the outlet Ye might have unintentionally punched the wrong twin.
The incident unfolded in the early hours of Wednesday at the famed Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood. The Grammy Award-winning artist, 46, reportedly got physical after a man “allegedly grabbed or pushed” Censori.
Milo Yiannopoulos, chief of staff at Ye’s clothing company Yeezy, later said in a statement shared with NBC News that the man had done more than simply bump into Censori.
“Bianca was physically assaulted,” he said. “The assailant didn’t merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted.”
However, eyewitnesses told TMZ a different version of events, saying the man in question accidentally bumped into Censori in the hotel lobby, which busy at the time. Sources said it “happened quickly,” according to the outlet, and the man went on his way immediately after. He went outside to sit at a table with friends, which reportedly included his twin brother.
Earlier in the day, the “Donda” rapper and Censori were spotted at Disneyland. The 29-year-old Australian model, known for daring outfits, surprised many on social media for being uncharacteristically covered up.",2024-04-20T20:39:36Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News
"Kanye West Disses Drake & J. Cole On Alleged ""Like That"" Remix Leaked By Adam22: Listen","As if hip-hop's civil war wasn't controversial enough, it looks like Kanye West has allegedly, supposedly, and maybe picked a side in all this. Moreover, there's a new leak spreading around the Internet of his verse on a ""Like That"" remix, the song from Future, Metro Boomin, and of course Kendrick Lamar that fully kicked the K.Dot versus Drake war (plus many others) into full gear. In fact, you may remember that just yesterday at press time (Friday, April 19), Adam22 claimed to have the remix in his possession and that he was barred from leaking it, something he seemingly ignored by posting the verse online. Here's what Ye supposedly had to say about the beef: ""Y'all so out of sight, out of mind / I can't even think of a Drake line / Play J. Cole, get the p***y dry.""
Furthermore, we say ""allegedly"" because the obvious question is whether or not this Kanye West verse is A.I.-generated or not, something that fans seem very split about online. Of course, Drake kind of took advantage of the whole A.I. discussion debacle by using the voices of Tupac and Snoop Dogg to taunt Kendrick Lamar on ""Taylor Made Freestyle."" Needless to say, this technology proved itself to be quite the dangerous tool in this feud, something we all should've known already. But things took an even wilder turn when Adam22 posted the alleged final version of this Ye remix with revamped production, a new Future verse, and no Kendrick at all.

In addition, this supposed diss is interesting (if real) given Kanye West's thoughts on the whole beef back when ""Like That"" first dropped. ""EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED KENDRICK ON NO MORE PARTIES IN LA, EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED DRAKE AT THE FREE HOOVER CONCERT,"" Ye shared on IG. ""EVERYONE KNOWS I BROUGHT ADIDAS INTO THIS CULTURE AND I TOOK THEM OUT, EVERYONE KNOWS LOTTA DEMNA VIRGIL JERRY KIM ALL WORKED FOR ME. I MADE YEEZUS DARK FANTASY PABLO GRADUATION THRONE 808S, I MADE RUNAWAY DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS FATHER STRETCH. I AM THE ONLY PERSON TO COME BACK TO NUMBER ONE AFTER CANCELLATION. THERE IS ONLY ONE GOAT. I STAND BY ME. MY FRIENDS CALL ME YE :).""
Adam22 Posts Alleged Final Version Of Ye's ""Like That"" Remix With New Future Verse & No Kendrick Lamar Verse
However, if this remix is indeed real and gets a release and approval by at least one of its original collaborators, then it will be clear what side the Yeezy mogul is on. But as with most things Ye-related these days, he wove a very complicated web. After all, he's apparently dealing with a battery assault investigation right now which might have him pretty distracted. With this supposed full remix of ""Like That"" on the cards, this is getting much wilder than most of us could've predicted. Either way, for the latest updates on Kanye West, Drake, J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and this whole situation, stay up to date on HNHH.

Kanye West and Bianca Censori are planning their attention-grabbing public outing to stay in the limelight, claimed an entertainment journalist.
In a conversation with The Mirror, Jeannie Assimos, the former Managing Editor of Entertainment Tonight, claimed that the rapper is ""obsessed with the media attention.""
Since marrying the Australian beauty, Kanye made it to the negative headlines due to his wife's racy outfit choices and his attitude towards the media.
Jeannie believes that ""Bianca and Ye's outings are to continue the mystique and create continued interest in his brand.""
The expert called their controversial outings ""fully orchestrated."" She added, ""Ye seems to be building a very bizarre brand, and at this point, it's almost like a trainwreck that the public can't stop watching.""
She explained, ""But would they buy anything from him at this point? Big brands he had former associations with don't think so.""
Speaking of TV host Bill Maher, Jeannie shared that he ""even recently refused to air a podcast interview with Ye because he didn't want to perpetuate anti-semitic comments from the rapper.""",2024-04-20T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Ryan Garcia Walkout Song: Is Kanye ‘Ye’ West Walking Him Out Against Devin Haney?,"LAS VEGAS, NV – APRIL 18 – Ryan Garcia at the Gervonta Davis vs Ryan Garcia Grand Arrival at the MGM GRAND in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 18, 2023 ahead of their fight this coming weekend. PUBLICATIONxNOTxINxUSA Copyright: xDeeCeexCarterx
Ryan Garcia and Devin Haney are about to square off against each other in less than 12 hours. Will Devin Haney be able to put a stop to Garcia’s newfound personality? After a chaotic weigh-in, Garcia brought an advantage for himself by being 3 pounds heavier than his opponent. As a result, Garcia isn’t eligible to hold the WBC belt on his shoulders anymore even if he manages to win against Devin Haney today. Does that make the event less exciting? Not if Garcia has any say in it.
Since Garcia came in and weighed 143.2 lbs, both parties had to sit down and devise a way to make the fight happen. Garcia even had to pay off Devin Haney for losing the bet they made during their event presser. But that doesn’t matter much to Garcia as per one of his tweets. He’s loaded, as he says. That is perhaps the reason he is looking to make an entry unlike anyone else during the fight tonight. In fact, now the fans wonder which artist will be accompanying KingRy during his walkout. Can fans expect Kanye West tonight?
Ryan Garcia’s last walkout featuring a famous rapper!

Before a boxer is in the center of the ring in his stance with gloves up on his face, he tries to make a mark through his entrance. There are many boxers whose entrances are as iconic as their fight. Coming into this list are Canelo Alvarez, Tyson Fury, and Deontay Wilder among many other greats. Also, other great artists have been invited to perform their live walkout music, this has been done by Terence Crawford, Gervonta Davis, and even the star-in-question, Ryan Garcia.

So who did Garcia invite? The legendary rapper, Lupe Fiasco, in his previous fight against Oscar Duarte. Garcia donned a blue robe, that had ‘Heart of Fire’ written on its back, and greeted the rapper before walking out to the ring. Fiasco was the only one who accompanied the boxer to the ring, while performing his superhit music, ‘Superstar’. Interestingly, this song was also recently used by Sean O’Malley in his walkout at the UFC 299 main event on 9th March.
This is an interesting fact since there’s somewhat of a feud ongoing between O’Malley and Garcia for a crossover UFC fight. So, this could also be a subtle jab at Garcia even or it could just be a coincidence. Who can say? Garcia’s walkout in one of his biggest fights against Gervonta Davis isn’t also something that can be forgotten.
What song did Ryan Garcia walk out to in his fight against Gervonta Davis?
Back in April 2023, the fans were excited to witness the much-awaited fight between the two lightweight stars Ryan Garcia and Gervonta Davis. Even though it wasn’t a title fight, it still became one of the most important fights last year. Right before any of the stars entered the ring, amidst all the cheers and ruckus, fans were caught off guard by the worship music getting played out of nowhere. Well, it was Ryan Garcia’s walkout music.
Even though his opponent later followed him with the famous rap song ‘Love Sosa’ by Chief Keef, Garcia’s choice was definitely surprising. He walked out to Hillsong UNITED’s ‘Oceans (Where Feet May Fall)’. Garcia has always been vocal about his faith in Christianity, and how it has always refrained him from getting distracted off his true path.
But the fans are interested in the clash about to take place tonight. How will Ryan Garcia make his entrance and set the theme for the main event?
Ryan Garcia’s next walkout song: What did he say about Kanye ‘Ye’ West?
ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad
Ryan Garcia and Kanye West could be seen together on the fight night, at least that’s what ‘KingRy’ confirmed. At first, Garcia claimed that ‘Ye’ declined his offer to walk him out due to one of his posts that stated ‘No Diddy’. So, after West’s decline, Garcia went on a tirade against the rapper in a series of now-deleted tweets.
Garcia was talking about the post when he offered 50 Cent to walk him out through X, where he wrote, “@50cent would be awesome if you walked out with me 4-20. No diddy. Let’s do this!!!!” However, 50 Cent didn’t respond, which left Garcia in a lurch. Things did not stay the same. Only a week later, out of the blue, Garcia wrote, “Kanye walking me out. You heard it here first/ Big money let’s go.”
Now it is to be noted that this could very well be another one of his erratic posts without much substance in it. Much recently, during the weigh-in, Garcia walked out with a beer bottle in his hands while he was being measured on the scale. He even chugged it. To Ariel Helwani, who asked him what he was drinking, he even replied, “I was drinking a nice a** beer. That shit was fire.”

However, later in his tweets, Garcia clearly mentioned that it was just apple and cranberry juice. So, this very well could just be another one of his random posts. But you never know. Maybe chances are we may get to see Kanye West rock at Barclays Center during Garcia’s ring walk.
So, the only way to find out for sure is for fans to tune in for the event at 11 p.m. ET. Do you believe Garcia’s claim about Kanye West? Will we see him there tonight? Tell us what you think in the comments below!",2024-04-20T18:02:57Z,https://www.essentiallysports.com,Essentially Sports

Kurz danach sei der Rapper dem Mann nach draussen gefolgt und habe dort zweimal zugeschlagen.
In einem von Kanye Wests Team später veröffentlichten Statement wird der Vorfall jedoch völlig anders dargestellt. Darin heisst es: ""Der Angreifer stiess nicht nur mit ihr zusammen. Er hat seine Hände unter ihr Kleid gesteckt, direkt auf ihren Körper, er hat sie an der Taille gepackt, sie herumgewirbelt und ihr dann Küsse zugeworfen. Sie wurde misshandelt und sexuell missbraucht.""
Bekam Zwillingsbruder Kanye Wests Schläge ab?
In einem weiteren Bericht deckte ""TMZ"" nun am heutigen 20. April auf, dass der Skandal-Rapper bei seiner Attacke anscheinend gar nicht den mutmasslichen Belästiger, sondern vielmehr dessen Zwillingsbruder vor die Fäuste bekam. Dem Magazin zufolge handelt es bei diesen Zwillingsbrüdern um Mark und Jonnie Houston (45), zwei in Los Angeles bekannte Gastronomen, denen in der Stadt mehrere Clubs und Restaurants gehören. Auch wenn es von den beiden eineiigen Zwillingen bisher noch kein Statement zu dieser skurrilen Verwechslungsgeschichte gibt, sieht ""TMZ"" den geschilderten Hergang der Ereignisse durch ""Quellen der Strafverfolgungsbehörden"" jedoch bestätigt.

Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass sich der Rapper Ye (46), besser bekannt als Kanye West , durch mutmaßliche Handgreiflichkeiten gegenüber anderen Menschen rechtlichen Ärger einhandelt. In den vergangenen Jahren kam es zu mehreren Anzeigen gegen den Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian (43), weil er angeblich Paparazzi oder Fans mit seinen Fäusten traktierte. Im jüngsten Fall hat der Musiker offensichtlich nicht nur wieder über die Stränge geschlagen, sondern dabei auch noch den falschen Mann erwischt.

Kanye West Battery Assault: Ye Allegedly Hit The Wrong Twin After Sexual Assault Accusation,"New allegations and claims are emerging surrounding the reported investigation that the Los Angeles Police Department is conducting on Kanye West for his role in an alleged battery assault. For those unaware, he allegedly punched a man who he accused of sexually assaulting his wife Bianca Censori at the Chateau Marmont hotel in L.A earlier this week. However, TMZ recently reported that, according to supposed eyewitnesses that reportedly spoke to the publication, this situation was actually different to what initially emerged from coverage. Specifically, the man that the Chicago artist allegedly punched has a twin brother (they're reportedly Mark and Jonnie Houston), with whom he runs a couple of restaurants and celebrity hotspots in the area, and he is accused of punching the wrong one.
Moreover, this is how this new TMZ report's story goes. According to their supposed eyewitnesses, one of the twins bumped into Bianca Censori accidentally in the busy hotel lobby, but that they quickly moved apart and kept going about their business. The man allegedly went out to a table to sit with colleagues, and these reports accuse Kanye West of going to them to confront whoever supposedly assaulted his wife. This is when he allegedly punched the man in the face, but according to these unconfirmed reports, he apparently punched the wrong man, striking his twin brother who was also at the table instead.

Furthermore, these reports do not specify via proof or claims whether it was Mark or Jonnie Houston that stands accused of sexually assaulting Bianca Censori. It's also unclear which one allegedly bumped into her according to this recent TMZ report, or who was the one that Kanye West supposedly punched. The brothers reportedly own Black Rabbit Rose, Break Room 86, No Vacancy, and other venues and restaurants in addition to being Chateau frequenters. According to these alleged sources and other reports, Ye left after this incident, and that's when police reportedly arrived to try to talk to him about it.
Meanwhile, the couple's team continues to allege that this was sexual assault against Bianca on behalf of one of these brothers. This case will reportedly be sent to the City Attorney for review according to TMZ, and there is allegedly no evidence to support either side of the narrative at press time. We'll see if the two react or say anything about these allegations in the public eye, and where the reported investigation will go.

Dance giants Justice return: ‘The only thing we argued over were the bongos’,"Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Augé are sitting in their record company’s London office, both wearing sunglasses and vaping heavily. De Rosnay is in an immaculately pressed denim jacket with a delicate neck scarf, while Augé, with his huge head of curls, dark glasses and thick moustache, recalls prime-era Giorgio Moroder. If it wasn’t for the fact they have vapes rather than cigarettes between their lips, this could be a scene plucked right out of the 1970s. Which isn’t unusual terrain for the French duo Justice, happy as they are to pilfer retro influences to make futuristic and genre-twisting electronic music.
However, for their latest album, Hyperdrama, they wanted to approach things with a bit of a “reset”: seeking to offset expectations and challenge themselves. “Being free from preconceptions was a big part of this record,” says De Rosnay. “To think less and just go more by feeling – to be more spontaneous.”
The pair speak slowly and thoughtfully. They are not exactly subdued or detached, but do radiate a reserved stillness, with De Rosnay by far the more talkative. There is little interaction between them but each gracefully steps out of the way when the other talks, and you get the sense of an intuitive understanding. “The only thing we argued about for this album was some bongos on one track,” says Augé, shaking his head at the painful memory that it was even suggested.
“I still think it would have been better with them,” De Rosnay pings back with a smirk.
We’ve been lucky: our first album put us in a space where we didn’t have to worry about releasing music to make a living Xavier de Rosnay
A single argument over percussion for a whole album is not bad going. Not least because their new record contains plenty of room for disagreement, shifting from slick house to searing electro, strutting disco to infectious pop, via touches of everything from suave R&B to pummelling techno and chopped-up hip-hop. “We love a lot of very monomaniacal records but we also like diversity and being larger than life,” says Augé. “And we try to make all these influences coexist.”
One of the components that has always made Justice such a potent outfit is this genre-fluid approach, as well a hellbent perseverance to “make the most dramatic music possible”. Equally inspired by heavy metal as they are Italo disco, they possess an inherent understanding of the power of the riff, but filtered through an electronic lens. This applies aesthetically too, from their prog rock-esque cross logo (which Justin Bieber was accused of stealing for his 2021 album Justice), to their outfits of leather jackets and vintage band T-shirts.
They have always looked like 1970s rockers and have had a good run living out that life, too. Their 2008 tour documentary A Cross the Universe features parties, fights, arrests and even a drunken wedding between Augé and a fan – done seemingly just for an impulsive laugh. While the hard rock influence may be less apparent on Hyperdrama, tracks such as the grubby, grinding Generator still show their ability to create something monstrous and thundering.
Justice have been doing this for a good 20 years now, ever since the then graphic designers remixed the electro-house track Never Be Alone by Simian in 2003, resulting in We Are Your Friends. The infectious anthem quickly became one of the defining crossover dance hits of the decade, and helped cement the newly formed Ed Banger records as one of the most hip and influential labels of the ensuing decade, home to the likes of SebastiAn, Uffie, Mr Oizo and Cassius. Justice also found themselves in high demand, remixing everyone from U2 to Britney Spears.
They even got a taste of Kanye West’s ire two years before Taylor Swift, when West stormed the stage at the 2006 MTV Europe Music awards in protest at Justice winning best video for We Are Your Friends. “Ah, hell no,” West grumbled. “If I don’t win, the awards show loses credibility.” Ironically, two years later, West premiered the Romain Gavras-directed video for the band’s song Stress on his website. The video was controversial: in depicting black youths committing gang violence across Paris it was accused by some as having a racist message (which the pair strenuously denied).
Before they knew it, Justice were being touted as the next Daft Punk. That, on one hand, made sense: they were an electronic French duo who also (at the time) shared the same manager. But, as the pair pointed out themselves, there were “so many differences” and plenty of “nonsense comparisons”. Daft Punk made sleek, shiny, club-based music, whereas Justice embraced grit, grease and graininess. Tracks such as the crunching Waters of Nazareth remain to this day outrageously filthy pieces of music.
Justice’s hugely successful debut album, Cross, attracted the ire of dance music purists, many of whom recoiled at its maximalist French house-meets-stadium rock bombastic blowout. But it was gobbled up by a new generation of fans during an era when the dance and rock music worlds were blurring, and even punctured the mainstream by picking up three Grammy nominations (Justice have since won two).
However, for a duo who were once so intertwined with the musical zeitgeist of an era, nearly two decades down the line they seem strangely at ease with their declining influence. “We don’t run after hits,” says De Rosnay. “By the time we finish producing an album, we’re already too late to be concerned about being out of fashion.”

Late is an understatement: Hyperdrama arrives eight years after their last album, Woman. So why the slow-burn approach? “The anachronistic appeal of making long-format albums is something we really love,” says De Rosnay. “How many thousands of records are out every day? We would feel bad making things for the sake of it. We don’t want to be part of the oversaturation of content.”
The pair also don’t want their entire existence to just be Justice. “We want a life,” De Rosnay says. “You can spend your life making dozens of records but what does it get you at the end of it? Yes, eight years is a long time between two records, but we don’t feel it necessary to have a bigger output than this.” Augé released a debut solo album, Escapades, in 2021. “The great thing about taking time is you have something new to bring to the dynamic of the duo and so it’s never boring,” he says.
If spending the best part of a decade on a record sounds like a hugely privileged position to be in, the band are keenly aware of that. “We’ve been very lucky,” says De Rosnay. “It’s a one-in-a-million chance that our first single, our first song ever, got us to a point where we could make an album and then that album put us in a space where we didn’t have to worry too much about releasing music to make a living. That’s huge luck. We have pure freedom on every level and we are very grateful for that.”
We get requests from pop artists asking for precisely our mid-2000s type of music, but this is not something we want to do Xavier de Rosnay
On this occasion that pure freedom led to an album rooted in collaboration and exploration. The record features Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, Thundercat, Miguel and Connan Mockasin. But these are not half-baked vocals sent over via a computer, as is commonplace with a lot of guest appearances these days. Instead, the guests were embedded “as a band” into the creative process from the very early demo stages and they were always in the room. “Remote collaborations sound less fluid,” says Augé.
While the relationship between man and machine is at the heart of all electronic music, Justice really lean into this on Hyperdrama, switching back and forth on the same track between music played by a person and being computer-generated. Tracks such as Incognito unfold via rich, warm synths that sound straight out of a 1970s analogue studio before leaping forward a decade into a pulsing, driving machine chug. “We go back and forth between those two universes,” says De Rosnay.
For a band who have always been associated with creating forward-looking music from rearview influences, they are now entering a time when their own music is entering the 20-year nostalgia cycle. “The same amount of time has now passed since We Are Your Friends came out as since Blue Monday when we made it,” De Rosnay says, his eyes widening in astonishment. “We hear more stuff now that sounds like what we used to do in the mid-2000s, and we get requests from pop artists asking for precisely this type of music, but this is not something we want to do.”
How come? “We wouldn’t be able to do it,” he says. “It was made with the energy of people in their 20s [he and Augé are both now in their early 40s]. We were completely devoid of knowledge, got a computer and made our first album. This is impossible to recreate. We’re happy making people unhappy by not giving them what they want and just doing things that seem natural to us.”
However, while Justice have no interest in trying to resurrect an earlier version of themselves, they do try to cling on to a little of the naivety that sparked their rapid ascent by trusting gut feeling above learned knowledge. “We’re afraid of knowing too much,” De Rosnay says. “It’s like knowing how to perform a magic trick – it loses everything.”",2024-04-20T10:55:24Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
le jour où l'artiste féminine la plus puissante de l'industrie musicale a failli arrêter sa carrière,"Devenue l'artiste la plus écoutée dans le monde, Taylor Swift a pourtant bien failli arrêter sa carrière en 2016, à la suite d'un clash avec le rappeur Kanye West. Une épreuve que la pop star a su dépasser et retourner à son avantage.
Après une année de tous les records, rien ne peut arrêter le ""phénomène Taylor Swift"". La superstar américaine, devenue récemment milliardaire grâce à sa tournée mondiale ""The Eras Tour"", vient de sortir le 19 avril un nouvel album, The Tortured Poets Department, déjà assuré d’être en tête des classements. Pourtant, il y a quelques années, peu de professionnels de la musique auraient misé sur un tel succès. Alors qu'elle commençait à se faire un nom dans le métier, la jeune chanteuse a vécu un événement dont les conséquences auraient pu mettre fin à sa carrière.
En septembre 2009, Taylor Swift est heureuse. A 20 ans, la jeune artiste de pop country vient de recevoir, devant un parterre de stars, le prix du clip de l’année aux MTV Vidéos Music Awards. Sur la scène du Radio City Music Hall de New York, elle commence à remercier ses parents et son producteur quand Kanye West, qui est à l’époque l’un des plus grands rappeurs américains, l’interrompt et lui prend le micro des mains. ""Je suis très heureux pour toi et je vais te laisser finir, mais Beyoncé a fait le meilleur clip de tous les temps"", lance-t-il devant un public médusé et une Beyoncé gênée. Après son esclandre, le rappeur sort de scène, laissant la jeune chanteuse hébétée et humiliée.
Taylor Swift disparaît pendant un an
Plus tard, sous la pression médiatique, Kanye West présente ses excuses mais en 2016, il réitère ses provocations. Dans le clip de son titre Famous, il est allongé dans un lit entouré de célébrités nues, dont le sosie de Taylor Swift. Les images défilent et les paroles du rappeur sont sans équivoque : ""Je pourrai toujours coucher avec Taylor, j’ai rendu cette salope célèbre."" La vidéo fait scandale et pour se justifier, Kanye West assure publiquement que la chanteuse lui a donné l’autorisation d’utiliser son nom et son image dans le clip.
Alors que la pop star nie, Kim Kardashian, à l’époque la femme du rappeur, publie sur Internet l'extrait d’une conversation téléphonique entre les deux stars de la musique discutant de certains détails de la vidéo. Le public se retourne aussitôt contre Taylor Swift et la petite fiancée de l’Amérique apparaît comme une manipulatrice et une menteuse. Du jour au lendemain, la chanteuse disparaît et ferme son compte Instagram.
Son coup de maître marque le tournant de sa carrière
Ce n’est qu’un an plus tard, en 2017, que Taylor Swift revient, mais ce n’est plus la même. Habillée de noir et maquillée d’un épais trait d’eye-liner, la star compte bien reprendre le contrôle de sa carrière. Dans le clip de Look What You Made Me Do, elle enterre la jeune Taylor ingénue pour faire sortir de terre une Taylor combative qui veut rétablir la vérité, et chante ""Je serai l’actrice principale de tes cauchemars"".
En 2019, la chanteuse plus déterminée que jamais va plus loin : lorsqu’elle apprend qu’un producteur proche de Kanye West a racheté les droits de ses six premiers albums, elle décide de les réenregistrer avec la mention ""Taylor’s Version"". Et les fans jouent le jeu, ils rachètent les albums, la réédition de 1989 (Taylor’s Version) battra même son propre record de vente en moins d’une semaine. Pour Mathilde Serrell, journaliste à France Inter, cette décision marque un tournant dans sa carrière : ""C’est quelque chose qui va fédérer un nouveau public, engranger des revenus supplémentaires, elle rentre dans l’histoire avec ce coup-là"".
Aujourd’hui, Taylor Swift est devenue l’artiste la plus puissante de l’industrie musicale. Et même si elle a réussi à transcender les épreuves, elle a avoué, en décembre 2023 dans une interview accordée au magazine Time, qui l’a sacrée personnalité de l’année, que cet épisode a eu de lourdes répercussions sur sa santé mentale : "" Cela m'a fait tomber psychologiquement dans un endroit où je n'avais jamais été auparavant. J'ai déménagé dans un pays étranger. Je n'ai pas quitté une maison de location pendant un an. J'avais peur de téléphoner. J'ai repoussé la plupart des gens dans ma vie parce que je ne faisais plus confiance à personne. J'ai sombré très, très durement.""

"Kanye West’s Remix Of Future, Metro Boomin & Kendrick Lamar's ""Like That"" Is Allegedly In Adam22’s Hands","It goes without saying that the release of Future and Metro Boomin's track with Kendrick Lamar, ""Like That,"" has sparked a lot of controversy. On his verse, Kendrick took aim at both Drake and J. Cole, which has since resulted in response disses from both of them. Almost everyone has chimed in on the matter at this point, including No Jumper's Adam22, albeit in his own way.
Today, the podcaster took to Twitter/X to announce that he's got something incredibly valuable in his possession. It's to be noted, however, that it's unclear whether or not it actually exists. According to him, it's Kanye West's remix of ""Like That,"" which he also says he's been ""forbidden"" to leak. Check out his Tweet below.

Adam22 Claims He's Been ""Forbidden"" To Leak Alleged Remix
""I have the Kanye 'like that' remix,"" he wrote simply. ""I have been forbidden to leak it at this time."" While plenty of commenters are calling cap on Adam's claim, others think he might be telling the truth, and are urging him to drop it. Only time will tell whether or not he's being honest, or just messing with his followers amid the viral feud the song sparked.
This isn't the only time Adam22 inserted himself into the debacle, however. He also entered the chat about the real ""big three"" rappers prompted by Kendrick's ""it's just big me"" claim, revealing who he believes are the big three of hip-hop media. According to him, it's himself, DJ Vlad, and DJ Akademiks. As expected, Joe Budden disagreed, and apparently Drake does too. According to Adam, Drizzy DMd him and told him he's ""got to give it to"" Budden over Vlad. What do you think of Adam22 claiming to have Kanye West's alleged remix of Future, Metro Boomin, and Kendrick Lamar's ""Like That""? Do you believe him?

Unangemessen? Bianca Censori im sexy Look im Disneyland!,"Bianca Censoris (29) Outfit sorgt mal wieder für Schlagzeilen! Vergangenen Dienstag besuchte die Australierin mit ihrem Mann Kanye West (46) das Disneyland in Los Angeles – und zwar in einem ziemlich freizügigen Look. Wie Fotos, die Mirror vorliegen, zeigen, trug sie einen beigefarbenen Mini-Jumpsuit, über dem auf der vorderen Seite eine Stoffbahn drapiert war. Ihre Rückseite schien nur von dem engen Overall verdeckt zu werden. Dazu kombinierte sie lediglich dünne Socken, aus denen ihre Zehen hervorschauten. Schuhe hatte sie keine an. Ehemann Kanye war hingegen deutlich sportlicher und bedeckter unterwegs: Er lief in einem weißen Sportanzug durch den Freizeitpark.
Dass Bianca sich gerne in sehr knappen Looks zeigt, ist keine Neuheit. Doch mit diesem Auftritt sorgt sie jetzt für besonders viel Aufregungen unter den Fans. ""Gibt es im Disneyland keinen Dresscode?"", ""Sie haben sie so reingelassen?"" und ""Normalos könnten das nicht in dem Freizeitpark tragen!"", lauten nur ein paar der schockierten Kommentare auf Instagram. Einige User kritisierten auch, dass andere Besucher bei so einem Outfit rausgeschmissen werden würden oder sich etwas überziehen müssten.
Angeblich sollen diese freizügigen Styles nicht nur von Biancas Seite kommen – vor allem Kanye soll der Grund dafür sein. Die Körpersprache-Expertin Judi James schilderte gegenüber Mirror, dass der ""Stronger""-Interpret seine Ex-Frau Kim Kardashian (43) so provozieren wolle. Diese Looks sollen wohl darstellen, dass Kanye ""eine Version von [Kim] gefunden hat, die ihn vergöttert, die genauso schön ist und die sich gerne so kleidet und verhält, wie er es will.""

"Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Feud: A Timeline","View gallery
Taylor Swift and Kanye West’s rivalry has been one of the biggest in music history. From the infamous 2009 VMAs incident to their short-lived friendship to Kanye’s shoutout on “Famous” and Taylor’s response on reputation, it’s certainly been one for the history books. Taylor recently reflected on the feud and Kanye’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian leaking the 2016 phone call about “Famous” in her Time “Person of the Year” interview.
As one of the longest-running rivalries in music, tons of fans revisit the drama when one of them do something to stir the pot. With Taylor reflecting on the phone call and her career as a whole, look back on the entire timeline of their feud here.
The 2009 MTV VMAs
The trouble started between Taylor and Kanye in 2009, years before Kim was in the picture. No one will ever forget the infamous moment when Kanye stormed the stage at the 2009 Video Music Awards and interrupted Taylor while she was accepting the award for Female Video of the Year. He ran on-stage and announced that Beyoncé had “one of the best videos of all time.” In subsequent interviews, Taylor did reveal that Kanye had called her to apologize after the fact.
Taylor was just 19 years old at the time, and the situation publicly humiliated her. When Bey was given the Video of the Year award, she welcomed Taylor back to the stage to have her moment. In the years since the infamous incident, Taylor has referred to it on multiple occasions, including during a performance on her “Eras Tour” in August 2023.
Taylor Releases “Innocent,” and Kanye Drops “Runaway”
After the incident, the Speak Now singer responded by penning the song “Innocent” on her 2010 album and performing it at the very same award show one year after the incident. The song was not angry, and although Taylor and Kanye were far from friends, it looked like they were putting the drama behind them.
At the 2010 award show, Kanye also made his return with the song “Runaway” from his magnum opus album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. The performance not only marked the beginning of the promo for the album, but the song appeared at least partially inspired by the backlash he received for the incident.
Taylor & Kanye Hang Out at the Grammys
In 2015, they proved that all was cool between them by hanging out at the 2015 Grammy Awards. JAY-Z helped facilitate the reconciliation, as he was friends with both Kanye AND Taylor. In August of that year, Taylor spoke about the two of them making up in a Vanity Fair interview. “I feel like I wasn’t ready to be friends with him until I felt like he had some sort of respect for me, and he wasn’t ready to be friends with me until he had some sort of respect for me,” she said. “Hey, I like him as a person. And that’s a really good, nice first step, a nice place for us to be.”
Taylor Introduces Kanye at the VMAs
At the 2015 VMA Awards that August, Taylor and Kanye’s relationship came full circle, as she presented him with the Video Vanguard Award at the show. She then stood beside Kim in the audience and watched him speak and perform. Unfortunately, the solace was short-lived.
Kanye Releases “Famous,” & Taylor Claps Back
In 2016, Kanye released his song “Famous,” which included the lyric, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex, why? I made that b**** famous.” He claimed that he called Taylor to get her approval for the lyric before releasing the song, but her publicist released a statement that told a different story. She admitted that Kanye did give Taylor a call, but said Taylor never approved the lyric that was in the song that the rapper released.
When Taylor won the 2016 Grammy for Album of the Year, she again made a dig at Kanye and the song. “I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame,” she said, via People. “f you just focus on the work, and you don’t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you’re going, you’ll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world.”
Kim Kardashian Calls Out Taylor & Releases Phone Call Footage
That June, Kim did an interview with GQ, and branded Taylor a liar. Then, in July, she called Taylor a ‘snake’ on X (formerly Twitter), and released illegally-recorded footage of Kanye and Taylor’s conversation about “Famous” on Snapchat.
Taylor released a scathing statement in response through a spokesperson. “Taylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West. However, that does not change the fact that much of what Kim is saying is incorrect. Kanye West and Taylor only spoke once on the phone while she was on vacation with her family in January of 2016 and they have never spoken since. Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do,” they said.
Taylor Drops ‘reputation’
After the Midnights songwriter released her statement, she was shunned on social media, and she retreated from the public eye. She didn’t address the situation again until the release of her 2017 song, “Look What You Made Me Do.” She subsequently released the album reputation, which had a few songs that appeared to take digs at Ye, including “I Did Something Bad” and “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things.”
Taylor Opens Up About Kanye to ‘Rolling Stone’
During a 2019 interview with Rolling Stone, Taylor gave a more detailed account of why she never fully trusted Kanye, even when they were friends. She shared specific instances where she felt manipulated by the rapper, including before presenting him with the Vanguard Award. “I realized he is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk s**t. And I was so upset. He wanted me to come talk to him after the event in his dressing room. I wouldn’t go,” she said.
The Whole Phone Call Is Released
The whole thing was seemingly put to bed — until the FULL version of the “Famous” phone call was leaked in 2020. Taylor released a statement showing that she felt vindicated by the release. “Instead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years),” she wrote.
After Taylor’s statement, Kim clapped back at her, referring to the many people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and she also claimed that she “never edited” the footage. “@taylorswift13 has chosen to reignite an old exchange – that at this point in time feels very self-serving given the suffering millions of real victims are facing right now,” she wrote on X. “At the time when they spoke the song had not been fully written yet, but as everyone can see in the video, she manipulated the truth of their actual conversation in her statement when her team said she ‘declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message.”
Kanye Promises to Get Taylor’s Masters Back
Since “Famous,” Taylor and Kanye have never made up, but amid her battle to regain ownership of her master recordings from Scooter Braun, the rapper did post that he was “GOING TO PERSONALLY SEE TO IT THAT TAYLOR SWIFT GETS HER MASTERS BACK” in a post on X in September 2020. He stood by the statement in an interview with Billboard a few days later. “All artists need to be free and own their rights. Taylor Swift deserves that, just like everyone else,” he said.
Kim Listens to Taylor Years After Feud
In 2021, Kim filed for divorce from Kanye. Taylor didn’t publicly comment on their split, but afterwards, the SKIMs founder did reveal some surprising musical preferences. Kim admitted that she is a fan of Taylor’s music in an interview with political commentator Bari Weiss. “They’re all super cute and catchy,” she said.
Two years later, Kim further showed that she’s a fan by dancing along with her daughter North West in January 2023. In March, she also posted a video of herself working out to the Lover cut “You Need to Calm Down.”
Taylor Looks Back on the Infamous Phone Call in ‘Time’ Interview.
Over seven years after the “Famous” phone call was released, Taylor reflected on the situation more in her Time interview, when she was named “Person of the Year.” She spoke about how down she felt after everyone called her out following Kim’s leak. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before,” she said. “I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”
Taylor Releases ‘thanK you aIMee’ & More From ‘TTPD’
Im April 2024, Taylor released her double album, The Tortured Poets Department, and Swifties were convinced that it included multiple jabs at Kim and Kanye. In the track, “thanK you aIMee,” the lyrics point to a person that bullied Taylor. Not only that, but the title even spells out Kim’s name in the three capitalized letters.",2024-04-19T18:00:26Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
Kanye West accusé d'avoir frappé un homme,"Le rappeur aurait défendu sa compagne qui aurait été «physiquement agressée».
La scène s'est déroulée à l'hôtel Chateau Marmont, à Hollywood. GC Images
Kanye West est de nouveau impliqué dans une altercation. Le rappeur de «Stronger», également connu sous le nom de Ye, est suspecté dans une affaire de violence, d'après TMZ. Des sources policières ont confié au média que les forces de l'ordre enquêtaient sur des accusations portées contre l'artiste, alléguant qu'il aurait frappé un homme au visage. La raison? L'individu aurait apparemment «agrippé ou poussé» sa compagne, Bianca Censori, à Hollywood, tard mardi soir.
«Il a mis ses mains sous sa robe»
Un porte-parole de Kanye West, sans évoquer directement les actes violents du rappeur, a affirmé que Bianca Censori avait été «physiquement et sexuellement agressée» par cet individu dont le nom n'est pas révélé. Il a précisé: «Le mot «agrippé» est vraiment inadéquat pour décrire ce qui s'est passé. Bianca a été physiquement agressée. L'agresseur ne s'est pas contenté de la bousculer. Il a mis ses mains sous sa robe, directement sur son corps, l'a agrippée par la taille, l'a fait tournoyer, puis lui a envoyé des baisers. Elle a été agressée physiquement et sexuellement.»
Après l'incident survenu à l'hôtel Chateau Marmont à Hollywood, Kanye West et Bianca Censori ont apparemment quitté les lieux. La victime présumée n'a pas eu besoin de soins médicaux pour ses blessures.
À 46 ans, Kanye West a déjà été au centre d'enquêtes pour violences par le passé. L'année dernière, il a été accusé d'avoir arraché et jeté le téléphone d'un photographe, et en 2022, d'avoir frappé un chasseur d'autographes. Aucune inculpation n'a été prononcée à son encontre pour ces incidents.",2024-04-19T17:14:25Z,https://www.lematin.ch,Le Matin

Keeping up with Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian’s feud is no easy feat.
The Grammy-winning singer and the reality star have been at odds since 2016 — and Swift fanned the flames of their feud with her 2024 album, “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.”
Before they began butting heads, however, Kardashian shared her “love” of the pop superstar with “Entertainment Tonight” in 2009 and called herself the “biggest fan.”

Three years later, the duo posed for smiling snaps together at the MTV Video Music Awards. They did the same at the 2015 awards ceremony, even hugging at the Grammys that year.
Their friendship seemed unlikely, as Kardashian’s then-husband, Kanye West, infamously interrupted Swift’s acceptance speech during the 2009 VMAs.
Now that Swift and Kardashian are on the outs again, Page Six is breaking down their nearly decade-long dispute.

West rapped that he “might still have sex” with Swift and “made that bitch famous” in his February 2016 song “Famous” — and when she took issue with the lyrics, Kardashian stepped into the scandal.
The “Kardashians” star claimed in June 2016 that West had followed “proper protocol” and got “approval” from Swift, telling GQ, “She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn’t.”
Kardashian went on to shade the singer on social media, and her fans followed suit with snake emojis.
Swift’s rep subsequently called “much of” Kardashian’s comment “incorrect.”
The spokesperson clarified, “Taylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian, as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West.”

The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum explained why she “wanted to defend” West in a July 2016 episode of her family’s E! reality show.
“I never talk s–t about anyone publicly, especially in interviews,” she said. “But I … had so had it.”
When Kris Jenner nudged her daughter to call Swift and apologize, Kardashian replied, “Thank you for your lovely advice, but I’m not going to take it.”
The Skims creator went on to publicly release clips from West’s phone call with Swift via Snapchat, with the “Shake It Off” singer calling the “sex” line a “compliment.”

“If people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘He called me and told me before it came out. … Joke’s on you, guys. We’re fine,'” she said at the time.
However, Swift’s rep clarified that she had not been made aware of the line about West making “that bitch famous.”
“It never happened,” Swift herself clarified via Instagram. “You cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.”
She added, “You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world.”

Swift’s November 2017 album, “Reputation,” was widely believed to be a revenge record amid her feud with Kardashian and West — and her “Look What You Made Me Do” music video seemed to prove it.
The footage, released that August, featured past versions of Swift, including the then-19-year-old holding her award in confusion as West interrupted her at the VMAs.
In the video, as well as in her promotion of the album, she continuously used serpent imagery to reference the snake emojis left in her comments section by Kardashian fans when the phone call was released.

Kardashian claimed she was “over” the feud during a January 2019 “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” appearance.
“I feel like we’d all moved on,” the Hulu personality claimed.
Elsewhere in the interview, however, Kardashian said she would rather be stuck in an elevator with Drake, another of West’s nemeses, than Swift.

While speaking to Elle in March 2019 about being called “a snake on the internet” and reclaiming that imagery with “Reputation,” she hinted that Kardashian had yet to apologize.
“It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us,” the “Bad Blood” singer told the magazine. “But maybe all I’ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it.”
She noted that “disarming someone’s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh.”

Swift and West’s full phone call leaked online in March 2020, with the Yeezy creator saying, “I’m going to send you the song and send you the exact wording and everything about it, right? And then we could sit and talk through it.”
In her Instagram Story response, Swift doubled down on her claim that the call had been “illegally recorded” and “edited and manipulated in order to frame” her.
Kardashian clapped back later that same day, alleging that “nobody ever denied the word ‘bitch’ was used without her permission.”

Kardashian was asked about her favorite Swift record in a December 2021 episode of the “Honestly with Bari Weiss” podcast.
“I really like a lot of her songs,” she said at the time. “They’re all super cute and catchy.”
The makeup mogul noted that she would “have to look in [her] phone to get a name [of an album],” though.

In January 2023, Kardashian and West’s eldest daughter, North West, danced to Swift’s “Shake It Off” in a TikTok video.
Swift seemingly referenced the social media upload in her April 2024 diss track “thanK you aIMee.”
She crooned, “One day, your kid comes home singin’ / A song that only us two is gonna know is about you.”

“That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before,” she recalled. “I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls.
“I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard,” Swift continued, comparing it to a “career death.”

Fans were quick to notice the capitalization in the “thanK you aIMee” song title in April 2024, believing the song shading a high school bully was actually about Kardashian.
Swift referenced a “bronze, spray-tanned” woman in the track who her mom “wish[es] were dead.”
“All that time you were throwin’ punches, I was buildin’ somethin’,” she sang. “And I can’t forgive the way you made me feel / Screamed ‘F—k you, Aimee’ to the night sky, as the blood was gushin’ / But I can’t forget the way you made me heal.”",2024-04-19T15:34:14Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
"Taylor Swift Seemingly Targets Kim Kardashian And Even Kanye West On New ""Diss Track""","Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, and Kanye West have had their problems in the past. The Swift and Kanye feud dates all the way back to the VMAs, 15 years ago. Furthermore, this feud extended to Kim Kardashian thanks to the infamous ""Famous"" verse and subsequent leaked phone call. Since that time, it has become clear that the whole thing left a sour taste in Taylor's mouth. Although, for the most part, she has stayed quiet on it. Now, however, it seems as though she is making her feelings known with some subliminals on a new track.
Today, Swift dropped off The Tortured Poets Department. On top of these 16 tracks, she delivered 15 new songs in the form of The Anthology. On this deluxe version, there is a track called ""thanK you aIMee."" Fans immediately clocked the fact that the capitalized letter spell Kim. While this might just be a coincidence, there are numerous lyrics that could be interpreted as about Kardashian. ""“All that time you were throwing punches, I was building something / And I can’t forgive the way you made me feel / Screamed ‘F*ck you, Aimee’ to the night sky, as the blood was gushin’ / But I can’t forget the way you made me heal,"" she sings.

Moreover, there are lyrics towards the end of the song in which Swift acknowledges she has changed the name of the person she is talking about in the song. She also alludes to the person's kids singing her songs not knowing they are about them. Uproxx noted that this could very well be a North West reference as North has sung Taylor's songs on social media before. Ultimately, this all seems very petty, especially given how big of an artist Taylor has become. That said, beef seems to be on the menu these days, and pop stars are not exempt from wanting a taste.

Taylor Swift and Kanye West's feud explained in quotes,"“To be clear, the only issue I ever had around the situation was that Taylor lied through her publicist who stated that ‘Kanye never called to ask for permission…’ They clearly spoke so I let you all see that. Nobody ever denied the word ‘b***h’ was used without her permission... The lie was never about the word b***h, it was always whether there was a call or not and the tone of the conversation. I never edited the footage (another lie) – I only posted a few clips on Snapchat to make my point and the full video that recently leaked doesn’t change the narrative.""",2024-04-19T12:20:53Z,https://www.standard.co.uk,Evening Standard
""" The Tortured Poets Department "" : Taylor Swift vise Kim Kardashian dans cette chanson, et sans trop le cacher","Amy Sussman/Getty Images/AFP / Christopher Polk/Penske Media via Getty Images Amy Sussman/Getty Images/AFP / Christopher Polk/Penske Media via Getty Images
MUSIQUE - Les fans le savent bien : Taylor Swift écrit des chansons directement inspirées de sa vie. À chaque nouvel album, les théories se multiplient sur la, ou les, personne(s), qui se cachent derrière les paroles de l’artiste. Et The Tortured Poets Department, sorti ce vendredi 19 avril, ne fait pas exception.
Car si la star américaine ne révèle jamais directement l’objet de son inspiration et insiste même sur le fait qu’une fois sa musique sortie, celle-ci appartient aux fans qui se l’approprient, elle sait très bien que les auditeurs cherchent le moindre indice entre les lignes. Et sur une chanson de son album en particulier, Taylor Swift leur a facilité la tâche.
Tout le monde s’attendait à ce que The Tortured Poets Department évoque sa rupture avec l’acteur britannique Joe Alwyn, avec qui elle a été en couple pendant six ans avant de débuter une idylle avec Travis Kelce. Mais elle chante aussi à propos d’autre relation très médiatisée : celle avec Kim Kardashian.
Le morceau en question se trouve sur la version longue de l’album, The Tortured Poets Department : The Anthology, sortie en surprise deux heures après l’original. Parmi les quinze chansons additionnelles, l’une semble être directement adressée à l’ex-femme de Kanye West, responsable d’une « mort professionnelle » pour Taylor Swift, comme l’intéressée l’expliquait au Time Magazine fin 2023.

Taylor Swift n’oublie pas ce qu’a fait Kanye West
Le titre — thanK you aIMee, écrit de la sorte — cache à peine le sujet principal. Les seules lettres en majuscules épellent KIM, comme l’ont tout de suite remarqué de nombreux fans.
Pour rappel, le conflit entre les deux femmes remonte à 2016, lorsque Kanye West a sorti le titre Famous, dans lequel il cite Taylor Swift, rappant : « Je pense que moi et Taylor, on pourrait coucher ensemble / Pourquoi ? J’ai rendu cette salope célèbre ». La chanteuse s’était indignée et avait affirmé ne pas avoir donné son accord pour que son nom soit utilisé de la sorte, qui plus est dans une référence à une altercation restée célèbre, le rappeur ayant interrompu une remise de prix à Taylor Swift, en 2009, pour clamer que Beyoncé aurait dû gagner à sa place.

Kim Kardashian, qui était mariée au rappeur lors de l’épisode de 2016, avait contre-attaqué en diffusant l’enregistrement d’un appel téléphonique entre Kanye West et Taylor Swift, où il lui citait les paroles « I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex », mais pas l’insulte « I made that b*tch famous ». La star de téléréalité faisait ainsi passer Taylor Swift pour une menteuse.
Après la diffusion de l’enregistrement, pris à son insu, la chanteuse avait reçu une déferlante de haine en ligne avec le hashtag #TaylorSwiftisOverParty (« On fête la fin de Taylor Swift »). Elle s’était alors retirée de la scène médiatique et a, selon elle, presque vu sa carrière détruite. La suite, on la connaît : Taylor Swift est revenue un an plus tard avec l’album Reputation, symbole de sa revanche sur le couple Kardashian-West.
La fille de Kim Kardashian dans la chanson
Si elle est désormais au sommet de sa carrière, elle ne semble pas avoir oublié et pardonné si facilement ce que lui a fait Kim Kardashian. Dans thanK you aIMee, elle chante : « Each time that Aimee stomped across my gravе / And then she wrote hеadlines / In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I’d take » (« Chaque fois qu’Aimee marchait sur ma tombe / Elle faisait la une / Dans le journal local, se moquant de chaque petit pas que je faisais »), en référence à la surmédiatisation de leur querelle, à l’époque en défaveur de Taylor Swift.
Et les références plus ou moins subtiles à l’ex-femme de Kanye West ne s’arrêtent pas là. La chanteuse évoque aussi une brute qui menaçait de la pousser dans les escaliers à l’école, et imagine « une statue de toi, couverte d’autobronzant ».
Le pont avant le dernier refrain est encore plus évident et Taylor Swift a l’air de s’en amuser. Elle écrit : « And so I changed your name, and any real defining clues » (« Et donc j’ai changé ton nom, et tout autre indice identifiable »), alors même que le prénom de Kim est dans le titre de la chanson. Puis elle continue : « And one day, your kid comes home singin’ / A song that only us two is gonna know is about you » (« Et un jour, ton enfant rentre à la maison en chantant une chanson dont seul(e)s nous deux saurons qu’elle est à propos de toi »).

Comme l’ont remarqué de nombreux fans, cette phrase semble être une référence à une vidéo TikTok publiée par North West en janvier 2023. La fille de Kim Kardashian et Kanye West s’était filmée en train de danser avec sa mère sur le tube Shake it off, de Taylor Swift.

Kim quand North va publier un TikTok sur thanK you aIMee
Taylor Swift remercie Kim K
Mais thanK you aIMee n’est pas qu’une chanson vindicative. Taylor Swift y évoque aussi tout le chemin parcouru depuis cette mauvaise passe. « I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool / I built a legacy which you can’t undo (« J’ai écrit un millier de chansons que tu trouves pas cool / J’ai construit un héritage que tu ne peux pas défaire »), chante-t-elle
Elle suggère même que sans Kim Kardashian et leur conflit, elle n’aurait pas pu faire son retour fracassant avec l’album Reputation : « But when I count the scars, there’s a moment of truth / That there wouldn’t be this, if there hadn’t been you » (« Mais quand je compte les cicatrices, la vérité apparaît / Il n’y aurait pas tout ça, s’il n’y avait pas eu toi »).
Elle passe ainsi de crier « Fuck you, Aimee » (« Va te faire foutre, Aimee ») dans les deux premiers refrains, à « Thank you, Aimee » (« Merci, Aimee ») dans le dernier, et répète même ses remerciements à la toute fin de la chanson. Pas sûr que Kim Kardashian se sente flattée pour autant. Mais pour Taylor Swift, c’est ce qu’on appelle l’album de la maturité.

Kanye West’s wife Bianca Censori goes shoeless at Disneyland in new outrageous outfit choice,"Bianca Censori — wife of Kanye West — was spotted out with the rapper in yet another look that has left the public scratching their heads.
The pair strolled the streets of Disneyland in California this week with footage circulating TikTok of Censori’s unusual shoeless statement.
The Melbourne-born architect had only bandages wrapped around her feet while she walked next to West, who was wearing shoes.
She wore a beige bodysuit and a tan piece of cloth that draped on top of it, while West sported an all-white outfit.

The viral video — posted to j.ace.m’s TikTok — attracted more than 3000 comments from concerned fans.
“nah because why is bianca not wearing any shoes,” one puzzled viewer wrote.
A second person commented: “Where the hell are Bianca’s shoes??”
“The most clothes I’ve seen Bianca wear, and she’s not wearing shoes,” another fan said.
Censori is no stranger to an outrageous ensemble, with her outfit choices consistently making headlines globally.
The 29-year-old recently stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles with West sporting a black lacey balconette bra, flesh-coloured lace tights and chunky cork heels. The star seemed to be missing her underwear underneath and covering her privates with her black purse.
This wasn’t the first time she wore see-through bottoms. Censori copped major backlash when she was snapped by paparazzi in France panty-free and could have faced a huge fine of $16,000 for indecent exposure.
It was later revealed that a Hollywood special effects trick was used to achieve the revealing garb, and she was off the hook.",2024-04-19T04:21:39Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow
Kanye West: Los Angeles police investigating whether rapper was involved in alleged battery,"Police in Los Angeles have said they are investigating whether Kanye West was involved in an alleged battery.
Officers were called to Sunset Boulevard around 12.30am on Wednesday after receiving reports of an incident, LAPD confirmed to Sky News' US partner network, NBC News.
West, also known by his rapper name Ye, was gone when police arrived.
The alleged victim, an unidentified man, told officers that the US star punched him in the face multiple times, a police spokesman said.
Milo Yiannopoulos, West's chief of staff at his clothing and apparel company Yeezy, told NBC News in a statement that the incident happened after his wife Bianca Censori was allegedly ""physically assaulted"".
""The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses,"" Mr Yiannopoulos said.
""She was battered and sexually assaulted.""
Police took an incident report from the person who made the claims against West, but have not released any details.

Although commonly interchanged with assault, a battery charge is when there is unlawful contact between the accused and the victim, according to the Old Bailey Solicitors website.
Whereas an assault is when a person intentionally or recklessly causes someone to fear that unlawful force is going to be inflicted upon them.

Mann verletzt: Kanye West wollte Biancas Würde verteidigen,"Kanye West (46) soll am Dienstag einen Mann angegriffen haben, der seine Frau Bianca Censori (29) belästigte. Angeblich schlug der Rapper dem Unbekannten ins Gesicht. Einen möglichen Grund für diese krasse Reaktion will die Beziehungsexpertin Callisto Adams wissen. ""Kanye setzte mit diesem Schlag ein Zeichen und demonstrierte seinen Wunsch, die Ehre und Würde seiner Frau zu schützen. Für den Rapper war es eine Grenzverletzung."" Wie die Therapeutin gegenüber Mirror erklärt, müsse der Wutausbruch nicht unbedingt bedeuten, dass der ""Stronger""-Interpret in Bezug auf seine Partnerin ""besitzergreifend"" ist. Es deute eher ""auf einen Schutzinstinkt oder eine Reaktion auf eine wahrgenommene Bedrohung oder Respektlosigkeit"" hin.
Der Vorfall soll sich am Dienstagabend in Los Angeles ereignet haben. Wie Vertreter des 46-Jährigen gegenüber TMZ bestätigen. ""Der Angreifer stieß nicht nur mit ihr [Bianca] zusammen. Er steckte seine Hände unter ihr Kleid, direkt auf ihren Körper, er packte sie an der Taille, drehte sie herum und warf ihr dann Küsse zu. Sie wurde misshandelt und missbraucht"", heißt es in deren Erklärung. Der Musiker soll den Angreifer daraufhin geschlagen haben und dann mit seiner Frau abgehauen sein. Die Verletzungen des Mannes mussten wohl nicht behandelt werden.
Kanye ist in den vergangenen Jahren einige Male durch seine Ausraster aufgefallen. 2022 war es zu einem besonders heiklen Vorfall gekommen. Wie der Ex von Kim Kardashian (43) bei Hollywood Unlocked erklärte, habe ein Paparazzo vor seinem Studio gewartet und nach Autogrammen gebeten. Ye sei dann aus seinem Auto gestiegen und habe den Mann geschlagen. Der Unbekannte erstattete deshalb Anzeige.

Ihr Ehemann Kanye West soll der Person daraufhin ins Gesicht geschlagen haben.
Die Polizei ermittelt nun wegen Körperverletzung gegen den Rapper. Mehr anzeigen
Kanye «Ye» Wests Ehefrau Bianca Censori soll auf der Strasse «misshandelt und sexuell angegriffen» worden sein. Daraufhin soll der Rapper angeblich einen Mann ins Gesicht geschlagen haben.
Nun ermittelt die Polizei wegen Körperverletzung, wie die amerikanische Website «TMZ» berichtet.
Zuerst hiess es, Censori wurde «begrapscht». Ein Sprecher von Ye schildert den Vorfall gegenüber «Mirror» daraufhin wie folgt: «Ein Fremder hat Bianca ‹begrapscht›» sei als Beschreibung dessen, was passiert ist, völlig unzureichend. Sie sei körperlich angegriffen worden.
«Sie wurde misshandelt und sexuell missbraucht»
«Der Angreifer stiess nicht nur mit ihr zusammen. Er steckte seine Hände unter ihr Kleid, direkt auf ihren Körper, er packte sie an der Taille, drehte sie herum und blies ihr dann Küsse zu.» Er betont: «Sie wurde misshandelt und sexuell missbraucht.»
Die Erklärung folgte einem Bericht, nach dem Strafverfolgungsbeamte «TMZ» verraten hätten, dass es am Dienstagabend zu einem Vorfall kam. Ein nicht identifizierter Mann soll Bianca Censori geschubst oder gepackt haben. Weitere Details sind nicht bekannt, die Polizei untersucht den Vorfall und hat mit den beteiligten Partien gesprochen.
Niemand wurde verletzt und auch die Person, die Ye geschlagen haben soll, hat nach dem Vorfall keinen Arzt aufgesucht. Die Polizei sammelt nun Zeugenaussagen.

Kanye «Ye» West musste sich bereits früher mit Ermittlungen wegen Körperverletzung verantworten. Anfang 2023 wurde eine Klage eingereicht, nachdem ihm ein Fotograf nach einem Vorfall Körperverletzung und Fahrlässigkeit vorgeworfen hatte.

Kanye West and Bianca Censori Spotted After Alleged Assault,"Kanye “Ye” West and wife Bianca Censori were spotted out in Los Angeles separately one day after the 46-year-old rapper was accused of punching a man for allegedly assaulting his 29-year-old wife. Ye and Bianca were photographed on Wednesday, April 17, in different cars.
According to photos published by TMZ, the “Stronger” artist was riding shotgun with a few other men in a car, while Bianca was spotted driving her car solo. The outlet previously reported that the couple were involved in an incident at the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Boulevard in L.A on Tuesday, April 16, hours after they visited Disneyland. Ye was accused of battery by a man whom the rapper claimed assaulted Bianca.

A rep for the Grammy Award winner rereleased a statement to the outlet, claiming that the Yeezy architect was “battered” and “sexually assaulted” by the man whom Ye allegedly punched.
“He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses,” the spokesperson for Ye said. “She was battered and sexually assaulted. ‘Grabbed’ is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted.”
Additionally, the alleged “assailant didn’t merely collide into [Bianca],” the rep added, emphasizing that she was, indeed, touched against her will.
Neither Ye nor Bianca has publicly spoken out about the situation.
The spouses aren’t strangers to attention. Over the past several months, the Australia native and the “Jesus Walks” artist have been seen out and about around L.A. Bianca, most notably, has been spotted wearing revealing and unique outfits, including thin miniskirts, see-through dresses and other interesting looks.
Ye married Bianca in December 2022 shortly after finalizing his divorce from ex-wife Kim Kardashian. He was married to the Kardashians star, 43, for nearly a decade before she filed for divorce from him in 2021. Amid his and Kim’s separation in 2022, Ye was briefly linked to actress Julia Fox.

Kanye West mistenkt for vold – skal ha slått mann i ansiktet
Del
Både TMZ og LA Fox melder torsdag at hiphop-artisten Kanye West er mistenkt for vold.
Han skal ha slått en mann i ansiktet, melder de amerikanske mediene, etter at en mann angivelig skal ha dyttet eller tatt tak i og holdt kona hans Bianca Censori (29).
– «Tatt tak i» er en enorm underdrevet beskrivelse av hva som skjedde. Bianva ble fysisk overfalt, hevder en representant for West oerfor kjendisnettstedet TMZ.
– Vedkommende dultet ikke bare inn i henne. Han puttet hendene under kjolen hennes, spant henne rundt og sendte slengkyss, hevder Wests talsperson videre.
Politiet avhører vitner, og skal også innhente forklaring fra Kanye West.

"Kanye West Is Now A Suspect In A Battery Case, And Bianca Censori Is Involved","Musician Kanye West has a penchant for constantly making headlines, both for his professional career and personal life. Most recently, the chatter has been about Kanye's relationship with Bianca Censori, as well as the wild fashion choices she's worn in public. And now there's a legal shakeup involved, as Kanye is a suspect in a battery case related to Censori. Let's break it all down.
This new information comes to us from TMZ, which reports that police are investigating Kanye after he reportedly punched a man earlier this week. This didn't come out of nowhere, as the person he struck reportedly had tried to grab Censori without her consent. He hasn't been charged with any crimes, but the police are investigating what happened by speaking to witnesses as well as Ye himself.
After this news broke, a rep for Kanye West issued a statement to TMZ. It offers his side of the story, and reads:
The assailant didn't merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted.
There you have it. Clearly this is a high stakes situation, given Kanye's celebrity and past legal shakeups. We'll just have to see how the investigation takes it course, and if any actual charges are filed for the ""Monster"" rapper.
This is just the latest example of Kanye making headlines related to his relationship with Bianca Censori, although it's certainly a new set of circumstances. They've been in the news related to Censori's bold fashion outfits, including her recent trend of wearing tights as pants or going shoeless at Disney.
The pair have also gotten into some legal trouble abroad, being banned from using Italian water taxis after engaging in lewd acts. But the battery investigation might be a more dire situation if Kanye West ends up being at fault for the physical shakeup. Although if his rep's comments are to be believed, he may have had cause for allegedly punching the man who grabbed his wife.
Overall, it seems that Kanye West and Bianca Censori are in it for the long haul, including any hard times that may come for the high profile pair. Censori's ex isn't surprised she ended up with Kanye, so they're seemingly a great match. But we'll have to see if Kanye ends up in hot water over that alleged battery, and what other wild antics the couple might be up to in the future. Smart money says we'll be getting more bold fashion swings from Ye's wife, even if Kanye's kids aren't too fond of how revealing her looks have been as of late.

El rapero Kanye West, de 46 años, fue acusado de agredir físicamente a un hombre tras un presunto acoso sexual y tocamientos inapropiados hacia su esposa, Bianca Censori. Representantes de West salieron en defensa del artista, argumentando que la descripción del incidente como un simple “agarrón” es insuficiente, describiendo el acto como un asalto físico y sexual hacia su actual pareja.
El Departamento de Policía de Los Ángeles (LAPD) recibió un reporte de agresión en contra de West y actualmente está investigando las afirmaciones, que incluyen alegaciones de que el individuo no identificado puso sus manos bajo el vestido de Censori, la agarró de la cintura, la giró y luego le lanzó besos al aire. Los eventos se registraron el pasado martes en Los Angeles.
""Fue maltratada y agredida sexualmente”, clarificó el equipo de Kanye sobre el ataque sufrido por Censori. (Créditos: Backgrid/The Grosby Group)
“El asaltante no simplemente chocó contra ella. Puso sus manos bajo su vestido, directamente sobre su cuerpo, la agarró de la cintura, la hizo girar y luego le sopló besos. Fue maltratada y agredida sexualmente”, afirmó el equipo de Kanye en un intento por clarificar la gravedad del suceso que, según Fox 11, ocurrió en el hotel Chateau Marmont de Sunset Boulevard.
Como respuesta, Kanye lanzó un puñetazo al sujeto, de acuerdo a los informes policiales. Por ahora, la identidad del hombre aún no ha sido difundida por las autoridades. Si bien no resultó con lesiones graves, reportó la agresión ante la policía, mientras que el rapero y su esposa se alejaron del lugar.
Las investigaciones están en curso, y la policía ha anunciado que se pondrá en contacto con West para obtener su versión de los hechos, así como entrevistar a posibles testigos.

Las pasadas polémicas y denuncias contra Kanye West
Este suceso ocurre en el contexto de varios incidentes legales y controvertias públicas en los que West ha estado involucrado. Anteriormente, en 2022, West fue objeto de investigación por parte del LAPD por agresión a una persona que, según alegó, lo provocaba. En enero de ese año, el intérprete de música rap fue demandado por asalto, agresión y negligencia tras supuestamente golpear a un solicitante de autógrafos, Justin Poplawski.
Poplawski afirmó que estaba esperando fuera de un hotel para obtener la firma de West cuando este último le dijo que se fuera de allí antes de que lo golpeara, según documentos judiciales obtenidos por un medio. Sin embargo, en aquel momento, no fue arrestado ni acusado.
Previamente, el rapero estuvo dentro de otras polémicas por denuncias de agresión y hacer comentarios antisemitas. (Créditos: REUTERS/Randall Hill)
Además, el cantante, que cambió su nombre a Ye hace unos años, se casó con Censori, una arquitecta en su empresa Yeezy, en diciembre de 2022, poco después de finalizar su divorcio con la socialité Kim Kardashian, con quien tiene cuatro hijos: North, de 10 años; Chicago de seis años; Saint, de ocho año; y Psalm, de cuatro años.
En el último año, experimentó tanto desafíos profesionales como un renacimiento en su carrera. Tras perder varios contratos de asociación de marca por comentarios antisemitas, se disculpó públicamente y lanzó un nuevo álbum, Vultures, en colaboración con Ty Dolla $ign. Este disco obtuvo un gran éxito, encabezando las listas de éxitos en EE. UU. y produciendo el hit global “Carnival”.

Bianca Censori genera controversia en Disneyland
El incidente con Censori generó amplia discusión, no solo por el asalto denunciado sino también por su aparición en Disneyland California, donde fue vista caminando descalza junto a West. Esto último provocó cuestionamientos sobre las políticas de vestimenta del parque, ya que las normas oficiales de Disney prohíben la entrada a aquellos que no lleven la vestimenta adecuada, incluyendo zapatos y camisas.
Usuarios en línea se preguntaron cómo fue posible su ingreso bajo estas condiciones, lo que ha desencadenado un debate más amplio sobre la consistencia en la aplicación de las reglas del parque: “Se debe llevar ropa adecuada en todo momento, incluidos zapatos y camisas”, estableció las políticas de cortesía y vestimenta de los huéspedes del parque de atracciones.",2024-04-18T13:48:27Z,https://www.infobae.com,infobae
Kanye West Suspect of Battery After Man Sexually Assaults Bianca Censori,"Kanye “Ye” West is reportedly under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department for allegedly punching a man, whom the rapper, 46, accused of sexually assaulting his wife, Bianca Censori. The incident took place on Tuesday, April 16, at the Chateau Marmont Hotel on Sunset Boulevard in L.A., according to multiple outlets.
TMZ was the first to report the news on Wednesday, April 17. Per the outlet, Censori, 29, and West “took off” right after West allegedly punched the man in question. The unidentified person did not require medical attention. A rep for the “Jesus Walks” rapper also provided a statement to the outlet, claiming that Censori was not simply “grabbed” by the individual but was “sexually assaulted” by him.
“He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses,” the spokesperson said. “She was battered and sexually assaulted. ‘Grabbed’ is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted.”
According to the representative, Censori’s alleged “assailant didn’t merely collide into her.”
Earlier that day, West and Censori were spotted in Disneyland together. During the afternoon outing, the Aussie wore no shoes – only bandages on her feet — and a nude-colored bodysuit with a plain frock draped over it. For his part, West wore an all-white outfit with black sunglasses. They also held hands while walking through the park with a private VIP tour guide in Galaxy’s Edge, according to multiple social media videos.

West and Censori have made headlines ever since getting married in December 2022. The Yeezy employee has worn unique outfits alongside her husband during most of their outings together. From thin miniskirts to completely see-through dresses, Censori’s fashion has made quite a statement.
Toward the end of 2023, though, rumors swirled over West and Censori’s possible breakup due to concerns from her family. However, neither West nor Censori have publicly spoken out about their relationship.

Ye probed for punching man he says groped Bianca Censori,"Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, is being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department for the alleged battery of a man the rapper claims sexually assaulted his wife, Bianca Censori, according to reports.
The 46-year-old Grammy winner allegedly punched the unnamed man in the face late Tuesday night, sources told TMZ. While the man did not require medical attention, he did file a battery report with the LAPD. He said both West and the Yeezy architect left the scene quickly after the confrontation.
TMZ initially reported West turned violent after the man “grabbed or pushed” Censori, but a rep for the rapper later commented, alleging his actions were much more serious than that.
“‘Grabbed’ is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened,” the rep said.
“Bianca was physically assaulted,” they continued. “The assailant didn’t merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted.”
The couple earlier in the day were spotted at Disneyland, where Censori was uncharacteristically covered up for their stroll through the theme park.
Ye and Censori reportedly married in December 2022, less than a month after his divorce from Kim Kardashian was finalized. Since then, Ye has taken to dressing his wife in increasingly scandalous outfits, among them sheer ensembles, some of them without tops, others without bottoms.
As of late Wednesday, no charges had been filed in connection with the battery case. Authorities said they plan to contact Ye and interview additional witnesses as the investigation unfolds.
The incident is far from the first time Ye has been at the center of a battery investigation. In 2023, police looked into an incident during which he snatched a woman’s phone and then chucked it into the street. Video of the incident shows the “Heartless” rapper approach the photographer’s vehicle, seemingly annoyed that he is being filmed, and then confronting her following his daughter, North West’s basketball game.
“Stop with your cameras,” he said.
The “Donda” singer was also sued for assault and battery earlier this year by a man West claimed was taunting him ahead of the physical confrontation, which occurred back in 2022.
“He just had this real attitude, like, ‘Whatchu gonna do?’” said Ye, who was not arrested or charged over the incident. “Imma just tell you, that blue Covid mask ain’t stop that knockout.”",2024-04-18T12:57:05Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News

Según los representantes del artista, “empujar o agarrar” es “una expresión tremendamente inadecuada como descripción de lo sucedido: Bianca fue agredida físicamente”, según declaraciones realizadas a TMZ. Y prosiguen: “El agresor no se limitó a chocar contra ella. Puso sus manos debajo de su vestido, directamente sobre su cuerpo, la agarró por la cintura, la hizo girar y luego le lanzó besos. Fue golpeada y agredida sexualmente”. El denunciante no requirió tratamiento médico por sus heridas, pero presentó el informe de agresión a la policía.
Kanye West y Bianca Censori contrajeron matrimonio, en secreto, apenas 20 días después de que el rapero firmara en noviembre de 2022 el divorcio con Kim Kardashian. West, que mantuvo un fugaz romance con la actriz Julia Fox y que encadenó una relación tras otra desde su separación de Kim Kardashian en enero de 2021, ya se dejó ver junto a Bianca Censori en un desfile de Balenciaga en mayo de 2022. La pareja contrajo matrimonio el 20 de diciembre de 2022, mientras que la disolución del matrimonio de Ye —que ahora es su nombre legal— había tenido lugar menos de tres semanas antes, el 30 de noviembre, tras casi un año de negociaciones con la estrella de la telerrealidad y empresaria. Censori es diseñadora y trabajaba para la marca deportiva Yeezy, propiedad del músico.
El puñetazo es tan solo el último de los numerosos escándalos que West lleva protagonizando desde hace años. De ser considerado uno de los mejores músicos de su generación, y de los más influyentes, en la actualidad se ha convertido en un paria en las dos industrias en las que un día dominó: la musical y la de la moda. En enero de 2021 se anunciaba su separación de la hermana más célebre del clan Kardashian tras siete años de matrimonio y cuatro hijos en común. En octubre de 2022 el cantante, diagnosticado desde hace tiempo con un trastorno de bipolaridad, entraba en una espiral de insensatez y antisemitismo que le costó, entre muchas cosas, su lucrativo acuerdo con Adidas. Uno de los actos más llamativos que precipitó su caída fue realizar un desfile de moda sorpresa en París de su firma Yeezy en el que presentaba, además de lucirla él mismo, una camiseta en la que se leía White Lives Matter (las vidas blancas importan). El lema es el empleado por los supremacistas blancos en Estados Unidos en respuesta al movimiento antirracista Black Lives Matter (las vidas negras importan). Tras ese incidente, el rapero, firme defensor de Donald Trump, aseguró en una entrevista en el podcast Drink Champs que George Floyd murió por consumir drogas y no por asfixia cuando fue detenido por un policía en 2020. Inmediatamente después de todo esto, la firma deportiva alemana emitía un comunicado anunciando el cese de su relación creativa y comercial con Yeezy, la marca del rapero, y este dejaba de ser milmillonario.
En los últimos tiempos, la razón por la que Ye aparece en los medios jamás tiene que ver con su trabajo. Sus apariciones junto a su esposa suelen acaparar titulares, debido al cambio estilístico que Censori ha protagonizado desde que se casó con el rapero. No es la primera: West es conocido por su obsesivo control sobre el aspecto y el armario de sus parejas. La modelo Amber Rose, con la que el artista mantuvo una relación con un pico mediático de atención entre 2009 y 2010, habló sobre ello en la revista Elle en 2009, a propósito de cómo intentaba cambiar su estilo: “A mí me va el rosa eléctrico y el amarillo chillón, pero a él no. Su color favorito es el color hueso. ¿Qué clase de persona tiene como color favorito el color hueso?”. En un episodio de Keeping Up With The Kardashians el mundo fue testigo de cómo West, que se vanagloria de haber dado con el estilo idóneo para su exmujer, irrumpe en la casa de Calabasas y tira todo su armario. También sucedió durante su breve romance con la actriz Julia Fox y, ahora, con Censori. Cada aparición pública de la pareja parece un acto performativo. Sea por lo que sea, West hace tiempo que dejó de ser noticia por su talento musical.",2024-04-18T10:11:26Z,https://elpais.com,El País
Kanye West suspected of attacking man who allegedly sexually assaulted his wife,"Representatives for Kanye West have alleged that a man physically and sexually assaulted his wife Bianca Censori in an incident in Los Angeles.
Sources previously told TMZ that West was being investigated as a suspect in a battery incident earlier this week, after the rapper was alleged to have struck a man who had grabbed Censori.
The rapper’s team have subsequently released a statement, saying: “‘Grabbed’ is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted. The assailant didn’t merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted.”
The Guardian has contacted the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for further information.
It follows an incident in 2022 when West was investigated by the LAPD for battery of a person he claimed was taunting him. “He just had this real attitude, like, ‘Whatchu gonna do?’”, said West, who was not arrested or charged over the incident. “Imma just tell you, that blue Covid mask ain’t stop that knockout.”
West, who has changed his name to Ye, reportedly married Censori, an architect at his company Yeezy, in December 2022, less than a month after his divorce from Kim Kardashian was finalised.
That year West lost a series of brand partnership deals with Adidas and others in the wake of a series of antisemitic comments, including that Jewish people “tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda”. But he has enjoyed a career renaissance this year following the release of his album Vultures, a collaboration with vocalist Ty Dolla $ign which topped the US chart and produced the global hit Carnival, which also went to No 1 in the US.
In December 2023, West apologised for the antisemitic remarks, writing in Hebrew on social media: “I deeply regret any pain I may have caused … I am committed to making amends and promoting unity.”",2024-04-18T09:26:26Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
"Investigan a Kanye West por golpear a un hombre, pero el rapero asegura que fue para defender a su esposa de una agresión sexual","Según han podido saber desde el portal de noticias TMZ, la Policía de Los Ángeles ha elaborado recientemente un informe sobre una agresión física contra un hombre y quien aparece como el principal sospechoso de haberla cometido no es otro que Kanye West, lo que se sumaría a sus otros problemas legales hoy en día.
Sin embargo, los agentes se encuentran investigando lo sucedido, porque la versión del rapero y empresario de 46 años dista mucho de la que recogieron las autoridades el pasado martes por la noche, cuando un hombre aseguró que Ye le había pegado un puñetazo en la cara. Y todo señala que también es importante en la resolución de los hechos la figura de su esposa, Bianca Censori.
Según ha podido saber la Policía, el hombre al que acabó golpeando el autor de canciones como Stronger o Runaway habría previamente empujado o agarrado a Censori, lo que condujo a la posterior reacción violenta del músico.
Asimismo, según el citado medio, Kanye West y su esposa se habrían marchado inmediatamente después del supuesto altercado, así como señalan desde el portal que la presunta víctima no requirió ningún tratamiento médico para sus lesiones. Los agentes están buscando ahora ponerse en contacto con Kanye, Bianca y con los testigos para que den su versión de lo sucedido.
Aunque es muy probable que el rapero y la diseñadora ya hayan prestado declaración, dado que uno de sus representantes ha hablado con TMZ, pidiéndoles que corrijan su titular, que hablaba de que el hombre agredido había ""agarrado o empujado"" a Censori. ""La palabra 'agarrado' es tremendamente inadecuada para describir lo que pasó"", ha puntualizado.
Según el representante del rapero, ""Bianca fue agredida físicamente"" por lo que no se puede decir ""algo tan sencillo como que el agresor chocó contra ella"". ""Él le metió las manos debajo de su vestido, sobre la piel directamente, la agarró por la cintura, la hizo girar y luego le intentó dar varios besos. Eso se llama maltrato y Bianca fue agredida sexualmente"", ha declarado el agente de Kanye.
Ahora solo queda esperar a la investigación policial para saber cómo se resuelve este nuevo caso del rapero para con la Justicia, habida cuenta de la cantidad de demandas interpuestas contra él que tiene, siendo la última la de un exempleado de su Donda Academy.",2024-04-18T09:10:05Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos

On ne le présente plus. Artiste multi récompensé, producteur, designer… Kanye West est sur tous les fronts et aime exprimer sa créativité à travers ses nombreuses œuvres. Connu dans le monde entier et respecté, l’homme de 46 ans se fait tout de même plus discret ces derniers temps dans les médias. En réalité, c’est surtout pour sa relation avec Bianca Censori, une ancienne architecte australienne de 29 ans, que le rappeur fait parler de lui.
Kanye West et Bianca Censori, un couple uni
Si Kanye West a été épanoui de nombreuses années aux côtés de Kim Kardashian, la mère de ses quatre enfants, c’est désormais avec Bianca Censori qu’il coule des jours heureux. Leur coup de cœur était tel que ces derniers se sont mariés quelques semaines seulement après le divorce du rappeur. Ensemble, Kanye et Bianca ont fait le choix d’être le plus discrets possible. « Ye est une mégastar depuis deux décennies et son premier mariage était avec quelqu’un qui vit presque à plein temps devant une caméra (Kim Kardashian, ndlr). Bianca et Ye sont dans une optique totalement différente. Ils sont très privés », avait justement rappelé l’un des amis proches de Kanye West au Daily Mail.
Bianca Censori agressée physiquement
Aujourd’hui pourtant, celui à qui l’on doit de nombreux tubes comme Stronger, Flashing Lights ou encore American Boy fait les gros titres pour une sombre histoire de bagarre. En effet, selon les révélations du média américain TMZ, Kanye West fait l’objet d’une enquête pour coups et blessures. Ce dernier aurait ainsi frappé un homme au visage ce mardi 16 avril après qu’il ait physiquement agressé Bianca Censori.
« L’agresseur ne s’est pas contenté de la percuter. Il a mis ses mains sous sa robe, directement sur son corps, il lui a attrapé la taille, il l’a fait tourner, puis il lui a envoyé des baisers. Elle a été malmenée et agressée sexuellement », a ainsi détaillé un représentant du rappeur. Toujours selon le média, Kanye West et Bianca Censori auraient pris la fuite après l’altercation. Du côté de la victime présumée, rien de grave. Celle-ci n’aurait pas eu besoin de soins pour ses blessures. Rien n’a cependant été mentionné concernant l’état de celle qui a copié le look de Kim Kardashian dix ans après.
Kanye West déjà accusé de violence dans le passé
Ce n’est pas la première fois que Kanye West prouve qu’il sait se défendre. Souvenez-vous, le rappeur avait déjà fait les gros titres l’année dernière lorsqu’une vidéo le montrait en train de prendre le téléphone d’un photographe puis le jeter violemment en pleine rue. En 2022, Kanye West se serait également montré violent envers un homme dans le centre-ville de Los Angeles. Ce dernier l’aurait en effet frappé en lui lançant « Je vais faire de toi un putain d’exemple ». Décidément, mieux vaut ne pas trop jouer avec les nerfs du rappeur.",2024-04-18T09:00:45Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty

Kanye West Named as Battery Suspect by LAPD After ‘Punching Man Who Grabbed Bianca Censori’ at Disneyland,"Famous rapper Kanye West finds himself embroiled in controversy once again, this time as a battery suspect following an altercation at Disneyland. The incident revolves around allegations that West punched a man who had reportedly sexually assaulted and inappropriately touched his wife, Bianca Censori, during their visit to Disneyland. According to reports from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), the situation unraveled when an unnamed male individual allegedly pushed or grabbed Censori, nudging a swift and retaliatory response from West. The LAPD’s battery report obtained by TMZ highlights that West punched the man in response to the reported assault.

However, the details of the incident have ignited a heated debate, with West’s representatives ferociously contesting the characterization of the event. They said, “‘Grabbed’ is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened. Bianca was physically assaulted. The assailant didn't merely collide with her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, spun her around, and then blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted,” as reported by the New York Post. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday night, nudged the filing of a battery report by the unnamed man. While he did not require medical treatment for injuries, the incident has accumulated prominent attention due to the high-profile nature of those involved.
It's troubling to hear about the incident involving Kanye West. While emotions can heavily influence our reactions, especially in protective scenarios, it's crucial for public figures to model restraint and legal compliance. This event might also bring attention to how… — The Unknown Explorer (@ShortdeckS) April 18, 2024
Adding to the scrutiny surrounding the incident is the context in which it occurred. Earlier that day, Censori had made headlines for her appearance at Disneyland alongside West. Despite efforts to cover up more than usual, including wrapping her bare feet and ankles with bandages, Censori's attire raised questions about adherence to Disneyland's dress code policies, particularly regarding footwear. As per the reports of Daily Mail, one furious user wrote, “Why didn’t Disney refuse entry? She is not suitably attired for a family environment.”

Another user added, “I got told off by a member of staff in Disneyworld Florida for walking barefoot in a rainstorm (trying to save my leather sandals). One rule for some…” A third echoed the same emotions and remarked, “Why is [Bianca] allowed in there with no shoes? I think others should take their shoes off today and see how many get escorted out,” Another questioned, “I’ve seen articles of girls getting escorted out because their shorts were too short or they were wearing a tank top. Why aren’t people confronting these two and making their own stand?”

The reported assault incident prompted users to speculate and scrutinize the couple online, as one wrote, “I am confident that the individual responsible for attacking his spouse will receive an award.California.” A second shared, “It’s like Kanye dropped off the map and then shows up every now and then in some bizarre instance..” Another shared their concern and exclaimed, “It's troubling to hear about the incident involving Kanye West. While emotions can heavily influence our reactions, especially in protective scenarios, public figures must model restraint and legal compliance. This event might also bring attention to how celebrities handle confrontations and the legal repercussions that follow, providing a learning opportunity for all on handling disputes calmly and legally.”",2024-04-18T07:55:48Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

Kanye West Has A History Of Battery Charges
Kanye West is no stranger to assault and battery charges. The rapper allegedly beat up a fan who asked for an autograph in January. He said he was going to make a ""f**king example"" out of the fan, and struck him several times on the street. Completely different battery charges arose the same month, after West got into an altercation with an LA photographer. The rapper accused the photographer of following her and Censori, before snatching the cell phone from her hand and throwing it into the street.
Regardless, West has repeatedly deflected criticisms of his public behavior. In February, the rapper hopped on Instagram Live to talk about his relationship with Censori. ""Ima post my wife as much as I want bro,"" he told viewers. ""It makes me happy. Some people don’t want you to be happy, they want you to make them happy I decided to make myself happy and I’m happy with that.""

Frau beschützt? Kanye West wird Körperverletzung vorgeworfen,"Erneute Schlagzeilen um Kanye West (46): Dem Rapper könnten rechtliche Probleme drohen, nachdem er angeblich einen Mann angegriffen und geschlagen hat. Wie TMZ jetzt berichtet, ereignete sich der vermeintliche Vorfall am Dienstagabend, als der Mann versucht haben soll, Kanyes Frau Bianca Censori (29) zu schubsen und anzufassen. Nach der angeblichen Auseinandersetzung soll das Ehepaar geflohen sein, während das mutmaßliche Opfer medizinische Versorgung gebraucht hatte. Die Polizei soll jetzt geplant haben, den 46-Jährigen zu befragen und zudem nach weiteren Zeugen zu suchen.
Vertreter des Rappers äußerten sich bereits gegenüber dem Medium zu dem Vorfall – und machten dabei deutlich, dass es sich nicht nur um einen Stoß handelte: ""Der Angreifer stieß nicht nur mit ihr zusammen. Er steckte seine Hände unter ihr Kleid, direkt auf ihren Körper, er packte sie an der Taille, drehte sie herum und warf ihr dann Küsse zu. Sie wurde misshandelt und missbraucht."" Zu dem körperlichen Angriff gegen den Mann bezogen aber weder die Vertreter noch Kanye und Bianca selbst Stellung.
Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass der Ex von Kim Kardashian (43) mit körperlichen Auseinandersetzungen auf sich aufmerksam macht: Im vergangenen Jahr hatte eine Fotografin eine Klage gegen Kanye eingereicht. Wie Spiegel damals berichtete, behauptete die Fotografin Nichol Lechmanik auf einer Pressekonferenz, dass der Rapper einen dauerhaften psychischen Schaden bei ihr verursacht habe. ""Er griff in mein Auto, als wollte er mich schlagen, riss mir mein Handy aus der Hand und warf es dann wütend auf die Straße"", erklärte sie und stellte außerdem klar: ""Er hat kein Recht, mich anzugreifen, zu verprügeln oder mir Angst zu machen, meinen Beruf auszuüben.""
Wenige Tage später lag TMZ ein Video des ""Can't Tell Me Nothing""-Interpreten vor, in dem er einen Paparazzo anschreit: ""Dein Ernst? Kannst du bitte aufhören, mir zu folgen?"" Zuvor hatte der Mann Kanye, seinen Sohn Saint (8) und Bianca verfolgt, als diese auf dem Weg in eine Kirche waren. Aber auch gegenüber einem ehemaligen Geschäftspartner wurde Kanye bereits ausfällig: In dem Dokumentarfilm ""In Troube with KanYe"" beschuldigte Alex Klein Kanye, sich antisemitisch geäußert zu haben, nachdem er die Zusammenarbeit mit dem Rapper beendet hatte. ""Kanye war sehr wütend, er sagte: 'Ich möchte dich schlagen' und 'Du bist genau wie die anderen Juden'. Er genoss es fast, wie beleidigend er sein konnte, und benutzte diese Ausdrücke in der Hoffnung, mich zu verletzen"", erinnerte sich der einstige Geschäftspartner zurück.
Trotz alledem scheint Bianca zu ihrem Ehemann zu halten. Kanyes Ex und Mutter seiner vier Kinder machte in der Vergangenheit aber immer wieder deutlich, wie sehr ihr sein Verhalten zusetzt. ""Ich empfinde so viel Mitleid für ihn. Ich weiß nicht einmal, ob er sich selbst deswegen schlecht fühlt. Ich weiß gar nicht, ob er weiß, wie das geht. Aber ich fühle mich so schlecht"", erklärte Kim im vergangenen Jahr in ihrer Show The Kardashians. Die Unternehmerin erkenne ihren Ex-Mann nicht wieder.

Ohne Kids: Kanye West und Bianca haben Date im Disneyland,"Das Disneyland gilt als der Traum jedes Kindes. Doch obwohl der US-amerikanische Rapper Kanye West (46) stolzer vierfacher Vater ist, verbringt er nun Zeit ohne seine Kids in dem beliebten Freizeitpark in Kalifornien. Der Musiker wählt stattdessen seine Partnerin Bianca Censori (29) als Begleitung. Zusammen genießt das Paar seine Zweisamkeit sichtlich. In den zahlreichen Clips, die TMZ vorliegen, wirken die australische Designerin und der Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian (43) schwer verliebt. Lässig schlendert das Hollywood-Duo Hand in Hand durch den Vergnügungspark. Wie das Magazin jetzt berichtet, trauen sie sich sogar auf einige Fahrgeschäfte. Auf den Schnappschüssen sieht man Bianca freudestrahlend auf dem Karussell, während Kanye sich bei einem Star Wars-Event vergnügt.
Auch die Looks der Turteltauben sorgen bei den Fans für einen echten Hingucker. Bianca trägt wie gewohnt ein sehr figurbetontes Outfit. Im eng anliegenden beigen Body spaziert die Architektin durch den Freizeitpark. Was den aufmerksamen Zuschauern besonders auffällt: Die 29-Jährige trägt keine Schuhe! Kanye wählt für das Disneyland-Date hingegen ein lässiges Outfit, ganz in Weiß. Der ""Can't Tell Me Nothing""-Interpret kombiniert eine lockere Jogginghose mit einem coolen Hoodie.
Auf den süßen Schnappschüssen wirkt das Paar wie frisch verliebt. Obwohl böse Zungen immer wieder behaupten, dass der Rapper und die Italienerin eine toxische Beziehung führen würden, beteuerte eine entfernte Verwandte von Bianca vor wenigen Tagen das Liebesglück des Designer-Pärchens. In der australischen Radioshow ""Ben, Liam & Belle"" machte die Informantin deutlich: ""Alles, was ich weiß, ist, dass sie verliebt und glücklich sind!""

Kanye West faces police investigation for alleged battery over Bianca Censori,"Kanye West and Bianca Censori were spotted at Disneyland California earlier that same day on Tuesday
Kanye West is under police investigation for reportedly punching a man who physically and sexually assaulted his wife Bianca Censori.
The legendary rapper, 46, was named as a suspect for battery in an LAPD police report obtained by TMZ on Wednesday, which also acknowledged that the unidentified male first “pushed or grabbed” Ye’s wife, prompting Ye’s response.
However, Ye’s rep corrected the report in a statement to TMZ by emphasising that the word “grabbed” in the initial report “is grossly inadequate as a description of what happened.”
The rep further clarified, “Bianca was physically assaulted.”
“The assailant didn’t merely collide into her. He put his hands under her dress, directly on her body, he grabbed her waist, he spun her around, and then he blew her kisses. She was battered and sexually assaulted,” Ye’s rep detailed.
The incident reportedly occurred on Tuesday night – the same day that the high-profile couple were spotted enjoying a day at Disneyland, California.
Once Ye clocked his wife’s alleged assailant, the pair reportedly “fled the scene.” Meanwhile, the unnamed man proceeded to file a battery report against Ye, though he did not require treatment for any injuries.",2024-04-17T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Taylor Swift’s pal Jack Antonoff takes dig at her nemesis Kanye West,"Taylor Swift has been infamously feuding with Kanye West and his ex-wife Kim Kardashian for years
Taylor Swift may be above talking about her long-standing rivalry with rap legend Kanye West, but her longtime friend and music collaborator Jack Antonoff surely isn’t.
During his appearance on Tuesday’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Antonoff, 40, didn’t hold back when responding to host Kimmel’s question, “What do you have against men.”
Kimmel, of course, was making a lighthearted joke about the fact that the Grammy-winning music producer has notably collaborated with a huge lineup of female artists, including Lana Del Rey, Lorde, and Florence & the Machine, to name a few.
Antonoff merely noted, “I find men to be very over sensitive.”
He continued, “There’s two people I think are too overly sensitive to even function and it’s men and members of the music industry. The amount of sensitivity. It’s sort of like watching Kanye, like, oh my god.”
Antonoff then indirectly called Ye a huge cry baby, quipping, “If I saw Kanye, I’d go up to him and be like, ‘Your diaper’s so full! We have to change your diaper. Your diaper needs to be changed.”",2024-04-17T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Kanye West wife Bianca Censori covers up at Disneyland,"Ye’s wife Bianca Censori stunned onlookers Tuesday when the couple showed up at Disneyland and she was uncharacteristically covered up.
The Yeezy architectural designer, 29, whose body is regularly put on display in revealing outfits and on her husband’s Instagram, was fully clothed during Tuesday’s kids-free jaunt to the Happiest Place on Earth, according to images published by TMZ.
Censori was sporting a beige bodysuit that, unlike many of her other widely publicized get-ups, afforded her private parts a good deal of coverage. Funnily though, her feet were the most exposed, as she was barefoot save for bandages wrapped around them.
The two looked to be in great spirits as they strolled around hand in hand, the outlet reports.
Censori and the Grammy winner formerly known as Kanye West wed early last year, just months after he finalized his divorce from Kim Kardashian. Ye and Kardashian share four young children.
Censori and West’s relationship has often been criticized for the explicit images he shares of her. While some have defended the bizarre behavior as something the couple likely enjoys together, many fans have expressed concern for Censori’s well-being.
“Gurl, blink if you need help,” one commenter urged earlier this year.
“This creeps me out,” said another, regarding a nearly-nude snap of Censori.
“Who is going to save this woman from Kanye and then save Kanye from himself,” said another critic.",2024-04-17T16:59:19Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News

Perhaps she was cosplaying as Pocahontas?
Bianca Censori stepped out barefoot for a Disneyland date with Kanye West Tuesday afternoon.
The shoeless beauty had only bandages covering her feet as she strolled around the California theme park with the rapper, who had on an all-white ensemble — that included shoes.
Censori completed her outfit with a beige bodysuit and tan piece of cloth that laid on top of it.

The Yeezy architect did not seem uncomfortable — despite having no shoes on — as she was seen laughing and in good spirits while riding a carousel and walking with West at the happiest place on Earth.
However, medical experts advise against going barefoot in public places because it can expose a person’s feet to cuts, bruises, warts, fungal infections and other diseases such as tetanus.
Censori has often dressed unconventionally, though, ever since she married West in December 2022.

The Australian model is frequently seen out in public wearing little to no clothing, including sheer dresses, a lace bra and tights and bikini tops and miniskirts.
West, 46, is believed to be the mastermind behind these risqué looks, incentivizing many critics to call him “controlling” for encouraging Censori, 29, to dress in such a manner.
“She’s trapped in a dangerous psychological game,” one person previously wrote via social media.
Censori’s father, Leo Censori, reportedly has also expressed concern over the way his daughter has been dressing lately.

“Bianca’s father, Leo, wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” a source told the Daily Mail in March.
“He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.”
However, multiple insiders close to West have insisted to Page Six that the “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” rapper is not manipulating his wife and that her clothing is just “performance art.”

“People are confusing Bianca’s creativity,” a source said in March.
“She is a phenomenal personality, a phenomenal actor, who can entertain the public. She’s a performance artist. Bianca is as much a performer as Ye is.”

West’s musical partner Malik Yusef added at the time, “She makes her own decisions on how to dress. I think [she and West] experiment together and say, ‘Hey, this is beautiful.’”
When a paparazzo recently asked the “Heartless” rapper directly whether he controls Bianca, he angrily took the camera and said, “Don’t come at me with that dumbass s–t. I’m a person. Are you crazy?”

However, West’s ex Amber Rose recently spoke out, claiming she felt the Yeezy founder had pressured her to dress more seductively — despite her “conservative” hesitations — during their own romance.
“That was my first relationship with a celebrity ever but also in the public eye,” the model, 40, explained last month. “And he knows a lot about fashion, and he always wanted me to dress very sexy.”
Rose, who dated West from 2008 to 2010, concluded, “I remember fighting so hard to not be that person and no one would let me.”",2024-04-17T16:06:08Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
Jack Antonoff Mocks Kanye West on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live': Watch,"Jack Antonoff is bringing his distaste for Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) to national television. Speaking to Jimmy Kimmel Tuesday night (April 16), the producer took shots at the rapper while indulging in a mock-therapy session with the late-night host, likening the “Donda” musician to a fussy baby with an overly full diaper.
“There’s two people that I think are too oversensitive to even function, and it’s men and members of the music industry,” the Bleachers frontman explained on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, lying back in his chair while role-playing a patient in therapy. “The amount of sensitivity — it’s sort of like watching Kanye. If I saw Kanye, I’d run up to him and be like, ‘Your diaper is so full, we have to change your diaper. Your diaper needs to be changed, it’s a huge problem.'”
“The truth is, I’m not that offended,” Antonoff added, touching on Ye’s history of antisemitism, which last year cost the rapper multiple brand partnerships and led to the loss of his billionaire status. “I’m offended, but I’m not that offended, so I don’t like to play this character of overly offended. I prefer to sort of up the trolling.”
Trending on Billboard
It’s not the first time Antonoff, who is Jewish, has poked fun at Ye. In fact, it’s not even the first time he’s implied that the controversial figure is suffering from a loaded pull-up. In a February interview with the Los Angeles Times, the “Don’t Take the Money” singer quipped that the rapper “just needs his diaper changed so badly.”
“It’s been a long time since I would’ve taken Kanye’s call,” he added at the time when asked whether he’d ever work with Ye in the future. “I’m so incredibly bored when someone doesn’t have the sauce anymore, so they go elsewhere to shock. It’s just a remarkable waste of space.”
Aside from Ye’s hate speech, Antonoff has another big reason to oppose the hip-hop titan. The former Fun band member is a longtime friend and collaborator to Taylor Swift, whose tumultuous feud with Ye has been highly publicized over the years.
In January, Antonoff also called the “Gold Digger” artist a “little cry baby b—h“ in a tweet upon finding out that Ye’s album Vultures 2 was slated to arrive on March 8, the same day Bleachers dropped its self-titled record. Bleachers debuted at No. 62 on the Billboard 200, while the Yeezy founder’s project was delayed.
Antonoff is fresh off his performance with Bleachers at the opening weekend of Coachella 2024, which was attended by Swift and Travis Kelce. The guitarist will take the Mojave Stage once again Saturday (April 20), when the festival resumes for a second weekend.

"Jack Antonoff Rips Kanye West On ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" With Continued Diaper Jokes","Jack Antonoff brought up the topic of Kanye West while appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday night. In doing so, he explained why he doesn't like working with men in the music industry and accused the Vultures rapper of wearing diapers. The conversation arose after Kimmel listed off Antonoff's most famous collaborators, all of whom were women.
“I think men… There’s two people that I think are are almost too over-sensitive to even function, and it’s men and members of the music industry,"" he explained. ""The amount of sensitivity… it’s sort of like watching Kanye. By the way — and Jimmy, you might like this because I know that you have your own relationship with the right and how you interact with them, and you’re much closer to how I see these things than other people. I don’t like going to people and, ‘You do this, you do this, blah blah blah,’ because that’s what they want, you know, this sort of type of over-sensitive man. So I just do more of this, like… like if I saw Kanye, I would run up to him and be like, ‘The diaper… your diaper is so full, we have to change your diaper. Your diaper needs to be changed, there’s a huge problem.'”

Kanye West’s Wife Bianca Censori Wears Nude Bodysuit to Disneyland,"The Happiest Place on Earth just had a wild fashion moment. Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori enjoyed a date at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, on Tuesday, April 16.
While enjoying some Disney magic without kids, the couple got pop culture fans talking thanks to their theme park style.
In photos obtained by TMZ, Kanye, 46, dressed in all white from head to toe. As for Bianca, 29, she opted for a nude-colored bodysuit. To complete her look, the model chose not to wear comfortable shoes for a day of walking. Instead, she appeared to nearly go barefoot minus a few bandages wrapped around her feet.
During their visit, the couple was spotted enjoying the merry-go-round and experiencing Disneyland After Dark: Star Wars Nite. According to the resort, the after-hours party is packed with galactic fun and runs from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. on select nights.
Kanye — who shares North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4, with ex-wife Kim Kardashian — hasn’t revealed too much about his latest relationship.
But before deactivating his Instagram, the Grammy winner gushed about his wife on her birthday.
“Happy birthday to the most beautiful super bad iconic muse inspirational talented artist masters degree in architecture 140 IQ loving by my side everyday when half the world turned their backs on me…” he wrote via Instagram in January 2024. “I love you so much thank you for sharing your life with me.”
As for Bianca, she rarely conducts interviews with the press. Instead, the architectural designer for Yeezy continues to make fashion statements when she steps out in public.
Whether wearing a low plunging v-neck dress to a birthday party or a barely-there leotard at Milan Fashion Week, Bianca gets fans talking with her creative looks.
While it’s unclear if Kanye has any input in the ensembles, he has offered his fashion opinion to previous partners.
According to Kim, 43, the rapper played a role in what she would wear to certain special events.
“At my first Met experience, Kanye was there to teach me so much about fashion, and I’m so grateful to him,” she said on an episode of The Kardashians. “But now, it’s so fun and empowering to just try to do it on my own. And I just wanna make sure that everything is perfect.”
Kim also described Kanye as the “ghost creative director” for SKIMS, the shapewear brand she launched in September 2019.
“We respectfully let each other have our own voices and our own brands and create our own brands,” she told the New York Times in 2020, “but we’re very much together in every last decision and detail that we make.”",2024-04-17T15:02:01Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife

As for Kanye, he opted for an all-white look, wearing a hoodie and lightweight pants. Fans have not been shy to give their feelings on Bianca and Ye, especially when it comes to the outfit choices. The same rings true here, as people online were stunned and upset that she was able to wear such racy attire. According to Mirror, one fan wrote on Instagram, ""Any non-celebrity would not be able to wear that in the parks."" Another added, ""If other people dressed like that they’d make her wear Disney clothes to cover up. BOOOO.""

Säljer ut Yeezy med vinst
Adidas rapporterar en förväntad vinst på 700 miljoner euro för 2024.
Denna positiva prognos är 200 miljoner euro högre än vad som tidigare förutspåddes och kommer efter ett starkt första kvartal med en rörelsevinst på 336 miljoner euro. En betydande ökning från förra årets 60 miljoner.
Adidas har lyckats sälja kvarvarande Yeezy-produkter med vinst och planerar att sälja resterande lager senare under året, dock utan ytterligare vinst.

Företaget har också lovat att donera en del av intäkterna från Yeezy-försäljningen till välgörenhetsorganisationer som arbetar mot hat.
Sunaks koppling till Samba
I en sidohändelse har Adidas och dess Samba-märke fått ytterligare uppmärksamhet den här veckan.
Detta efter att det framkommit att Storbritanniens premiärminister Rishi Sunak varit en trogen kund i många, många år.
Medveten om att hans seriösa image kanske inte uppskattas av andra, yngre Samba-användare, utfärdade Sunak en ursäkt på LBC radio, men betonade att han varit en långvarig anhängare av Adidas-märket.

North West Once Criticized Mom Kim’s Cooking Skills and Said She Prefers Eating at Dad Kanye’s House,"North West, Kim Kardashian's ten-year-old daughter, had some 'harsh' words to say about the SKIMS founder's culinary abilities. In the most recent episode of The Kardashians, North made fun of Kardashian's culinary prowess with a producer when the mother-daughter duo enjoyed some quality time together cooking sushi and fried chicken in their kitchen.
""Can your mom cook?"" inquired the producer. From somewhere in her house, Kardashian could be heard remarking, ""Something smells good already,"" while North shot back at the producer, saying, ""Heck no.""
As per The Mirror, when the Hulu star entered the room, North addressed her, saying, ""Someone is late!"" However, Kardashian admitted that she was unaware that her daughter had come back from a shopping excursion until talking about the incident in a confessional. Kardashian explained to the viewers during the confessional: ""After talking to my eldest sister Kourtney Kardashian, she encouraged me to do small things with my kids like one-on-one cooking stuff. Whatever the kids wanna do and North loves to cook.""

At one point, North was slicing a cucumber while cooking the sushi-themed supper. Kim made fun of her sister Kendall Jenner, who gained notoriety for chopping up the item on an episode from the previous year, remarking, ""Oh wow. FaceTime is a good idea, Aunty Kendall."" During the confessional, Kim talked about her oldest child and spoke of a memory from the most recent episode where they were hanging out at home: ""North is special, smart, and creative."" Kim added: ""And beats to her drum. Like her personality is silly.""

As per OK Magazine, the preteen enjoys being with her dad, Kanye West, more than her mother. “She’ll go to her dad’s. She’ll be like, 'Dad’s the best! He has it all figured out. He doesn’t have a nanny, he doesn’t have a chef, he doesn’t have security, he lives in an apartment,'” the KUWTK alum confessed, mentioning that discussions with North frequently turn sentimental. “And she’ll start crying: 'Why don’t you have an apartment? I can’t believe we don’t have an apartment!""
Kim stated before she added, “I feel like everything falls on the parent that’s more involved.” Kim mentioned that one of the reasons North loved going to Kanye's house is that they cook 'their food' instead of hiring a chef like she does at her place: “That’s amazing that you make ramen, you know?”

As per People, Kim admitted that it was difficult being a single parent: ""I think I'm still learning how to be a single parent. I just did the Jay Shetty podcast where I spoke about parenting, and I mean, I should be used to it by now, but everyone had a lot to say."" She concluded, ""Obviously, having nannies and a chef to help cook is beyond helpful. It's all about family and enjoying these moments. It takes a village to raise kids, but at the end of the day, your kids only want you.""

Bianca Censori's Relative Share Achitect's 'Intimidating' Marital Dynamic with Rapper Kanye West,"A relative of Bianca Censori shed light on the Yeezy architect's relationship dynamic with Kanye West. Their marriage was as unexpected for fans as it was for the Australian's friends and family.
The couple subsequently raised many eyebrows with their bizarre public appearances and head-scratching fashion statements, leading to speculations that West has been ""intimidating"" his wife.
Image Source: Getty Images | Photo by MEGA
On Nova 100's Ben, Liam & Belle Breakfast show, a woman named Sophie claimed her cousin's wife is Bianca's aunt. So, the show's host Liam Stapleton quizzed the family member to enlighten fans and well-wishers (who fear Censori's mental state) about the reality of their marriage, per The Sun.
Stapleton asked, ""They're walking out with wild, wild stuff. Do you know what [the family] makes of all this? Are they sort of like, well,"" admitting, ""this is a bit weird?"" However, to everyone's surprise, Sophie spoke nothing but positive things about Censori and West's personal equation.
Despite everyone's concern, she reassured, ""No, you'd have to ask my cousin's wife about that but all I know is that they're in love, and they're happy."" With her brief response, she quashed all rumors of Ye ""manipulating"" and ""controlling"" Censori into dressing and behaving the way he wanted her to.
But not all members of the Censori family echo with Sophie. Her parents, for instance, thought West ""used"" their daughter as a rebound after his very messy and public divorce from Kim Kardashian. The insiders reported Alexandra and Leo Censori have been extremely worried about their daughter's union with the disgraced rapper, per OK! Magazine.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bianca Censori - West (@biancasensorii)
The source claimed, ""Bianca's mother and father find Kanye to be slightly disturbing. Her parents found it suspect that he married Bianca one month after his divorce from Kim [Kardashian] was finalized. They really didn't want Bianca to be his rebound from such a high-profile marriage.""
After getting married to the Donda rapper, Censori deserted her family for quite some time which further worsened the situation between Ye and his in-laws back in Australia. Their concerns for the architect's safety heightened after they saw their daughter globe-trotting with her husband whose unfiltered anti-semitic remarks offended a whole community.
""Of course, Bianca's parents worry about her jetting all over the world with him, especially when he has gained so many enemies due to his actions,"" added the source. The parents foresaw a possible danger for their child amid their son-in-law's outlandish behavior in public and now it has been reported that Leo (Bianca's father) summoned the couple for a serious sit-down in Australia.
Censori's mother Alexandra visited the 29-year-old recently and voiced some concerns to her husband leading to the invitation. The insider exclusively told Daily Mail, ""Kanye has been invited to go to Australia and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react.""
""Her dad still plans to have a sit down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye's power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits,"" claimed the source.",2024-04-16T11:25:57Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

North, dressed in a colorful tie-dye sweater of green and yellow and clutching a flaming red balloon, posed expertly for one photo. She also wore a headpiece that seemed like it was fashioned after skeletal fingers at another moment while tossing her hair back and forth in the black and white pictures.

"Travels Over Feeling: Arthur Russell, a Life review - down the rabbit hole with a musical maverick","A secret hero of the dancefloor, the avant garde producer and musician Arthur Russell occupies a strange and silvery slot in the annals of music. He was a low-key cult figure in his lifetime, but one who has been increasingly celebrated. His prodigious output and his refusal to have that work pinned down has, in the decades since his death from Aids-related illness in 1992, birthed a small cottage industry of admiration and exegesis: compilations, reissues, covers albums, biographies and even a film. The Barbican in London has given over a night in May to celebrate Russell’s often confounding, genre-spanning work – and the publication of this latest account.
Russell first became a minor legend among clubland cognoscenti thanks to a handful of woozy bangers he put out under names such as Dinosaur L (Go Bang!) and Loose Joints (Pop Your Funk) in the early 1980s – discs spun compulsively at hallowed New York clubs such as the Paradise Garage, before percolating out to Chicago, Ibiza and beyond. Unexpectedly, Kanye West sampled Russell’s tune Answers Me on his 2016 track, 30 Hours – but it wasn’t one of his dancefloor hits. Answers Me is almost gestural, a dub composition for cello, percussion and voice taken from World of Echo, Russell’s 1986 album, a record widely met with bafflement upon release that now occasionally crops up on best-albums-of-all-time lists.
Born Charles Arthur Russell, he made for an unlikely disco pioneer. He grew up a square peg in small-town Iowa. He moved to San Francisco in the late 60s to study classical Indian music and composition and lived in a Buddhist commune. Those foundational ideals would inform his work over the long term.
He remained commercially unsung thanks to a dogged loyalty to his art that brooked no compromise
Russell first found renown accompanying fellow Buddhist Allen Ginsberg’s poetry readings on the cello; that friendship (possibly with benefits, early on) would also last for the rest of Russell’s life. He was spectacularly well connected throughout his career – he was a friend of A&R man John Hammond, discoverer of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen; he played for Alice Coltrane and with Laurie Anderson. But he remained commercially unsung thanks to a dogged loyalty to his art that brooked no compromise with genre expectations, or the grunt work of getting famous. He was prickly, once leaving a band on their way to a gig. “I’m on another thought now,” run the words to Another Thought, one of his loveliest cello-and-vocals songs, tilting at the restlessness of his output.
Uprooting himself to New York in 1973, Russell moved in the city’s icy avant garde and minimalist circles, programming events in a space called the Kitchen where leftfield music and multimedia art rubbed together. If San Francisco was the place to be in the late 60s, New York was the centre of progressive creativity in the 70s, when the city’s unkempt corners nurtured countless talents. Russell nearly joined Talking Heads; at The Kitchen, he put on bands such as the Modern Lovers, annoying the avant purists.
But the wider punk scene was not much to Russell’s taste; its nihilism clashed with his more expansive consciousness. Instead, he became enamoured of the nonlinear, ever-evolving possibilities of repetitive music outside the lofty realm of theory. New York clubland became his laboratory.

Alongside experiments destined for the dancefloor, Russell continued to record sparer electro-acoustic compositions, all the while soundtracking austere dance or theatre pieces, earning the respect of composer Philip Glass and playing in various ensembles. He could also turn his hand to relatively conventional singer-songwriter material – witness the posthumously released Love Is Overtaking Me album – but Instrumentals, a 1984 rendering of a Russell composition from a decade prior, with modular parts that musicians could theoretically begin at random points in the score, is perhaps more typical.
Making umpteen mixes of every song, Russell kept everything: great news for those interested in going down the rabbit hole. Richard King, whose works span numerous music titles (How Soon Is Now, about UK independent labels; The Lark Ascending, about the British landscape in music) is a superfan who came of age working in record shops, where obscure artists constituted a special kind of common currency. King has been given access to Russell’s considerable archive, housed in the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, to compile this intimate coffee-table tome: an array of his letters, written in careful pencil, plus event flyers, scores and charts, sleeve artwork and cool ephemera (numerological workings-out, invoices for studio time). The visuals are linked to oral-history style accounts from intimates and contemporaries, including Rough Trade’s Geoff Travis, whose funding helped keep Russell afloat, and printer Tom Lee, his life partner.
It helps to be an admirer of this singular talent. But even if Russell’s work is unfamiliar to the reader, there is a fascination, between these covers, with the flotsam of a very 20th-century life at the cutting edge of culture in a New York that no longer exists. The last quarter of the book takes an inevitable dark turn, as downtown’s creative circles become affected by HIV – Russell is diagnosed in 1986 – and artists of all kinds begin dying. The fear, silence and shame of those early days of the virus is once again alive in these pages.
King’s moving account keeps you guessing as to how the cornfields of Iowa birthed such a curious (in both senses) musician; one tangential clue might be that the house Russell grew up in was designed by his uncle, a modernist architect who studied under Frank Lloyd Wright. There are hand-wringing interjections by Russell’s sisters, who confess to not having understood him, but still loved him, and sewed special pockets on his shirts for his notebooks. The loftiness and singular nature of his work mean that its heterogeneity and distrait tenderness still remain hard to parse. But Travels Over Feeling provides a valuable set of insights into one man’s monomaniacal dedication to music.",2024-04-15T06:00:14Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
"Trotz Schlagzeilen: Bianca Censori ist mit Kanye ""glücklich""","Seitdem sie mit Kanye West (46) verheiratet ist, sorgt Bianca Censori (29) immer wieder für Schlagzeilen – vor allem mit ihren freizügigen Outfits. Böse Zungen behaupten immer wieder, dass der Rapper die Looks seiner Frau aussuche und sie damit kontrollieren wolle. Eine entfernte Verwandte der Architektin scheint den Spekulationen nun aber entgegenwirken zu wollen. ""Aber alles, was ich weiß, ist, dass sie verliebt und glücklich sind"", beteuerte sie in der australischen Radioshow ""Ben, Liam & Belle"" gegenüber den Hosts.
Vor allem Biancas Vater Leo Censori soll sich Sorgen um seine Tochter machen. Ein Insider behauptete gegenüber Daily Mail, dass er befürchtet, dass der 46-Jährige Bianca von ihrer Familie isoliert, sie gleichzeitig aber in der Öffentlichkeit zur Schau stellt. Für Leo sei es, als würde Kanye seine Ehefrau als ""billige nackte Trophäe"" darstellen. Deswegen soll er seinen Schwiegersohn aufgefordert haben, ihn in Australien zu besuchen, um dort ein klärendes Gespräch zu führen. ""Ihr Vater hat vor, ein ernstes Wort mit Kanye zu reden. Leo wird sich nicht von Kanyes Erfolg einschüchtern lassen und ihm die Stirn bieten"", erklärte ein weiterer Insider gegenüber dem Medium.
Doch nicht nur Biancas Familie, sondern auch Kanyes Ex und Mutter seiner vier Kinder, Kim Kardashian (43), soll von den Outfits der Australierin nicht begeistert sein – besonders wenn Bianca mit Chicago (6), Saint (8), North (10) und Psalm (4) unterwegs ist. ""Kim hat Kanye angewiesen, dass Bianca sich niemals in der Nähe ihrer Kinder so kleiden darf"", verriet ein Insider ebenfalls im Gespräch mit Daily Mail. Wie Bilder, die dem Medium vorlagen, kürzlich zeigten, hält sich Bianca auch an die Forderungen der The Kardashians-Bekanntheit: Bei einem Bummel mit North trug sie eine oversized Lederjacke, ein lockeres Sweatshirt sowie eine dunkle Strumpfhose.
Nach acht Jahren Ehe und vier gemeinsamen Kindern hatten Kim und Kanye 2021 ihre Trennung bekannt gegeben. Danach versuchte der Musiker, seine Ex etliche Male von einem Liebescomeback zu überzeugen. Umso überraschender war es dann, dass Kanye vor zwei Jahren Bianca heiratete. Sie war zuvor Mitarbeiterin in seiner Firma. Und auch mit ihr möchte der Musiker anscheinend Nachwuchs – zumindest deutete er das in seinem neuen Song ""Timbo Freestyle"" an. ""Ihr wisst bereits, dass ich impulsiv bin und ein weiteres Baby mein Ziel ist"", rappt Kanye.

Israels Star-Geigerin Miri Ben-Ari: So geigte ich Kanye West in die Charts,"Miri Ben-Ari gehört zu den besten Geigerinnen der Welt, ihre Karriere startete sie u. a. mit Skandal-Rapper Kanye West
Star-Geigerin Miri Ben-Ari (52) ist es schwer ums Herz! Der Konflikt in ihrer Heimat Israel bedrückt die Grammy-Gewinnerin. Doch sie kämpft mit ihren Mitteln für Verständigung. Mit Musik! BILD hat mit der Virtuosin gesprochen, die bereits mit Skandal-Rapper Kanye West (46) Erfolge feierte.
Das Schicksal der Geiseln, die am 7. Oktober von der Hamas verschleppt wurden, lässt auch Ben-Ari nicht los. Sie zu BILD: „Dieser Krieg ist herzzerreißend. Eine der Geiseln, Agam Berger, ist eine 19-jährige Geigerin. Sie wurde von der Terrorgruppe Hamas brutal entführt und nach Angaben anderer Geiseln, die aus dem Gazastreifen zurückgekehrt sind, in einem dunklen Tunnel gefangen gehalten, wo sie höchstwahrscheinlich Opfer sexueller Gewalt wurde.“
Miri Ben-Ari zu BILD: „Es ist wirklich erschütternd. Wir brauchen mehr Liebe, Mitgefühl und Harmonie in dieser Welt“
Sie fühlt mit und spürt eine Verbindung zu Agam Berger: „Da sie wie ich Geige spielt, hat mich diese Geschichte sehr berührt. Ich bete für sie, für alle Geiseln und ihre Familien und für alle Palästinenser und Israelis, die Opfer dieser unmenschlichen Terrorgruppe Hamas geworden sind, die den Nahen Osten in einen Krieg verwickelt hat.“
Sie liebt es, auf der Bühne zu stehen: „Meine Live-Performances wurden durch die unzähligen Auftritte und Kollaborationen mit so vielen renommierten Künstlern geprägt. Das hat meine Grenzen von der klassischen Welt bis zur Bühne des Apollo in New York und sogar bis ins Weiße Haus verschoben“
Das sagt sie über Kanye West
In den USA hat Ben-Ari ihre Karriere mit viel Erfolg zum Blühen gebracht. Besonders die Zusammenarbeit mit Musik-Produzent Kanye West , der heute mehr mit Negativ-Schlagzeilen und antisemitischen auffällt, hat ihr geholfen. So verbreitete West unter anderem Verschwörungstheorien über Juden und erklärte, dass er Hitler möge und die Nazis liebe. Negative Kommentare über den Rapper spart sich Ben-Ari aber dennoch.
2004 in New York: Miri Ben-Ari zusammen mit Kanye West auf der Bühne beim „The New Life Project Inaugural Concert“
Ben-Ari: „Ich habe mit Kanye West an den kultigen Alben „The College Dropout“ und „Late Registration“ gearbeitet. Ich liebe diese Alben, die zu den Klassikern gehören. Ich habe einen Grammy für den Song „Jesus Walks“ gewonnen. Wie viele Geiger können schließlich sagen, dass sie von Kanye West das Produzieren gelernt haben?“
Und weiter: „Ich habe viele Stunden im Studio mit Kanye (jetzt Ye) verbracht und an seinen Alben, meinem Album und den Alben vieler Künstler gearbeitet. Gemeinsam haben wir Songs geschaffen, die den Test der Zeit bestanden haben und als Klassiker gelten.“
Am Samstag wird die Virtuosin beim „ID Festival“ in Berlin auftreten. Mit ihrem Konzert „Symphony of Brotherhood“ spielt sie für Mitgefühl und Harmonie.",2024-04-12T08:19:50Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD
Kanye West's Relationship with Bianca Censori 'Finally Defined' in 'Breakthrough Moment',"Kanye West's recent public appearance alongside his wife, Bianca Censori, has sparked speculation about the state of their relationship. Some experts suggest that this outing might signify a significant turning point for the couple. The couple was spotted out and about on Wednesday night, with the YEEZY architect sporting an extremely provocative outfit.
The husband and wife duo was seen attending Ty Dolla $ign's birthday party in West Hollywood recently. Censori, 29, was dressed in a costume quite similar to what her 46-year-old husband's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, wore when she was newly married to West.

Body language expert Judi James said that the current exhibition might have been a ""breakthrough moment"" for Censori and West after examining their body language during their last outing. James commented, ""Bianca’s plunging white tunic might bear a passing resemblance to Kim’s own plunging version while she was married to Kanye but the spirit of the look is far more twinned with the ‘napkin’ dress Kim wore to the Oscars after-party earlier this year."" ""The striking feature of this outing though is the way that Kanye has finally decided to come as a co-ordinated partner that would define him and Bianca as a couple, rather than dressing and using body language that is in direct contrast to anything his wife is doing or wearing"" She continued, saying, ""Postural echo or mirroring like Kanye and Bianca are doing here suggests like-minded thinking and a desire to be seen as exclusive,"" as per The Mirror.

According to recent claims made by an insider, West and his wife Censori are determined to become parents and are working hard to make that happen. “Kanye definitely wants another child and says Bianca will be an amazing mother. She’s actually really good with his kids. They’re actively trying to get pregnant,"" said the insider. Kardashian, Ye's ex-wife, is on board with the plan, thus the four kids of the former marriage may be getting a half-sibling. ""Even Kim’s OK with it. She knows that Kanye is all about having as many children as he can"" the insider explained. Connecting the dots, this could be the reason they appear more united than ever.
In December 2022, Ye and Bianca tied the knot, one month after his divorce from Kim was officially formalized. She has gained popularity for donning increasingly provocative attire in public, many of which are sheer. A source that Bianca's nearly-naked wardrobe choices are not within Ye's control, despite some fans' worries to the contrary. The source disclosed, ""Bianca is extremely intelligent, well-educated and beyond ambitious. This idea that she’s some sort of victim is way off the mark. She’s absolutely loving the attention she creates by baring her body in public,"" as per Yahoo.",2024-04-12T07:53:16Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Bianca Censori Looked Visibly Distressed as She Walked Nearly 'Barefoot' With Kanye West at LA Party,"Bianca Censori draws attention with each new ensemble she wears, her latest outing in LA with her husband Kanye West was for a private celebration in West Hollywood. The all-white event was organized to honor Ty Dolla $ign, who worked with West on his most recent album, Vultures, on his 42nd birthday. The former model wore a short dress that featured a plunging neckline, showing off her tanned legs and endless cleavage. Her bare feet appeared to have been taped onto the black platforms she walked on, adding to the ensemble's unusual look. Censori wore her hair in slicked-back style and used natural, dewy makeup to draw attention to her sharp facial features. Despite her striking outfit, Censori appeared timid as she arrived at the birthday celebration. She did not smile and looked visually distressed while entering the party venue.

The Donda rapper on the other hand sported a white t-shirt with short sleeves that showed off his forearm tattoos. West complimented the ensemble with large Timberland boots and matched the shirt with relaxed sweatpants. As per The US Sun, the famed couple came under heavy criticism last week when Censori was the only one wearing a provocative skintight silver catsuit while being on a dinner outing with West's kids. One fan harshly commented on Reddit, saying, ""It feels so f**ked that these kids are exposed the way they are."" ""She looks so miserable and who wouldn't be, dressed like a f**king fembot going to get ice cream with your 'beloved' husband's kids,"" a second fan wrote.

Along with the concerns expressed by fans that Kanye is attempting to control or humiliate his wife through her outrageous attire, her father Leo is said to have stated that he plans to speak with Kanye about the issue. Insiders indicate that Censori is all in with the Flashing Lights rapper, despite warnings from fans and her own family to the contrary. “Bianca is in her element. She loves the attention and being dressed by Ye, despite what everyone thinks of her outfits. She feels a lot of her looks are artistic, not just about the fashion."" ""Bianca is fully dedicated and in it for the long haul, she doesn’t care what people think of her,"" another celebrity source revealed.

""I wouldn't be surprised if she got pregnant soon and she'll still wear revealing outfits the same as Rihanna did,"" the sources said, implying that the young Yeezy architect wants to have children with Kanye.

Why Late Night Host Jimmy Kimmel Said Online Feud with Kanye West Made Him 'So Happy',"Jimmy Kimmel feuded with controversial rapper Kanye West back in 2013, and apparently, the online clash made him 'happy.' The late-night host of Jimmy Kimmel Live! was at odds with Ye on X, formerly Twitter. While a public feud would cause stress to some, Kimmel, surprisingly, was beaming with joy, according to GQ.

As part of the 2018 cover story for the outlet, the 56-year-old recalled, ""I live for moments like that,"" referring to his 2013 social media exchange with West. ""When I got in a Twitter battle with Kanye, I was so happy. My wife makes fun of me. She's like, 'You are so happy right now.' I'm absolutely beaming. I feel very confident in a situation like that.""
The drama began when Kimmel did a parody sketch on his late-night show of West's BBC interview where the rapper boasted he's the 'No. 1 rock star on the planet.' The video spoof didn't go down well with Ye, who blasted the host on X with a series of scathing tweets, cussing and trashing him.

""JIMMY KIMMEL IS OUT OF LINE TO TRY AND SPOOF IN ANY WAY THE FIRST PIECE OF HONEST MEDIA IN YEARS,"" wrote the rapper, followed by some NSFW references. Among other things, Ye further slammed Kimmel by calling him a ""manipulative media motherf—,"" as per Billboard. However, in true Kimmel fashion, the late-night host took the Praise God rapper's comments lightly and humorously addressed the feud in his show's opening monologue. ""Finally, I'm in a rap feud,"" he quipped, ""I always wanted to be in a rap feud."" The comedian also revealed that before coming for the show, he received a call from West demanding a public apology.
""I am the most powerful voice in media,"" Ye declared before warning, ""You will never be able to show your face at a 14-year-old's high school football game and be cool again."" But Kimmel is a pro in handling such dire situations and consequently, the two even ended their verbal melee when the rapper appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! After nearly 5 years of the online clash, Ye and Kimmel decided to let bygones be bygones. The host told GQ, ""You take a risk when you make a comment that is dark,"" referring to his joke on West. ""In a way, it's you saying, 'I trust you. I trust your sense of humor, and I trust that you will not use this against me.' It's a little gift, I think.""
He added, ""When somebody makes a truly offensive joke to me, I love them a little bit more. If it's just offensive, it's no good. But there's nothing better than when something emotional or serious is going on, maybe it's a wedding toast, and somebody funny leans over and whispers something terrible into your ear."" He concluded, ""I live for those moments,"" said Kimmel. ""I live for being the one who does the whispering.""",2024-04-12T02:00:03Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Kanye West drops price tag on Malibu Mansion slashing $14m bid,"Kanye West has adjusted the asking price of his gutted Malibu mansion, reducing it from $53 million to $39 million, as reported by TMZ on Thursday.
The decision comes less than four months after the property's initial listing in the upscale oceanfront community.
Partnering with Selling Sunset realtor Jason Oppenheim, he aimed to attract buyers to the distressed property, which has faced challenges amid controversies stemming from remarks made since late 2022.
He expressed optimism about the sale, describing the residence as a ""blank canvas"" for potential buyers.
Spanning over 4,000 square feet, the home boasts four bedrooms and five bathrooms, offering scenic views of the Pacific Ocean.
However, it currently lacks essential features such as windows, walls, a roof, and electricity, according to TMZ reports.
West's ambitious renovation plans for his mansion have stirred controversy, resulting in a lawsuit filed by former project manager Tony Saxon.
Saxon alleges that he was dismissed from the project after voicing concerns about safety hazards associated with West's vision, which reportedly included transforming the residence into a ""bomb shelter from the 1910s.""
The lawsuit, lodged in Los Angeles County Superior Court, outlines Saxon's extensive involvement in the project since September 2021, where he worked tirelessly in multiple roles, including project manager, caretaker, and security personnel.",2024-04-11T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Bianca Censori Wears Low Plunging V-Neck Dress With Kanye West,"Bianca Censori continues to defy fashion! Kanye “Ye” West‘s wife, 29, was spotted on a date with the rapper, 46, while reportedly attending Ty Dolla $ign‘s birthday event in Los Angeles on Wednesday, April 10. For the night out, Bianca wore a white, deep plunging V-neck mini dress with clear sandals.
Per photos published by Page Six, Ye matched her style with an all-white outfit. Earlier this week, Bianca made headlines for wearing a completely see-through latex dress. She appeared to have no underwear underneath the frock and accessorized with red tights and matching high heels.
The famous spouses — who have been married since December 2022 — have experimented with fashion over the past year. Despite breakup rumors surfacing in late 2023, Bianca and Ye have seemingly been going strong. From simple L.A. evening dates to casual afternoon strolls, the A-list couple aren’t afraid to walk by the cameras whenever paparazzi and fans spot them.
As Bianca’s fashion game continues, though, her family’s concern about her marriage has reportedly heightened. Earlier this year, the Aussie’s father, Leo, wanted to have a conversation with the “Stronger” rapper to talk about Bianca’s clothing.
“Kanye has been invited to go to Australia, and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react,” Daily Mail reported. “Her dad still plans to have a sit-down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye’s power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits.”
Despite how the source told the outlet that Ye “has started to turn things around since the release of Vultures in the sense that he is not going off on as many unhinged rants,” Leo and Bianca’s mother, Alexandra, are still worried, according to the insider. Alexandra even visited Bianca in the U.S., the source added.
“This has been a wonderful opportunity for Alexandra to get to spend time with Bianca and assess the situation for herself,” the insider added. “Yes, Bianca dressed provocatively while her mother was there, but it was nothing in comparison to some of the outfits she has worn prior to and since the visit.”
Neither Bianca nor Ye has publicly discussed the rumors of her family’s concern.",2024-04-11T17:22:48Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife

Bianca Censori est-elle officiellement devenue la nouvelle Kim Kardashian ? Mariée à Kanye West depuis décembre 2022, la jeune femme âgée de 29 ans seulement intrigue autant qu’elle fascine. Il faut dire que sa ressemblance avec la star de télé-réalité est vraiment frappante. Mêmes formes, mêmes mimiques et visage on ne peut plus similaire, il est parfois difficile de les différencier et nombreux sont les internautes à s’emmêler les pinceaux.
Bianca Censori méconnaissable depuis son histoire avec Kanye West
Il faut dire que la jeune femme, qui travaillait auparavant en tant qu’architecte en Australie, fait tout pour ressembler à l’ex de son mari. Avant de rencontrer Kanye West, celle-ci arborait une belle et longue chevelure brune et s’habillait de manière assez classique. Bianca Censori a bien changé depuis. Talons aiguilles, pantalons transparents, poitrine à l’air, absence de sous-vêtements… La jeune femme n’est plus la même. Un retournement de situation que même ses propres parents n’avaient pas vu venir.
Lors d’un précédent entretien accordé au Daily Mail, une source a révélé que la mère et le père de Bianca étaient offusqués de la découvrir vêtue ainsi au quotidien. « Sa famille et ses amis sont choqués parce que la situation ne fait qu’empirer. Bianca ne réalise clairement pas que ce qu’elle portait n’est pas seulement dégoûtant et donne le mauvais exemple, mais qu’elle enfreint également potentiellement la loi ». Et de poursuivre : « Elle ne ferait pas cela si elle n’était pas contrôlée. Il continue de l’enfermer en l’impliquant davantage sur divers projets qu’il a en cours, y compris les vêtements ».
Une robe très révélatrice
Cette fois-ci pourtant, Bianca Censori a fait plus « soft » en matière de garde-robe. Présente à l’anniversaire de Ty Dolla $ign à West Hollywood ce mercredi 10 avril 2024 en compagnie de Kanye West, la jeune femme a opté pour une robe blanche courte et ouverte jusqu’au nombril, laissant apparaître de nouveau sa poitrine. Si ce look a certainement de quoi faire parler, c’est surtout sa ressemblance avec Kim Kardashian qui attire l’œil.

Bianca Censori : la copie conforme de Kim Kardashian
Comme vous pouvez le voir sur ces quelques photos comparatives partagées par le Daily Mail, les deux femmes sont une fois de plus des copies conformes. D’ailleurs, Bianca semble clairement avoir (encore) copié Kim qui portait une robe très similaire lors de son 34ème anniversaire au club Tao de Las Vegas il y a 10 ans. Une chose est sûre, les looks extravagants de la jeune femme ne plaisent pas et les commentaires sont toujours là pour nous le rappeler. « On dirait une robe de chambre d’hôpital à l’envers », « C’est la seule fois où je l’ai vue habillée », « Une robe ? C’est juste un bout de tissu sans forme », pouvait-on notamment lire parmi les réactions. Traduction : Bianca a encore du boulot.",2024-04-11T15:20:59Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
Kanye West Shows Off Slim Figure As Biance Censori Sports Dress With Plunging Neckline,"Kanye West and Bianca Censori have been attached at the hip as of late. Overall, they have been spending all of their time together, and it seems like that they are very much in love. After all, they are married, and only couples who truly enjoy each other's company would spend that much time together. While there have been questions about the couple's authenticity, it does seem like those questions shouldn't exist anymore. Ye and Censori are going strong, and his fans are happy for him.
Last night, Kanye and Censori were out at a party in Los Angeles. It seemed to be a pretty good time, and the two were dressed to match. In photos posted online, Ye could be seen wearing an all-white outfit, while Censori had on the same colors. When it came to Censori's outfit, she had on a plunging neckline dress that was quite boxy. Overall, it is pretty well in line with some of the other outfits that Censori has been rocking over the past few months.

"Cele mai șocante apariții ale soției lui Kanye West. Bianca Censori a apărut de mai multe ori aproape dezbrăcată în public, fără nicun fel de lenjerie intimă / FOTO","CITEȘTE TOATĂ REVISTA VIVA DE MARTIE, GRATIS, AICI!
Bianca Censori a șocat opinia publică și nu odată, ci în repetate rânduri și după ce mulți au observat cât de stânjenită apare în anumite ocazii. Aatfel, aparițiile sale indecente s-au pus pe seama soțului ei. Apropiații tinerei susțin că, de fapt, în spatele alegerilor ținutelor sale ar sta Kanye West, care o controlează din toate punctele de vedere, întreaga strategie fiind parte dintr-un plan pentru a-și pune în umbră fosta soție, pe Kim Kardashian.

Cele mai șocante apariții ale soției lui Kanye West
De-a lungul timpului, Bianca Censori a apărut îmbrăcată sumar în Los Angeles, când a recreat un look ce ducea mai degrabă cu gândul la Kim Kardashian, cu sutien și fustă extrem de scurtă, cu vedere la lenjeria intimă, de culoare gri metalizat. A asortat o pereche de sandale argintii la întreaga ținută, precum și un make-up în aceeași nuanță.
Cu altă ocazie, Bianca a apărut la shopping în Franța îmbrăcată în colanți transparenți în timpul unei sesiuni de shopping, după care a riscat inclusiv închisoarea. Conform codului penal, fiind ilegal să expui „părți intime ale corpului la vedere într-un spațiu accesibil publicului', fapt care s-ar pedepsi cu un an de închisoare și o amendă de 15.000 de euro.
Cu altă ocazie, a apărut într-un body albastru-turcoaz și dresuri albe de dantelă, ținută ce a costat 835 de dolari. „Bianca a făcut alegeri ciudate care nu sunt nicidecum măgulitoare, cool sau sofisticate. Nu au niciun sens alegerile ei vestimentare. Kanye este putred de bogat, așa că ar putea fi mai inspirată cu privire la ce poartă și ar trebui să opteze pentru o gamă mai deiversificată de haine, indiferent de mesajul pe care vrea să-l transmită', a declarat stilista Amanda Sanders.
Altă dată, în schimb, a purtat boxeri Prada de aproape 900 de dolari, la care a asortat un maieu transparent, într-o nuanță asemănătoare, desigur fără sutien, cu sânii la vedere sau a purtat pur și simplu o pernă de culoare mov în partea de sus și dresuri în partea de jos.
Bianca a tot ținut primele pagini ale ziarelor cu aparițiile sale controversate, de cele mai multe ori fiind în sutien și dresuri, de diverse culori – nu a evitat nici chiar culorile tari, care atrag atenția, etalându-și silueta în toată splendoarea.
La polul opus, au existat și dăți în care Bianca Censori a apărut îmbrăcată din cap până în picioare, mulți chiar fără să-și dea seama cine se ascunde în spatele unei haine voluminoase de blană, animal print.
Bianca Censori, ținută controversată de peste 4000 de dolari
Una dintre cele mai scumpe ținute cu care s-a afișat Bianca Censori, când a întors multe capete, a costat 4.050 de dolari. Atunci a optat pentru o salopetă animal print, un trenci transparent Balenciaga, de culoare bej și cizme negre, decupate în față, Miu Miu, ce costă 2.100 de dolari.
„Topurile, body-urile, cizmele și dresurile sunt puțin ciudate', a comentat la acel moment stilista Tavia Sharp pentru The U.S Sun, sugerând că Bianca ar trebui să apeleze la serviciile unui stilist, în loc să asculte sfaturile soțului ei.
„Este o linie foarte fina intre cei care cred ca ea e controlata de soț si cei care spun ca Bianca este complice”
Mark Borkowki, care se numără printre cei mai cunoscuți PR din Marea Britanie, si-a spus parerea avizata pentru Daily Mail.
Kanye intelege foarte bine cum functioneaza controversa si incearca sa ‘rupa internetul. Cred ca multi oameni incep sa se simta inconfortabil, in ciuda a tot ceea ce spune el, despre faptul ca poate face ce vrea cu partenera lui. Este o linie foarte fina intre cei care cred ca ea este controlata de el si cei care spun ca Bianca este complice si este dedicata acestui ‘circ. Chiar este un spectacol ciudat in care toata lumea este implicata, iar unii chiar se bucura de aceste poze explicite. Daca in viitor va aparea o ruptura intre ei, cred ca ne vom uita inapoi la aceste iamgini cu alti ochi si ne vom da seama ca a ea a fost exploatata', a declarat Mark Borkowki.

Bianca Censori took a page out of Kim Kardashian’s style playbook for Ty Dolla $ign’s birthday party in LA Wednesday night.
The Yeezy architect wore a plunging white minidress that showed off her skin from her neck to her navel while her husband, Kanye West, wore an all-white outfit consisting of a T-shirt, jeans and Timberland boots.
Censori, 29, paired her risqué look with a pair of heeled sandals.

The Australian beauty’s look was reminiscent of the “Kardashian” star’s Alexandre Vauthier dress and Givenchy sandals that she wore for her 34th birthday party at Tao Las Vegas.
Kardashian’s frock also featured a plunging torso, although it ruched in the middle, and finished off with statement shoulders. The SKKN by Kim founder’s birthday that year took place just months after she had married West.
Fans have noticed that Censori and Kardashian, 43, have a tendency to mirror each other’s style, as West has served as both of their mentors.

Earlier this year, followers accused Kardashian of copying Censori’s look when she donned a fur hat that was similar to the one West’s current wife wore to an event in Dubai.
“It’s giving Bianca,” one person commented on Kardashian’s Instagram post.

How Kanye West and Kim Kardashian’s Kids React to Bianca Censori’s Bold Fashion Choices,"Kanye West and Kim Kardashian’s family dynamics have come under the spotlight yet again, this time focusing on the surprising reactions of their children to their stepmom Bianca Censori’s daring fashion statements. Censori, who tied the knot with West in a private ceremony in 2022, has been making waves with her sheer and almost nude ensembles, igniting both fascination and controversy among fans and family alike. Censori has not been hesitant to flaunt her figure in skintight sheer outfits, often leaving little to the imagination. While some fans have raised eyebrows at her bold choices, surprisingly, it turns out that West and Kardashian’s children—North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm—are more amused than embarrassed by their stepmother’s fashion.

According to insiders close to the family, “The kids think Bianca is cool, but some of her outfits are eyebrow-raisers. They giggle about some of the more revealing things she wears, but they do like her.” Kardashian, who was skeptical about Censori’s risqué style, has reportedly made peace with it as she knows how her ex-husband West can be. The insider shared, ""I know that the clothes Ye makes Bianca wear does trouble [Kim], mostly because of the kids. But Kim really does wish Ye and Bianca nothing but the best.""

Recent escapades of West and Censori have caught public attention, with Censori flaunting see-through dresses and barely there outfits with a sleek hairdo. These fashion choices have fueled discussions among fans, speculating the future outfits West will be styling Censori in. Moreover, as per sources, Kardashian has asked West to ensure Censori 'covers up' around the kids. As per The Sun, a source revealed, “Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids. She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.”

On top of that, there is speculation within the close circles that West’s influence is transforming Censori, but not in a good way. An insider shared, “Everyone is extremely concerned. This isn’t who she is. She is an incredibly outspoken and lively person who is never one to keep her mouth shut. Kanye is trying to make Bianca into a radicalized version of Kim — almost like Kim 2.0. The difference is that when Kim was with Kanye he was respected in the fashion world. He has since lost this respect,” as reported by She Knows.

The insider further added, “Kanye did the same thing he is doing with Bianca to Kim throughout their marriage. The difference is that when Kanye dressed Kim, he was respected as a person — as an artist. Unfortunately, Kim knows what Bianca is going through — but she feels Bianca should have known what she was getting into.”",2024-04-11T06:38:43Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Ryan Garcia Goes Nuclear On Kanye West For Allegedly Refusing To Walk Him Out Over ""No Diddy"" Tweet","Boxing star Ryan Garcia has just gone off the rails on X over some new beef with Kanye West. According to HipHopDX, it all began when the 25-year-old sent out a tweet to 50 Cent on April 3. He asked the New York rap icon to walk out with him for his upcoming fight on April 20 with Devin Haney. In that request he also said, ""no Diddy,"" as a reference to the running jokes surrounding the sexual assault allegations of the mogul. ""@50cent would be awesome if you walked out with me 4-20 No diddy Let’s do this!!!!"" Garcia presumably asked the same of Kanye, but he allegedly believes that the VULTURES MC ""said no"" because of the jab at Diddy.
This lit a raging fire inside the young boxer and it led him to send at least 16 vicious verbal attacks toward Kanye. It all began with this post, ""Why Kanye mad at me for saying “no diddy” He lost it when he said he was the New Jesus."" From there the tweets began to snowball and increase in absurdity. For example, Garcia went as far as to claim that, ""I heard Kim puts her finger in Kanye b** allegedly🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️""

Some of the deleted tweets might be even more wild. ""Let’s be real, right drake F***ED your girl ""Kim"" moved to the house next to you. Then she dates Pete Davidson. And then you get a look alike to Kim ""Bianca"". And then you have the nerve to say you the new Jesus. LMFAO you are a bum facts."" Garcia also calls out Kanye's die-hard supporters, saying, ""bro supported a genocide for a whole group and y'all defend him"" and that it ""is actually sad."" In another gut punch, the lightweight boxer says the Georgia-born native is ""defending diddy bc that’s his daddy."" Kanye has yet to respond to any of these tweets and confirm if Garcia's claim is true.
What are your thoughts on Ryan Garcia exploding on Kanye West on Twitter (X)? Do you see Kanye responding to this in any capacity, why or why not? Why do you think the rapper allegedly changed his tune about Diddy? We would like to hear what you have to say, so be sure to leave your takes in the comments section.

For a while, it seemed like Ryan Garcia had moved away from his frantic tweets! However, as the fight date against Devin Haney inches closer, the Victorville native seems to have found a new topic to tweet about. What’s he tweeting about now? Well, Kanye West, the popular rapper, seems to be his latest target, as Garcia roped in Kim Kardashian.
Earlier today, a clip from The Spit Bucket Podcast revealed that ‘Ye’ had declined Garcia’s request to walk him out during the Haney fight. Garcia claimed that the pop star was bothered by his comments on Diddy. While there’s no evidence that Garcia’s latest tweets against ‘Ye’ are because of that reason, the timing does feel very suspicious.

Turning to X, Garcia wrote, “Kanye thought he was invisible. He cool but when you say the things you say. Then it will come back around. You really loved Kim and you lost her. Pete had her that’s sad. Carnival helped you. Still you really defending someone that the feds on, and the crazy thing is you told everyone about him. And now you changed your tune bc you exalted your self higher then God you aren’t God no One cares about Kanye anymore.”
It’s worth mentioning that this wasn’t the end of Garcia’s attacks on West. In a later tweet, Garcia wrote, “F**K KANYE WEST.” Moreover, he took to X one more time to slander West by calling him a fool. Garcia wrote, “You lose billionaire status. Then you blame everyone. Not accountability. He think is smart he is a fool. “KANYE West.”

With just ten days left in his fight against ‘The Dream’ Haney, Garcia appeared in the media day workout for the upcoming fight. Following all his erratic behavior on X, many, including Haney, have accused Garcia of using drugs. So, during his media day workout, Garcia sent a scathing message to Haney.
He said, “At the end of the day, I know damn well you tried to say all that s**t about me and it all came back to you. You and your daddy, you guys are hypocrites. That don’t matter in the ring, I’m going to beat your a**, I guarantee you 420 it’s on.” Later in the interview, Garcia even shared his prediction for the fight, saying, “I’m going to knock you the f**k out in front of the world.”

Bianca Censori's Recent Fashion Choices Seems Inspired by Kanye West's '2013 Yeezus Tour' Dancers,"Bianca Censori's racy outfits created much buzz already but it seems the architect has been drawing inspiration from her husband Kanye West's 2013 musical tour Yeezus. Her trend-setting fashion choices, however bizarre they may appear, are a lot similar to the dancers at Ye's past tours.

The Australian has been making a statement every time she steps out with her husband. Although she's rarely appreciated and mostly critiqued, her bold fashion sense cannot go unnoticed. While many people blamed West for ""manipulating"" her into dressing the way he wanted, lately, her barely-there outfits seemed a revived version of the rapper's past concerts, per The Sun.
The 46-year-old married his former Yeezy employee in a hush-hush ceremony in December 2022 and ever since, they have been globe-trotting, attending musical events and fashion shows while casually walking through the streets of foreign lands grabbing eyeballs and creating controversies with Censori's body on full display.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bianca Censori - West (@biancasensorii)
In the past months, the 29-year-old was seen in sheer, skintight bodysuits, pants, and tiny dresses in pastel/neutral shades. The couple has been photographed in some of the major cities like Rome, Miami, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Dubai. On several occasions, Censori was spotted completely braless and even sans underwear over transparent lacy outfits.
If fans could relive the past, the couple's fashion inspiration is highly influenced by Ye's Yeezus tour aesthetics. The background dancers of the rapper were dressed the same way as Censori. West, these days, covers his face with different masks. Similarly, he sported the iconic Maison Margiela mask throughout his 2013 tour, resembling his current fashion sense.
While the Praise God rapper still has the same all-black style (from his 2013 tour), which he seldom switches, it is worth noting that Censori's fashion sense has shifted to a complete 180 after she tied the knot with West. The backup dancers wore sheer masks and figure-hugging catsuits similar to what the architect has been flaunting lately.

West announced The Yeezus Tour, a 23-city trek throughout North America, opened on October 19, 2013, in Seattle and concluded on December 7, 2013, in Houston, with Kendrick Lamar opening all 5 shows, per Billboard. Yeezus was Ye's first solo trek since his last back in 2008, Glow in the Dark tour.
Yeezus debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 selling 327,000 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It also marked West's sixth No. 1 album and sixth straight chart-topper, after his successful album in collaboration with Jay Z.

Kanye West’s Wife Bianca Censori Ditches Underwear in Sheer Dress,"Bianca Censori continues to up the ante in her fashion game. While stepping out with her husband, Kanye “Ye” West, during a recent outing, the 29-year-old Aussie was photographed wearing a completely see-through strapless dress without any garments to cover her private areas. Bianca appeared to only be wearing red knee-high tights with matching high heels.
While going out for dinner in Los Angeles, Bianca held hands with the 46-year-old rapper, as he wore an all-black outfit for the night, according to photos published by TMZ on Monday, April 8.
Over the past few weeks, the couple have been spotted out and about in L.A., and the Yeezy architect has been wearing some of her most unique fashion pieces. Among the most noteworthy this year included miniskirts, sheer lace leggings and low-rise neon leggings.
Ye and Bianca have been married since December 2022, shortly after he finalized his divorce from ex-wife Kim Kardashian. Throughout 2023, breakup rumors circulated, with one report citing Bianca’s family as the prime factor in their separation. However, the “Stronger” rapper and the model shut down the split rumors after they were seen traveling the world together late last year.
Nevertheless, Bianca’s family reportedly continues to worry about her marriage to the Yeezy designer. In March, Daily Mail reported that Bianca’s father, Leo, wanted to have a “sit-down” conversation with Ye to discuss Bianca’s revealing outfits.

“Kanye has been invited to go to Australia, and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react,” an insider told the outlet last month. “Her dad still plans to have a sit-down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye’s power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits.”
The source also claimed that Bianca’s mother, Alexandra, had paid her and Ye a visit after Bianca reportedly told her family she “has this under control” with her husband.
“This has been a wonderful opportunity for Alexandra to get to spend time with Bianca and assess the situation for herself,” the insider continued. “Yes, Bianca dressed provocatively while her mother was there, but it was nothing in comparison to some of the outfits she has worn prior to and since the visit.”",2024-04-09T16:10:45Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife

It’s been eight years since former NBA star Lamar Odom miraculously survived his near-death experience. Much of his recovery process is credited to his athleticism and rapper Kanye West’s music, which gave him hope to reconnect with the world. Both West and Odom were linked as brothers-in-law to the Kardashians through marriage. While the situation is different now after their divorce, Odom has nothing but massive respect for the 24x Grammy Award winner. The former Los Angeles Lakers player recently opened up about West.
The 2x NBA champion praised West’s contribution to the music world and the impact he’s had. “He’s a boss. He’s an owner I look up to. He owns his s**t. He’s a genius as well; probably the biggest artist we had in my generation; Music, clothes, fashion, we got it together, had a beautiful wife, beautiful kids, he’ll be alright,” Odom said in the latest episode of No Jumper.

With his last line, Odom might have hinted toward the backlash West has been facing for his antisemitic remark. Along with criticism from fans and celebrities on social media, the rapper also faced a major setback in his business deals. Many brands, such as Gap, Balenciaga, and more have terminated their deals with him. The termination of his deal with Adidas has even led to his removal from the Forbes Billionaires list.

The 46-year-old boasts of 24 Grammy Awards. As Odom mentioned, he was sensational during the 2000s paving the way for the other artists. West and Kim Kardashian got divorced in 2022. However, back in 2015, when he was still married to Kim, the rapper tried his best to support the NBA legend during his tough time.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians stars, including his ex-wife Khloe Kardashian, were present with him during his recovery process. And one of the most important roles was played by West, who arranged a mini-private concert and sang songs to the legend to help him.

“When I came out the coma, Kanye was playing all his new music for me, trying to get my soul and my spirit all in one with music and I am grateful for that. I have a lot of ideas I wish I could run by him just in life,” Odom said in an interview with Access Hollywood a few years ago.

Bianca Censori Takes Control in Marriage with Kanye West,"Once again, Bianca Censori finds herself in the spotlight, this time for her bold fashion statement during a recent date night with rapper Kanye West. The Australian beauty turned heads with her risqué attire, donning a sheer strapless dress paired with pink tights and heels. Meanwhile, Kanye opted for an all-black ensemble, covering himself from head to toe.
Body language expert Judi James, in an analysis for The Mirror, suggests that Bianca Censori appeared to be taking the lead in their relationship during the outing. She notes, “Bianca’s body language here somehow manages to make it look as though she’s actually taking the lead on this outing while Kanye’s apparent allergy to being visible in public is defined by his total cover-up black baggies and his worried-looking glances at the press.”
James observes their hand-holding, typically a sign of closeness, but highlights subtle cues indicating Bianca’s dominance. She explains, “Kanye’s hand is on top in the clasp which should suggest dominance but the way Bianca’s hand is cupped and scooped upward and the way she is slightly ahead in one of these poses hints she might be the one leading him here.”
The images captured of the couple offer glimpses into their dynamic, sparking speculation about the power balance in their relationship. Despite Kanye’s status as a renowned figure, Bianca’s confident demeanor suggests a different narrative.
As the public continues to dissect their interactions, one thing remains clear: body language can reveal intriguing insights into the dynamics of celebrity relationships.

Just last week she wore another outrageous ensemble as she grabbed dinner in LA with West.
Her date night outfit was a black lacey balconette bra, flesh-coloured lace tights with a floral pattern and chunky cork heels.
She appeared to be going for a nude look—which seems to be coming a regular style for her—and did not seem to be wearing any underwear, exposing her backside and using a purse to cover her front area.
She previously copped severe backlash when she was snapped by paparazzi in France panty-free and could’ve faced a huge fine of more than $16,000 for indecent exposure.

Fans have recently theorized that Censori “knows exactly what she’s doing” by stepping out in shocking outfits alongside her former boss.
For more Page Six Style …
Many people hailed her a “smart lady” when they commented on a resurfaced clip of her delivering a guest lecture for professor Anthony Bonnici’s class at the University of Malta in 2022.
During the lecture, she said, “As designers and architects, we are incessantly chasing the paradigm shift. We talk about it, we design it, we manifest it. But design in its essence will never be encapsulated by a single aesthetic movement. It is pure nature.”

Censori went on, “We believe the paradigm shift lies in humanizing design. The ability to recognize what it is truly to be a human being living in within a built environment. Understanding the needs we have as a collective and designing for that in the most simplistic and functional way.”
Although some speculated that West had potentially manipulated his partner into wearing her revealing looks, an insider told Page Six in March that Censori was actually the mastermind behind her daring wardrobe choices.

“Bianca is extremely intelligent, well-educated, and beyond ambitious,” a source told The National Enquirer.
“This idea that she’s some sort of victim in is way off the mark. She’s absolutely loving the attention she creates by bating her body in public,” the source continued.
“She’s got no problem flaunting her incredible body if that’s what keeps Kanye happy,” claimed the insider. “Putting up with his madness is a means to an end for her. Bianca is getting everything she wants in the way of fashion deals and connections.”
“Kanye has already raised her profile so much she’s now in a position where he needs her as much as she needs him — and she’s going to take it all the way to the bank!”

"Months After Kanye West And Bianca Censori’s Lewd Water Taxi Situation In Italy, Insider Drops Claims About Wild Parties They Threw During That Vacay","Kanye West and Bianca Censori’s relationship has garnered a lot of attention here in the United States, as the two continue to navigate the social scene as a legally married couple. However, they’ve also managed to cause a stir overseas as well. That was truly the case in late 2023 when the two were spotted partaking in a lewd act on a water transport in Italy. It now seems that said situation, which got them banned from the taxi service , wasn’t the most eventful part of their excursion. An insider is now dropping several claims regarding wild parties that the couple threw while they were vacationing in the country.
A source alleges that the pair lived it up in a big way while they were in Italy and even rented out a beautiful home in Tuscany, which reportedly belongs to famed musician Sting. As explained to The U.K. Sun, the two were there “for most of August and September” 2023 and took advantage of the lake, tennis courts and more that were on the grounds. On the whole, the location is made up of six different properties and even includes a recording studio. With that, Mr. and Mrs. Ye apparently enjoyed a number of shindigs, which sound intense:
If people thought Kanye was living it up in Italy after seeing the pictures of him and Bianca in Venice, they don’t know what was going on at Sting’s place. Kanye, Bianca and his entourage and partied hard while they were there. It’s an incredible location and totally off the beaten track, so they could throw all-night parties and make as much noise as they wanted without disturbing anyone. It was quite a scene to have Kanye and his mates take over the house, one of the most picturesque residences in all of Italy.
Even though the gatherings were supposedly boisterous, it sounds like the rapper, his wife and their company didn’t have to worry about disturbing people nearby due to the house’s remote location. These claims will, of course, have to be taken with a grain of salt right now, as no one from the couple’s camp has discussed such parties. However, it’s true that Mr. West has made headlines in the past for holding parties or attending them. The insider went on to say about the supposed festivities:
People who went on the trip have talked about how insane their parties were and they’re hoping he repeats it. It was wild.

As far as we know, there aren’t any photos from these alleged parties, but there were snapshots of the taxi snafu that occurred in Venice this past September. Ye and Bianca Censori were in the taxi, when the former dropped his pants and Censori laid her head on his lap. Following their yacht antics , the service released a statement in which it declared that “we completely dissociate ourselves from such acts and behaviour.” Reps also made it clear that the Grammy winner and his wife will “certainly no longer be welcome on board our company's boats.”
Kanye West and his spouse have already made headlines in a few ways over the first few months of this year. In January, he declared 2024 to be the year of “no pants,” making that declaration in a post that included a photo of his wife. On that note, Bianca Censori has continued to sport unconventional ensembles, and many continue to question how much say she has in her wardrobe. However, sources close to the couple claim she does have a say and that “people are confusing Bianca’s creativity.”
Whether or not the rest of the Wests’ year proves to be as eventful as their vacation in Italy was remains to be seen. Considering how they tend to operate though, the public may indeed continue to keep an eye on them as time goes on.",2024-04-08T15:01:37Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Kanye West’s Chaotic Italian Summer Followed His Covert Rental of Sting’s Opulent Estate,"It has been reported that Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori rented Sting's luxurious 16th-century residence in Tuscany in secrecy during their infamous vacation in Italy last year. Censori and the rapper made headlines multiple times during their vacation in Venice last summer, most notably after they were photographed engaging in obscene behavior on a boat.

As reported by The Sun, sources revealed that the rapper hosted a series of chaotic parties at the opulent estate comprising six properties and featuring private chefs and a cutting-edge recording studio. An insider spilled, ""If people thought Kanye was living it up in Italy after seeing the pictures of him and Bianca in Venice, they don’t know what was going on at Sting’s place. Kanye, Bianca and his entourage and partied hard while they were there. It’s an incredible location and totally off the beaten track, so they could throw all-night parties and make as much noise as they wanted without disturbing anyone.

The source added that West occupied the premises to the fullest for the majority of August and September. The restored bolthole, which Sting and his wife Trudie acquired in 1999, was transformed into their vacation residence. Located in the Chianti region, 45 minutes southeast of Florence, the expansive villa is engaged in the production of honey, wine, and olive oil. It features eight toilets and nine bedrooms, attended by a staff of fifteen. Five enormous cottages, in addition to the main house, can accommodate fifty visitors who have access to all facilities and personnel. As per their website, an abundance of activities can be found on the landscaped grounds, and Sting installed a 10-foot Buddha statue in a chapel at the main residence. The estate also features a life-size chessboard, a gazebo that overlooks a lake, and a fountain that formerly belonged to actress Sophia Loren.

Censori is reportedly beginning to feel used and is having trouble with West 'pressing for more'. An insider told The Daily Mail last month, ""She needs a break and needs to step back. She loved the attention but it is getting overwhelming and Kanye keeps pushing and pushing for more, more, more leading up to the release of Vultures 2."" The source stated that Censori perceives that West is exploiting her for promotional purposes. The source further stated, ""These past couple of months have been an experience, but she really wants to focus on having children after the album drops. She knows she is overexposed."" Concerns arose for Bianca and the couple's somewhat unconventional relationship due to her fashion choices and constant silence. However, insiders later claimed that she had reassured her family that she was not being coerced by her husband.",2024-04-08T11:01:09Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Inside Kanye West’s wild Italian summer after he secretly rented out Sting’s palatial home with 5 villas, chef & studio","AFTER being pictured in a rather compromising position with his wife Bianca Censori on his holiday to Italy last year Kanye West was lucky he didn’t have a run in with the law.
But it turns out the rapper did have a brush with The Police, as I can reveal Kanye rented Sting's luxurious Tuscan home Il Palagiofor his stay.

And insiders revealed the Touch The Sky rapper, who calls himself Ye, held a string of wild parties at the swanky residence, which is made up of six properties and boasts private chefs and a state-of-the-art recording studio.
A source said: “If people thought Kanye was living it up in Italy after seeing the pictures of him and Bianca in Venice, they don’t know what was going on at Sting’s place.
“Kanye, Bianca and his entourage and partied hard while they were there.
“It’s an incredible location and totally off the beaten track, so they could throw all-night parties and make as much noise as they wanted without disturbing anyone. It was quite a scene to have Kanye and his mates take over the house, one of the most picturesque residences in all of Italy.
“Kanye stayed for most of August and September and made full use of the grounds, which includes a lake and tennis courts.
“People who went on the trip have talked about how insane their parties were and they’re hoping he repeats it.
“It was wild.”
Sting and wife Trudie bought the 16th century bolthole in 1999 and after restoration it became their summer home.
As well as the main house, the property has five huge villas so can accommodate 49 guests who can use all the facilities and staff.
I checked out the website to see how much Kanye would have spent on the party pad and it is “price on request”, which means us mere mortals will likely never get a chance to check it out.
Unless we win big on the EuroMillions tomorrow. Fingers crossed.

CAUGHT LIVE: Slash feat Myles Kennedy & The Conspirators @ Wembley Arena EVER the workaholic in his two decades of sobriety, former wild man Slash – wearing a F**k Happens T-shirt – played an intoxicating show of 110 per cent- proof loud rock music. The headliners played a stripped-back visual show with of two hours of nailed on, no-nonsense rock. A deluge of hard riffs ripped through the rammed arena as Slash jumped and swirled around the stage, with his extended solo on Wicked Stone proving his legendary guitar status. Myles’ delicate voice soared and contrasted brilliantly with charismatic bassist Todd “Dammit” Kerns’s powerhouse vocals on Doctor Alibi and covers of Lenny Kravitz’s Always On The Run and Guns N Roses’ Don’t Damn Me.

MOHAWKS are looking pretty cool again thanks to Rihanna.
The singer had her hair styled in curls on top of her head in a nod to the look made famous by The A-Team’s B A Baracus – and she pulled it off with style.
Ri-Ri showed off her new do after a meal with friends at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, California.
While Rihanna always looks flawless, fellow American singer Cardi B has admitted she had an embarrassing moment after hanging out with Ri-Ri and Paris Hilton at a fundraiser in LA last month.
Cardi said: “I’m talking to Paris, I’m talking to Rihanna, sitting right next to each other.
“I went home, you know what I noticed? I noticed I had something black in my teeth the whole time.
“That is so embarrassing.”
It happens to us all Cardi, but shame on Rihanna and Paris for not telling you.
JACK'S FLAK THE biopic on Amy Winehouse has come under fire from keyboard warriors, with its stars Marisa Abela and Jack O’Connell getting a load of flak. But Jack, who plays Amy’s ex Blake Fielder-Civil, is ignoring the hate to focus on what the film is really about – celebrating the singer’s life. Jack said: “I avoid it and shut it off. “If you go looking for it, you’ll find everything you want to read and everything you don’t want to read. As soon as you tap into that you’re asking for trouble.” Jack met Blake to learn more about him though he was initially unsure if he should, given Blake has often been blamed for introducing her to drugs. Jack said: “He wasn’t overly keen, because obviously it’s going into a phase of his life that is very personal and he harbours a mixed bag of emotions. “To understand that relationship, the fame that was a by-product of her success, all the negativity that came with that . . . We’re all fallible. And drugs were f***ing rife then. “Heavy drugs were so heavily done and glamorised. “I spent an afternoon with him, he was quite open. He spoke so highly of Amy. There was something so genuine in how he spoke, it was unquestionable to me that he loved her. That informed how I wanted to portray him.”

He said: “I am buzzing to become a part of the Kiss family and can’t wait to be back on the radio sharing music I love with listeners. “It’s such a brilliant way to connect with people and to do that on a station I’ve always loved, it’s an honour.” I’m sure Marvin will throw in some JLS tunes just for old time’s sake.

“Obviously in the moment I was miserable but now it’s pretty f***ing funny.
“It was super interesting because it was the best time of my life, immediately followed by the worst time of my life.
“So the first half of the album that I was making, I was so happy and life was so good. And then finishing the album was like pulling teeth.”
Despite the heartache from his British ex, Conan added: “I really do love London. I could absolutely see myself moving here.”
Luckily he has good mates around him, including best pal Olivia Rodrigo.
Asked if they had written together, he said: “We’ve written for funsies but never for work.
“With all of my friends we do everything we possibly can to stay as great friends as possible.”
On her global success, he added: “There’s nobody else I know that deserves it more.
“There’s so much music that’s so f***ing s**t, so I’m so glad Olivia gets to fill the radio waves with such great music.”

When Kanye West Accused Beyonce and Jay Z of Using 'Black Magic' for Professional Success,"He, who cannot be silenced is Kanye West. The rapper has an image of being an outspoken artist who seems unfazed by the controversies he keeps stirring. Once, he accused his fellow musicians Beyonce and her husband Jay Z of being ""cultists"" who are into the practice of black magic.

The drama follows where West goes. The Praise God rapper has previously been in the news for his anti-semitic tweets on X, formerly Twitter. Soon after, he was back on the tabloid's front page for his messy divorce with ex-wife and reality star Kim Kardashian, calling it quits after six years and four kids.
Within two months, Ye once again dominated the media for his secret wedding with his former Yeezy architect Bianca Censori in Beverly Hills, California. Prior to his second marriage, the 46-year-old flashed on people's screens for passing insensitive remarks about the late George Floyd and threatening his ex-wife's then-boyfriend Pete Davidson.
Amid all these controversies, Ye has one more in his name and this dates back to November 2022 when he accused Queen Bey and Jay Z of practicing witchcraft to succeed in their professional careers. He called them ""cultists"" and part of the Illuminati group, claiming the power couple even practiced ""human sacrifices"" to earn the fame they have today.
West was once considered a part of Beyonce and Jay Z's inner circle. However, a series of incidents led to a permanent fallout, especially after Ye threatened the 54-year-old of leaving his streaming platform Tidal, claiming the music service owed him $3 million, per Grazia. He also shaded Queen Bey and her spouse from time to time.

In a wild rant, the Runaway singer explained his late mother Donda West and Michael Jordan's father were also ""sacrifices,"" per Marca. However, he declared that they [the powers] could not control him. ""They can't control me,"" Ye claimed. ""They can control Shaq, they can control Charles Barkley, they can control LeBron James, they can control Jay-Z and Beyonce, but they can't control me. Ain't no name I won't name. It's up.""
He further elaborated, ""My momma [Donda West] was sacrificed. Michael Jordan, what about him? His dad, right? Bill Cosby, his son, right? Dr. Dre, his son. Out here in Hollywood, a lot of people come up missing. Feels like it might be a lot of that in order to control, traumatize.""
View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)
""They wanna monetize and traumatize. And God loves me. They hit me. GAP, Adidas, all that away. Still, Forbes, who hate me, had to write, 'Net worth: $400 million,'"" claimed Ye. ""I never killed nobody, right? I'm the pu--y that never killed nobody, right? But that means I could say whatever I want and not go to jail.""
Apparently, Beyonce's former drummer, Kimberly Thompson, also accused her of black magic. She was employed with the Halo singer for nearly seven years and alleged she's into ""extreme witchcraft"" and cast spells on people.",2024-04-07T04:01:03Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Kanye West Allegedly Threatened to 'Shave' and 'Cage’ Donda School Students: Ex-staff in Lawsuit,"A new controversy brought Kanye West into a negative spotlight. The rapper's ex-employee from his unaccredited Christian School, Donda, slapped a lawsuit over serious allegations of threatening to ""cage"" the students. Little is known about the academy located in Chatsworth, California, and has quite a mystery around its inner workings.
Image Source: Getty Images | Photo by Scott Dudelson
Apparently, this isn't the first time Ye's mysterious academy has been sued. Previously, in April 2023, two staff members sued the rapper for the academy's idiosyncratic practices. Also, two students, Cecilia Hailey, and Chekarey Byers, from the K-12 school filed a complaint about the bizarre rules of the academy.
Now, an ex-staffer, Trevor Phillips, who worked for the organization in 2022, filed a suit against the school on Tuesday, April 2, 2024, and accused the Praise God rapper of wanting to ""shave student's heads and cage them."" According to the legal documents obtained by Rolling Stone, the ex-employee claimed West would ""proudly"" express anti-semitic views openly in front of students.
Philips previously worked for the 46-year-old's design company Yeezy before joining the Christian school. During his nine-month in the academy, he heard Ye telling two students he ""wanted to shave their heads"" and ""intended to put [them] in a jail at the school.""
He further alleged in the lawsuit that West was racist and subjected him to ""incessant harassment"" from time to time. Philips in his statement also explained the rapper gave preferential treatment to white employees who pretended to masturbate in front of him and even threatened him with a punch during a ""temper tantrum.""
The former staff added that when he tried to confront Ye for his bigotry, the rapper was ""merciless"" towards him, treating him with humiliation and attempting to ""mentally control and destroy him."" The suit filed by Philips also read, ""Kanye's ill-will towards the plaintiff ultimately culminated in a vulgar lashing in front of schoolchildren and their parents. Kanye even threatened Phillips with physical violence.""
In more shocking claims, Philips also revealed Ye ""boasted"" about his sex life. The lawsuit stated, ""What was meant to be a meeting with his boss about Donda Academy, its curriculum and horticulture, ended up being anti-Semitic and bigoted soliloquy-topped off with sexual harassment.""
The musician also threatened the LGBTQ community and said, ""Yeah I'm going for the gays! FIRST the Jews, THEN the gays,"" accusing Microsft mogul Bill Gates, of controlling ""gay people so that they don't have children for population control.""
i know kanye sucks so bad but dude this is probably the funniest thing i’ve ever read pic.twitter.com/3hmn46ISCE — angel jelly (@angeljellycore) April 3, 2024
In previous lawsuits, the students and staff members shared the strange rules of Donda Academy, for instance, the dress code was strictly all-black from ""head to toe,"" brands like Adidas and Nike were banned from the school, the utensils in the school's kitchen were in gray, students were prohibited from using wither forks or other utensils when they ate, and they were served ""only sushi"" every single day.

Referring to a recently filed lawsuit by former Ye employee Trevor Phillips — who accused the musician of anti-Black racism, homophobic and antisemitic outbursts in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday — Che noted, “In a lawsuit against Ye, a former employee claims that Ye compared himself to Hitler, minus the gas chambers.”
Che then quipped, “I, for one, am shocked to hear that Ye believes in the Holocaust.” (Ye has served as musical guest on “Saturday Night Live,” and once launched into a pro-Trump rant off-air while wearing a MAGA hat.)
Moving on to another embroiled hip-hop star, Colin Jost noted an embarassing moment in a “Live with Kelly & Mark” repeat that aired this past week referencing Diddy — taped long before the current investigation over the mogul’s alleged wrongdoings.
“This week, ‘Live with Kelly & Mark’ re-ran an episode from 2023 in which host Kelly Ripa begged to go on Diddy’s yacht,” Jost said, alluding to how that desire hadn’t aged well. Sean “Diddy” Combs is currently being investigated for alleged sexual misconduct and was recently named in a sexual assault lawsuit against his son, Christian Combs. Christian has been accused of sexual misconduct on a yacht that Diddy chartered.
Jost then poked fun at his co-anchor. “Even crazier, ‘SNL’ is airing an episode right now with a guy who was on Diddy’s yacht last week!” A picture of Michael Che photoshopped onto a yacht with a glass of champagne in hand appeared on the screen. The camera then showed Che shaking his head “no” with a smirk.
Kristen Wiig hosted the April 6 episode, with musical guest Raye performing. It was the former SNL cast member’s fifth time as a host, and she joined the “Five-Timer’s Club.” Other “Five-Timer’s Club” members appeared in the episode, including Paul Rudd, Jon Hamm, and Martin Short.",2024-04-07T02:23:00Z,https://variety.com,Variety
Bianca Censori Plans to Have Kids With Kanye West and to Continue Wearing Racy Outfits,"Kanye West and Bianca Censori who have stirred numerous controversies with their fashion and lifestyle choices since tying the knot in 2022, plan to begin a family soon. An insider revealed to The US Sun, “Bianca is in her element. She loves the attention and being dressed by Ye, despite what everyone thinks of her outfits. She feels a lot of her looks are artistic, not just about fashion. Bianca is fully dedicated and in it for the long haul, she doesn’t care what people think of her. I wouldn’t be surprised if she got pregnant soon and she'll still wear revealing outfits the same as Rihanna did.""

The insider further shared that the couple is ""always laughing and joking"" despite appearing emotionless in photographs scrutinized by fans. ""She feels like royalty with Kanye...She is happy to support everything he does and be there at all times, even if he’s intense."" In the lyrics of his Vultures album featuring Ty Dollar $ign, West stated that he desires more kids with his second wife.
In the hit track Keys To My Life, he raps, ""You already know my M.O.​ / Is you ready for the Venmo? You already know my demo / You already know I'm impulsive / And another baby is my end goal."" The rapper's close pal, Justin Laboy, also told a TMZ photographer last month at LAX Airport, that the couple may be planning kids. ""I think they are going to have a bunch of babies...I love her. She's great. She lives an amazing life,"" he added. “I've been around Ye for years now, and she’s extremely happy.""

Echoing Laboy's claims, a source recently disclosed to The Daily Mail, that Censori wants kids with West and has already “discussed baby plans with her family,"" despite those close to her thinking it's an extremely bad idea. They added, ""He is her husband so of course she has talked about this, and being a stepmom to Kanye's kids has really only made her desire to have kids stronger."" The former model has frequently been spotted with West's children on family outings and seems to get along well with them. West shares four children with his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian— North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4.

""There was a time when her parents were supportive of her having children with Kanye, but no one believes at this time that her becoming pregnant and having a baby right now is a good idea,"" the source added. ""They want Bianca to have children and they want grandchildren, but they want them to grow up in a stable and loving household.

Iubita lui Kanie West îi cheltuie și ultimii bani,"Monden Iubita lui Kanye West aruncă și ultimii bani ai cântărețului pe haine. Finanțele artistului testate de nevoia de shopping a iubitei
În ciuda preocupărilor financiare, Kanye poate să-și permită look-ul scump al iubitei sale. Asta deși artistul a recunoscut că aproape a intrat în faliment pe fondul provocărilor sale financiare. Totuși a asimțit o revenire financiară după reclama de succes cu buget redus pentru Super Bowl. Acum, au apărut alte dovezi care sugerează că rapperul nu este îngrijorat de bani. Soția sa, Bianca Censori, a cheltuit o mică avere pe ținutele ei.
Potrivit jurnaliștilor The Sun, ținutele recente ale Biancăi par să coste mai mult de 7.000 de dolari. Această etichetă de preț mare poate fi șocantă, având în vedere că în fapt aceste haine nu acopeeră mai nimic. Practic pare că nu prea există.
Ultimii bani ai lu Kanye dați pe haine inexistente
Unele dintre înfățișările ei recente includ costume de tip catsuit confecționate din chiloți. Așa că materialul pur și limitat îi face pe unii fani să se întrebe cum poate costa atât de mult o ținută. „Bianca a făcut alegeri ciudate care nu sunt deosebit de măgulitoare, cool sau sofisticate”, a spus stilista Amanda Sanders pentru The Sun.
„Kanye are bani, așa că ar putea fi expresivă în ceea ce poartă și să aibă o gamă largă de alegeri. Indiferent de mesajul pe care a încercat să-l iasă”, a continuat ea. În timp ce unele surse susțin că Kanye controlează comportamentul și alegerile vestimentare ale Biancăi, alte speculații sun că e o mișcare de PR.
Mișcare de PR sau alegerile Biancăi?
Ceea ce nu poate fi pus la îndoială este că aspectul scump al Biancăi a stârnit controverse. Anul trecut, rapoartele sugerau că ea s-ar putea confrunta cu o amendă sau chiar cu închisoare pentru indecență publică, după ce lookul nud al Biancai a stârnit reacții în Italia. În urma unei serii de comportament controversate, inclusiv comentarii antisemite, Kanye s-a confruntat cu un val de procese costisitoare. El a pierdut, de asemenea, diverse tranzacții care i-au înjumătățit averea.",2024-04-06T17:55:09Z,https://evz.ro,EVENIMENTUL ZILEI
Kanye West Once Alleged That Kim Kardashian Had Accused Him of “Putting a Hit Out on Her”,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West got hitched in 2014 and were happily married until March 2022. Following their separation, West shocked the public with an embarrassing tirade, when he disclosed that Kardashian once accused him of ""putting a hit out on her"".
In a now-deleted Instagram post, the rapper shared a screenshot of a text message requesting Kardashian's phone number, writing in all caps: ""Yesterday Kim accused me of putting a hit out on her. So let me get this straight I beg to go to my daughter's party and I'm accused of being on drugs then I go play with my son and I take my Akira graphic novels and I'm accused of stealing. Now I'm being accused of putting a hit on her. These ideas can actually get someone locked up they play like that with black men's lives whether it's getting them free or getting them locked up."" West concluded, ""I'm Not Playing About My Black Children Anymore.""

As per The US Sun, fans rushed to a popular Reddit forum to express their opinions. One fan wrote, ""This is just so sad, and I honestly feel bad for the kids. This is something they’re going to see one day."" A second fan added, ""This is such a mess and really needs to be taken off social media.""
Chiming in, a third fan added, ""This is messier than glitter."" The public feud unfolded over the SKIMS founder allowing their eight-year-old daughter, North West, to post videos on TikTok despite West disapproving of it. He wrote, ""Since this is my first divorce I need to know what I should do about my daughter being put on TikTok against my will?""

The Hulu star posted a statement in response that read, ""Kanye's constant attacks on me in interviews and on social media is actually more hurtful than any TikTok North might create. As the parent who is the main provider and caregiver for our children, I am doing my best to protect our daughter while also allowing her to express her creativity in the medium that she wishes with adult supervision because it brings her so much happiness. Divorce is difficult enough on our children and Kanye's obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negatively and publicly is only causing further pain for all.""
Kanye West rants again about Kim Kardashian putting North West on TikTok:

Kardashian added that from the beginning, she wanted a healthy and supportive co-parenting relationship with West for the sake of their children and was upset that the rapper continued ""to make it impossible every step of the way."" She explained, ""I wish to handle all matters regarding our children privately and hopefully he can finally respond to the third attorney he has had in the last year to resolve any issues amicably.""

In response, West retorted, ""What do you mean by main provider? America saw you try to kidnap my daughter on her birthday by not providing the address. You put security on me inside of the house to play with my son then accused me of stealing. I had to take a drug test after Chicago’s party cause you accused me of being on drugs. Tracy Romulus stop manipulating Kim to be this way…""

Subsequently, West accused the reality star of bad parenting. According to BuzzFeed, he wrote, ""This is an example of Kim's cousin agreeing with me about TikTok and then proceeding to ask me for some Yeezys afterward. Her other cousin Kara called me saying she agreed with me then said she would speak out publicly which she never did...Then, she suggested I take medication. My dad didn't have money or a public voice when my mom destroyed me and his relationship. I do this for every parent on either side whose kid's futures are being one-sidedly controlled...I don't even have the right to get angry as a father without being called erratic. I gave that family the culture if they as a whole unit keep playing games with me I will take that culture back. A father should never have to beg for the location of their children.""",2024-04-06T12:29:25Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Kanye West's Ex Julia Fox Reveals Shocking Reason for Stealing McDonald's Donation Box,"Julia Fox and Kanye West first met in Miami in 2022 and broke up just one month later. “I only could do it for so long because ultimately I think he needed a full-time person and I just couldn't be full-time,” Fox said then. While briefly dating the Bound 2 rapper the Uncut Gems actress appeared on an episode of the Forbidden Fruits podcast, titled 'Behind the Scenes with Julia Fox.' During the discussion about her early life, Fox admitted that she came from an unstable family and once stole from a donation box. ""For instance, when I was 15, my best friend and I stole a Ronald McDonald Foundation donation box from the f***ing counter in a McDonald’s on 23rd street."" She continued, ""But if that’s the only thing you knew about me, you’d be like, ‘She’s a horrible person! She stole from orphans.'""
Julia Fox has hit back at claims she is dating Kanye West for fame and money:
“Honey, I've dated billionaires my entire adult life, let's keep it real. Watch my movie, read my book. That is more thrilling to me now than eyes on me. I couldn't care less.” pic.twitter.com/5R61x0SPAX — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) January 23, 2022
As per The US Sun, Fox justified her action saying her behavior could be explained by the fact that she was hungry, came from an unstable household, and ""probably wanted to get high."" In a 2020 interview with Coveteur, Fox revealed that she had indulged in various side hustles to make ends meet. “I didn’t grow up with money, so I was always trying to make money any way I could. I remember as a teenager, I would sell my panties and stuff. There was this man in Union Square who would buy [them].” She simply recalled that ""everyone knew him"" and that they would go to him to sell off their undergarments, even though she couldn't quite remember how she located this stranger to sell her personal belongings to.
She mentioned that there was another guy who would purchase socks from individuals, but since he seemed to ""only [buy] from guys,"" she was unable to sell to him directly. Rather, Fox discovered a way to circumvent the buyer's rule.

“I would go with my guy friends, and then they would give me the money,” she said. “If you need something, you’ll find it, you know what I mean? I took any job that I could get.” She would also discover ways to obtain medications at a discount and resell them to wealthy children for a profit. Afterward, West's girlfriend managed to secure a few months of employment as a dominatrix.
As per BBC, Fox detailed her one-month romance with West in her memoir Down the Drains, ""I think at the time there were definitely some red flags that I chose to turn a blind eye to because it was fun and exciting, and shiny, and you know just new,"" she told BBC Host Emma Barnett last year. ""It felt like a relief in the beginning 'Oh finally someone else can take the reins', but I think you know it became unsustainable and that's why the relationship only lasted a month.""",2024-04-06T11:42:23Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Bianca Censori: Τρομαγμένη σε νέα ""γυμνή"" έξοδο με τον Kanye West","Αν και ήταν άλλη μία… συνηθισμένη εμφάνισή της, αυτή τη φορά, η συνήθως ψυχρή και απόμακρη Bianca έμοιαζε φοβισμένη
Με έντρομο βλέμμα και ύφος σαν να ζητάει βοήθεια εμφανίστηκε αυτή τη φορά δημοσίως η Bianca Censori – η σύντροφος του Kanye West – σε άλλη μία «γυμνή» έξοδό της.
Η νεαρή Αυστραλιανή αρχιτέκτονας βγήκε για φαγητό με τον διάσημο ράπερ και επιχειρηματία «σύζυγό» της φορώντας μόνο ένα σουτιέν και άσπρο δαντελωτό καλσόν, χωρίς εσώρουχο, προσπαθώντας να καλύψει τα απόκρυφα σημεία της με μία τσάντα.
Αν και ήταν άλλη μία… συνηθισμένη εμφάνισή της, αυτή τη φορά, η συνήθως ψυχρή και απόμακρη Bianca έμοιαζε φοβισμένη.
Περπατούσε δίπλα στον West φοβισμένη και μαζεμένη ενώ κοιτούσε τον φωτογραφικό φακό με ορθάνοιχτα μάτια και τρομαγμένο ύφος, προκαλώντας πληθώρα ερωτηματικών.
Πολλοί χρήστες στα social media παρατήρησαν το γεγονός ότι φαίνεται χαμένη, ταραγμένη και φοβισμένη, ενώ κάποιοι είπαν ότι φαίνεται πως αναγκάζεται να φερθεί έτσι δημοσίως.

Bianca Censori Covers Modesty with Purse on Dinner with Kanye in LA,"Bianca Censori has baffled the netizens yet again with her choice of ensemble while on an outing with her husband, Kanye West. This time, the architect, shocked onlookers with sheer stockings as she hid her modesty with a black laced purse.

Censori paired a revealing black bra with flesh-colored lace tights, opting not to wear underwear as she covered herself with her purse while walking to the restaurant. Earlier, she had received criticism for not wearing underwear publicly in France, risking potential legal consequences such as a substantial fine or imprisonment for indecent exposure. However, it was later disclosed that the brunette employed a well-known Hollywood special effects technique to achieve the nude illusion appearance.

Rumors have it that Censori allegedly fears she's being used as a 'marketing tool' by West. The Aussie stunner sported glowy makeup and her brunette hair was styled in a bun. Meanwhile, West strolled closely beside his scantily-clad spouse in a baggy all-black outfit. The Flashing Lights hitmaker kept the hood of his sweatshirt up over his head and, despite it being nighttime, had sunglasses on.
Bianca Censori seemed to be channeling an old episode of ""Seinfeld"" -- in which one of the characters wore nothing but a bra and caused heads to turn.

As an apparent dig at Adidas — who severed ties with the rapper in 2022 over his anti-Semitic tirades — West wore black Nike sneakers. The couple tied the knot in December 2022 just weeks after finalizing his divorce from Kim Kardashian, 43, with whom he shares four children. The rapper has paraded his current wife around the world in racy getups — including going nude beneath a see-through raincoat in LA and stepping out sans pants in foreign countries — and concern has been mounting over whether or not she is being controlled by the controversial rapper.

According to an insider who recently spoke to DailyMail.com, Censori is becoming increasingly aware of being ""overexposed"" and is growing weary of being utilized as a ""free marketing tool"" for West's forthcoming album, Vultures 2. According to the insider, she is feeling the urge to step back and take a break, despite previously enjoying the attention she received. They noted that the mounting pressure from West to ramp up publicity ahead of the release of Vultures 2 has become burdensome. Reportedly, Censori now wants to shift her focus away from her provocative displays and instead concentrate on starting a family with West after his album is released.
The couple's recent outing in LA coincides with a legal dispute involving the rapper and an ex-employee from his now-closed Donda Academy. Former Yeezy team member Trevor Phillips, who transitioned to the Donda Academy in California, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles. According to legal documents obtained by Rolling Stone, Phillips alleges disturbing behavior from West, including threats to shave students' heads and confine them to cages. Phillips, who worked with West for nine months starting in November 2022, asserts that West made alarming statements to students and exhibited preferential treatment toward white employees.",2024-04-06T06:57:15Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Γιατί πάλι ο Kanye West στο Νο1,"Ψυχοπαθής ή όχι ο Kanye West, ή αλλιώς Ye, επιστρέφει στο Νο1 του Billboard και όλοι αναρωτιούνται τι συμβαίνει με αυτόν τον τύπο;
Κάποιος να τον σταματήσει! Αντιπαθητικός, εκνευριστικός, υπερόπτης και απρόβλεπτος. Κάποιοι γελούν με τις απόψεις και τις εκκεντρικές εμφανίσεις του και άλλοι τον αποκαλούν “ψυχάκια” και νευρωτικό. Το “αυτί” του πρώην δισεκατομμυριούχου Κάνιε Γουεστ (Kanye West), ή αλλιώς Ye όπως του αρέσει να τον φωνάζουν, δεν ιδρώνει ούτε στο ελάχιστο με τους haters και ξανά προς τη δόξα τραβά, τραβά, τραβά.
Ο πρώην σύζυγος της Κιμ Καρντάσιαν το τελευταίο διάστημα ξοδεύει τον χρόνο του κυρίως για να σκαρφιστεί νέους τρόπους να προσεγγίσει τα κοινά που τον ενδιαφέρουν. Ή πιθανώς να ψηλαφίσει κοινά που τώρα δημιουργούνται και δεν επηρεάζονται από τα “παραδοσιακά” media.
Το νέο του άλμπουμ, “Vultures 1” κυριαρχεί στην περίβλεπτη λίστα του Billboard 200, γεγονός που μας κάνει να αναρωτιόμαστε πώς γίνεται όλοι να τον λοιδoρούν και ταυτόχρονα τόσοι πολλοί να τον “αγοράζουν”. Το υπερτροφικό του “εγώ”, η ρευστή ψυχική του κατάσταση και η σύζυγός του Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι την οποία θέλει να περιφέρει δημοσίως και ολόγυμνη αν γίνεται, είναι μόνο μερικές σταγόνες στον ωκεανό της εκκεντρικής φύσης του Ye.

Γιατροί δεν είμαστε, ωστόσο μετά το μπλουζάκι “White Lives Matter” και τα άθλια αντισημιτικά σχόλια (για τα οποία έχει από τότε δημοσιεύσει μια δημόσια συγγνώμη στα εβραϊκά), ο Kanye θα έπρεπε να έχει καταποντιστεί. Think again!
Ο YE ΣΤΗΝ ΚΟΡΥΦΗ ΜΕ ΤΟ “CARNIVAL”
Από το “Vultures 1” ξεχωρίζει το “Carnival” με το οποίο την περασμένη εβδομάδα, ο Ye πέτυχε το πρώτο του Νο. 1 στην λίστα των 100 κορυφαίων τραγουδιών του Billboard, επτά χρόνια μετά το “Stronger” του 2007. Χτύπησε πρωτιά όχι κάνοντας ένα ιδιαίτερα καλό τραγούδι, αλλά “ακούγοντας τα παιδιά” (όπως ο ίδιος φώναξε με νόημα στον κόσμο σε συναυλία του το 2020). Αυτό που εννοούσε ίσως είναι ότι ψυχανεμίζεται όσα ακούει η πολύ νεότερη γενιά και ανταποκρίνεται σε αυτά;
Kanye West στο FYF Fest το 2015 στο LA Rich Fury/Invision/AP
Ο West και ο Ty Dolla $ign πέρασαν μεγάλο μέρος του 2023 κάνοντας το Vultures. Οι διαδικασία δημιουργίας του άλμπουμ κράτησε σε μεγάλο βαθμό τον Ye μακριά από τη δημοσιότητα. Μετά το “White lives matter” και τα αντισημιτικά σχόλια, ο YE επαίνεσε τους Ναζί και τον Χίτλερ σε μια συνέντευξη με τον Alex Jones και συγχρωτίστηκε με αμφιλεγόμενα πρόσωπα της ακροδεξιάς, όπως ο Nick Fuentes και ο Milo Yiannopoulos.
Όλα αυτά κόστισαν στον Ye μερικές από τις πιο σημαντικές και προσοδοφόρες συνεργασίες του με εταιρείες κολοσσούς, όπως οι Adidas, Balenciaga, GAP και το πρακτορείο ταλέντων CAA. Προφανώς όμως δεν ήταν αρκετά άσχημα για να απομονώσουν τον Ye καλλιτεχνικά.
Πριν από την επίσημη κυκλοφορία του Vultures, ο West και ο Ty Dolla $ign διοργάνωσαν έναν γύρο από listening parties σε αρένες στο Σικάγο και τη Νέα Υόρκη. Κατά τη διάρκεια ενός από αυτά τα prelistening events ο Ozzy Osbourne έμαθε ότι ο Ye είχε προφανώς αγνοήσει τις επιθυμίες του και είχε βάλει ένα κομμάτι από μια ζωντανή εκτέλεση του “Iron Man” από το 1983 στο τραγούδι “Carnival”. Χωρίς την άδειά του.
“Δεν θέλω καμία σχέση με αυτόν τον άνθρωπο!” είπε ο Ozzy αναγκάζοντας το δίδυμο West και Ty Dolla $ign να αντικαταστήσει το μουσικό σημείο από ένα ασαφές synth bass riff που δεν ήταν Black Sabbath, αλλά θύμιζε αρκετά.

Ακολουθώντας τα βήματα του Osbourne, οι κληρονόμοι της Donna Summer κατηγόρησαν τον Ye ότι χρησιμοποίησε το “I Feel Love” χωρίς άδεια στο “Good (Don’t Die)”. Το τραγούδι του West περιλαμβάνει τον στίχο “Oh, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive, I’m alive, oh” με μελωδία και ρυθμό που φαινόταν παρόμοιος με το “I Feel Love”. Αλλά ούτε και αυτά κατάφεραν να φρενάρουν τον Ye.
Εξάλλου σημαντικό μέρος του hype που τον συνοδεύει – λένε κάποιοι – έχει να κάνει με την ναρκισσιστική του προσωπικότητα και όχι με το ταλέντο του στη μουσική. Περίπου έναν χρόνο μετά το αντισημιτικό του παραλήρημα που του κόστισε μεγάλες εμπορικές συμφωνίες με οίκους μεγαθήρια, ο Ye βρίσκει ακόμα έμπνευση σε νεοναζιστικά σύμβολα … και δεν διστάζει να φωτογραφηθεί με μπλουζάκι της νεοναζιστικής νορβηγικής μπάντας Burzum με frontman τον Varg Vikernes, καταδικασμένο κακοποιό. Ο Vikernes αποκαλεί την ιδεολογία του “Odalism” και υποστηρίζει τη δημιουργία μιας «προβιομηχανικής ευρωπαϊκής παγανιστικής κοινωνίας» και αντιτίθεται στο Ισλάμ, τον Χριστιανισμό, τον Ιουδαϊσμό, τον καπιταλισμό, τον σοσιαλισμό και τον υλισμό. Και ο Ye είναι ακόμα Ye!
Το “Carnival” με τον Ty Dolla $ign (μαζί ¥$) αρέσει πάρα πολύ (6,5 μύρια μόνο στο YouTube). Λίγοι καλλιτέχνες θα σκέφτονταν αυτή την απίστευτα δημιουργική ιδέα (λέμε τώρα!) να μετατρέψουν μια άκομψη ηχογράφηση Ιταλών οπαδών ποδοσφαίρου σε “ραχοκοκαλιά” ενός κομματιού που σαρώνει στα κλαμπ. Για το στιχουργικό κομμάτι τι να πει κανείς και τι να σχολιάσει! Οι φανς του Playboi Carti, θεωρούν ότι το “Carnival” είναι το καλύτερο τραγούδι του (για φαντάσου).
Σε ένα μουσικό επίπεδο ο Ye και ο Carti τα πάνε περίφημα, από τότε που συνεργάστηκαν το 2020, στο άλμπουμ “Whole Lotta Red”. Εκτός από τη σόλο καριέρα του, ο Carter ίδρυσε το 2019 τη δισκογραφική εταιρεία και το δημιουργικό πρακτορείο Opium, μέσω του οποίου έχει υπογράψει τους Ken Carson και Destroy Lonely από τη Τζόρτζια, καθώς και το συγκρότημα Homixide Gang. Μουσικά το σήμα κατατεθέν της εταιρίας είναι σκοτεινή, σκληρή παραγωγή και τα αβανταδόρικα synths, που θυμίζουν την εποχή του punk rock των δεκαετιών 1970 και 80. Τόσο ο Carter όσο και η εταιρεία του έχουν αποκτήσει τη λατρεία οπαδών δημιουργώντας μια καλτ μικροκοινότητα.

ΓΙΑΤΙ Ο CARTI ΕΙΝΑΙ Ο YΕ ΤΗΣ GEN Z;
Και ένα άλλο πράγμα που ο Ye θαυμάζει και αναγνωρίζει στον Carti είναι ότι δεν φθείρεται στα media. Η δισκογραφία του Playboi Carti – οι επιτυχίες του στα charts, τα τραγούδια του που (τάχα) διαρρέουν, η παρέλαση όσων τον μιμούνται – κρυφά και φανερά – σκιαγραφούν μία εικόνα κατασκευασμένης “έλλειψης” σε μια εποχή απόλυτης έκθεσης και υπερβολής. Συγκριτικά με όσους φωτογραφίζονται συνεχώς, ο Carti φαίνεται να αρκείται στο να κρύβεται γύρω από τα φώτα της δημοσιότητας.
Ο Ye καταλαβαίνει ότι η συνεργασία με τον ράπερ από την Ατλάντα ανοίγει πόρτες στο τεράστιο νεανικό κοινό της Gen Z που είναι πρόθυμο να κοιτάξει πέρα από τη σωρεία των μισητών σχολίων του, όπως ακριβώς έκαναν και με τους ισχυρισμούς του ίδιου του Carti ότι πήγε να πνίξει την έγκυο σύντροφό του! Πταίσματα σου λέει ο μέσος απολιτίκ (ή κάτι χειρότερο) έφηβος λάτρης αυτής της μουσικής …
Ο Carti έχει σχεδόν γίνει ένας Ye για τη Gen Z. Σε πάρτι για την ακρόαση του δίσκου του Ye στη Νέα Υόρκη ρεπορτάζ λένε ότι το κοινό ήταν όχι πάνω από 15 ετών(!!). Πολλοί τον ανακάλυψαν μέσα από το Tik Tok (βοήθειά μας).
Ο Ye παραδίδει τον εαυτό του σε μία νέα γενιά … πουλώντας τα πάντα στην ιστοσελίδα του για 20 δολάρια ώστε να μπορούν να τα αγοράσουν με το… χαρτζιλίκι τους; Επικοινωνεί με τους φανς απευθείας στο διαδίκτυο. Για παράδειγμα είχε συνομιλίες σε έναν δημοφιλή λογαριασμό θαυμαστών του Ye μέσω DMs σχετικά με μια ιδέα να πουλήσει το “Vultures 2” αποκλειστικά στην ιστοσελίδα του.
Ye: Was talking with the team about how to release the next album Like James Blake said streaming devalues our music
We sell albums on https://t.co/KZ5lBI5zfM I got 20 million instagram followers
When 5% of my followers buy an album. That's 1 million albums sold

Στο “Vultures 2” θέλει πάλι να συνεργαστεί με τον Carti, ενώ σε ένα post του στα social είπε αστειευόμενος ότι θα έβγαζε μια υπερ-διαρροή σε ένα επερχόμενο άλμπουμ αν εξασφάλιζε ότι οι φανς του θα αγόραζαν για 200 δολάρια την ανάρτηση. Κι αν εμείς δεν θα δίναμε ούτε 5 ευρώ για να ακούσουμε πρώτοι ένα άλμπουμ του Ye, είμαστε η απόλυτη εξαίρεση σε ένα σύμπαν γεμάτο μικρούληδες Ye που τον ακολουθούν.
Κάποιοι μεταξύ αστείου και σοβαρού αναρωτιούνται μήπως ο Ye έχει βάλει στο μάτι και το χαρτζιλίκι των παιδιών της Gen Alpha, που είναι τα παιδιά των Μιλένιαλ και των μεγαλύτερων της Gen Z και είναι ένα κοινό που τώρα διαμορφώνεται;
Προς το παρόν, ο 46χρονος Kanye πέτυχε για άλλη μια φορά το αξιοσημείωτο κατόρθωμα να εξασφαλίσει ότι – ό,τι και να γίνει – κάποιος εκεί έξω θα ενδιαφερθεί για τη μουσική του.

Provoziert Kanye West mit Biancas Outfits seine Ex-Frau Kim?,"Kanye West (46) und Kim Kardashian (43) sind seit November 2022 offiziell geschieden. Doch die Sache zwischen ihnen scheint immer noch nicht ganz abgeschlossen zu sein. Eine Expertin für Körpersprache vermutet nun, dass der Rapper versuche, seine Ex-Frau mit den gewagten Outfits seiner Neuen zu provozieren. Judi James glaubt, dass er ""eine Version von [Kim] gefunden hat, die ihn vergöttert, die genauso schön ist und die sich gerne so kleidet und verhält, wie er es will."" Damit soll er der Skims-Gründerin zeigen wollen, dass er in seiner Beziehung mit Bianca Censori (29) glücklicher ist als mit ihr.
Die Expertin schätzt, dass die schockierenden Looks eine Art Mutprobe für die Ehefrau des ""Famous""-Interpreten darstellen. Die Architektin fiel in letzter Zeit häufiger mit ihrer Kleidung auf. Wie Mail Online berichtete, trug sie bei einem Shopping-Ausflug in Paris eine Strumpfhose und eine Felljacke. Die Unterwäsche schien Bianca allerdings in Los Angeles vergessen zu haben, denn sie präsentierte sich den Paparazzi untenrum nackt. Die französischen Behörden könnten ihr deshalb sogar noch eine gehörige Strafe wegen Exhibitionismus aufdrücken. Ob sie die 15.000 Euro schon zahlen musste, ist bisher nicht bekannt.
Die freizügigen Outfits der 29-Jährigen sorgen nicht nur für Ärger mit dem Gesetz. Auch Biancas Vater soll wenig begeistert von den öffentlichen Auftritten seiner Tochter sein. Ein Insider packte gegenüber Daily Mail aus: ""Ihr Vater hat vor, ein ernstes Wort mit Kanye zu reden. Leo wird sich nicht von Kanyes Erfolg einschüchtern lassen und ihm die Stirn bieten."" Die Eltern hatten schon versucht, mit der Yeezy-Architektin persönlich zu sprechen – allerdings ohne Erfolg. Der Familienvater könnte ein ganz schön einschüchternder Gesprächspartner sein: In den 1980ern hatte er wegen Heroinbesitzes fünf Jahre in Haft verbracht.

Kanye West finds 'compliant' version of Kim Kardashian in Bianca Censori,"Kanye West finds 'compliant' version of Kim Kardashian in Bianca Censori
Kanye West is seemingly sending messages to his ex-wife Kim Kardashian that he found her 'compliant' version in Bianca Censori.
In conversation with The Mirror, body language expert Judi James claimed that the rapper dressed his wife in racy outfits to show off Kim that the Australian beauty 'obeys' her husband.
The expert shared that the Yeezy founder wants to prove that he ""found a version of her [Kim] who is besotted with him, who is as beautiful and who will happily and compliantly dress and behave in a way that he wants and look happy doing so.""
Judi added, ""Bianca looks almost like Kanye’s statement of ‘See! I told you it could work!’ which is a common theme with second marriages.""
""When you find a man impossible to live with many, men will re-marry a woman who looks similar but who is younger and who seems able or even grateful to fill the gap left by the first wife,"" the expert said.
For the unversed, Kim was married to Kanye for ten years. However, the two parted ways in 2021.
The former couple co-parents their four kids, North, 10, Saint, 7, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4.
Soon after their high-profile divorce, Kanye reportedly tied the knot with the Bianca in 2022.",2024-04-05T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Kanye West’s Wife Bianca Censori Wears See-Through Nude Pants,"Kanye “Ye” West and his wife, Bianca Censori, have been out on the town, and she has been dressed to impress. During their most recent outing together, the 29-year-old architect was seen wearing a long-sleeved, beige-colored romper with small matching high heels.
Per a social media video circulating via X on Friday, April 5, Bianca and Ye, 46, were laughing and smiling as they walked through a local shopping center in Los Angeles. Bystanders in the video took the moment to record the A-list couple as they strolled together. However, the fashion from their latest day out didn’t compare to one from earlier this week.

Two days prior, Bianca was reportedly spotted wearing see-through, nude-colored, lace leggings with matching pump heels and a black bra. Bianca covered her apparently exposed midsection with a black clutch. She and Ye were photographed walking into Gigi’s in Los Angeles on Wednesday, April 3, according to photos published by Daily Mail. For his part, Ye wore an all-black outfit — a hoodie and baggy pants with matching sneakers and sunglasses.
Last month, the same outlet reported that Bianca’s father, Leo, wanted to have a “sit-down” with Ye to discuss the provocative outfits he’s seen his daughter wearing since she married the “Jesus Walks” rapper in 2022. From sheer pants to revealing mini dresses, the Australia native has made headlines for her style choices.
“Kanye has been invited to go to Australia, and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react,” an insider told the publication in March. “Her dad still plans to have a sit-down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye’s power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits.”
The source also pointed out that Bianca’s mother, Alexandra, flew out to the U.S. to “see for herself” what kind of relationship the Yeezy employee has with Ye. In the end, the insider claimed that Alexandra witnessed Ye’s “intimidating” demeanor.
“Yes, Bianca dressed provocatively while her mother was there, but it was nothing in comparison to some of the outfits she has worn prior to and since the visit,” the source concluded, noting that Bianca was “hesitant” to deal with her father’s alleged frustration over the situation.”

Kanye West esce con Bianca Censori vestita solo con il reggiseno,"La ventinovenne continua ad apparire in pubblico seminuda a seguito del rapper. Questa volta il look è composto da un reggiseno e un paio di collant ricamati indossato senza slip, un outfit che rivela l'ossessione di West per la biancheria intima
Se Bianca Censori è riuscita ad uscire di casa seminuda in pieno inverno sfidando anche le rigide temperature di Parigi nei giorni della Fashion Week, cosa riuscirà a fare ora che la bella stagione è alle porte?
Chi pensava che la moglie di Kanye West non potesse osare di più dopo il look trasparenti che non lasciavano nulla all'immaginazione dell'ultima stagione, si sbagliava. La ventinovenne il cui guardaroba recente sembra composto quasi esclusivamente da biancheria intima è riuscita a fare a meno anche di quella, o quasi. Nella sua ultima uscita a Los Angeles, infatti, Censori ha indossato un reggiseno ma sotto alle calze ricamate color carne non c'erano gli slip.
Censori modella e musa di West
A nulla valgono gli appelli espressi dalla famiglia di Bianca Censori sulla stampa, mezzo che i parenti della donna utilizzano da mesi per manifestare pubblicamente le proprie preoccupazioni. La ventinovenne moglie di Kanye West non ascolta nessuno e continua a dare scandalo in pubblico coi suoi look esaudendo i desideri del rapper che la starebbe utilizzando come musa e modella di un non meglio specificato business fashion a cui lavora da tempo.
Questa la motivazione che si sente da un po' a proposito dei look della attuale signora West la quale sarebbe una pedina della guerra tra il rapper e la sua ex moglie Kim Kardashian, incona della moda inseguita dagli stilisti di mezzo mondo.
West vorrebbe fondare un nuovo brand il cui focus sarebbe l'intimo, core business di SKIMS, il fiore all'occhiello del portafoglio di marchi di Kardashian, per questo è l'intimo il punto di forza dei look di Censori che indossa quasi sempre solo collant che mettono in bella vista il suo corpo nudo.
In attesa di capire la direzione di West, cantautore, produttore, musicista ma anche designer con una certa esperienza, sua moglie lo ha supportato a Los Angeles con un nuovo look in pizzo, più sofisticato ma anche più nudo. leggi anche Kanye West, a cena da Cracco a Milano con Bianca Censori. VIDEO
Il look in pizzo per la cena fuori Bianca Censori è apparsa davanti ai fotografi a Los Angeles al seguito di Kanye West col quale ha consumato una cena presso il ristorante francese Gigi's.
Per l'uscita notturna sulle colline di Hollywood l'outfit della donna era un reggiseno nero semitrasparente accoppiato a un paio di calze color carne in pizzo. Ai piedi zatteroni altissimi con la zeppa di sughero e la fascia superiore in plastica trasparente. Censori, coi capelli legati in un raccolto basso si è coperta le parti intime con la pochette nera e così è stata immortalata dai paparazzi che non hanno mancato di scattare foto anche del suo lato B.
Nessuna novità per West che indossava, invece, il solito total black, pantaloni e felpa col cappuccio oversize. Il cantante, a viso scoperto, aveva lo sguardo nascosto da un paio di occhiali scuri. Dopo la fugace apparizione, sufficiente per riempire i social di foto rubate, i due sono saltati a bordo del loro veicolo per scomparire nella notte californiana.

This look can go from the bedroom to the dinner table and back again.
Bianca Censori can’t resist a tights-only outfit, but she switched up her style from sheer hosiery to a lacy look to head out to dinner with husband Kanye West in Los Angeles Thursday night.
The Yeezy architect, 29, enjoyed a date night with the “Gold Digger” rapper, 46, at Gigi’s restaurant while wearing a lingerie-inspired ensemble consisting of a black lace bra and a pair of ivory tights with nothing underneath.

She appeared to have cut the feet out of her lace-patterned hosiery, wearing them with a very early aughts pair of cork-heeled platform sandals.
Censori went without underwear beneath her tights, but covered her private areas with a black purse as she left the French restaurant with West, whom she married in December 2022.
Mrs. West wore her hair in her usual slicked-back style, sporting several simple rings and multiple hoop earrings.
Meanwhile, the “Flashing Lights” singer wore a black hoodie and baggy pants with Nike sneakers, donning a pair of dark shades despite the late hour.

For more Page Six Style …
Censori has been wearing the tights-as-pants aesthetic (going commando or not) for quite some time, causing a stir during Paris Fashion Week when she revealed her undercarriage in a see-through pair of black hosiery in February.
She went for a more opaque version of the look while hitting up Hollywood’s surprising new fave restaurant, The Cheesecake Factory, in March, wearing a fluorescent green pair of tights with no undies and a nude bandeau top.
The Australian beauty also wore lace tights sans pants to hang out with Kim Kardashian at a “Vultures” event and to see a movie with West and his children last month, although she covered up her bottom half with a blue bodysuit for the latter occasion.
With hotter weather ahead, will Censori trade her tights for an even skimpier style? Only time will tell.",2024-04-05T16:24:12Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six

Kanye West Admits He 'Mismanaged' Donda School Funds Amid Lawsuit Filed By Ex-employee,"Donda school controversy is getting complicated by the day as Kanye West is embroiled in a lawsuit filed by his ex-staffer Trevor Philips. The shocking details of the recent case against the controversial rapper involve blowing up the funds of the Christian school, including harassment and racism.

The ex-staffer is exposing the dark secrets of working under Ye and his brand filing charges like harassment, discrimination, a hostile work environment, and multiple other complaints. Now, in the new lawsuit development, Philips has alleged he used tuition fees of Donda Academy's students to fund his personal trips, confirmed The Sun.
He argued in his case that the employees weren't paid their dues and rather he spent that money on his globe-trotting adventures. The Praise God rapper lost his partnership with influential brands like Adidas after he blew up the internet with his anti-semitic remarks and landed into controversy.
Court documents obtained by the outlet revealed, ""Yeezy accounts were frozen and Phillips nor the other Yeezy members were being paid."" He further added that the financial woes escalated since several other business deals were shelved as a consequence of his hate speech against the Jews.
""Upon his return, Kanye gloated to Donda and Yeezy staff, admitting that he mismanaged the schools' money,"" the court documents further read, adding, ""[Kanye] specifically told Phillips and other staff that he spent $2 million of the school budget on his trip to Paris [and] Phillips could not help but wonder if that money included the school children's tuition.""
However, money wasn't the cause of concern for Philips. The court filings also mentioned the ex-employee's X-rated encounter with Ye back on December 2, 2022. He detailed that the meeting first took place in a Nobu hotel room in Malibu, California exactly three days later of his messy divorce with his ex-wife Kim Kardashian.
The plaintiff claimed during his meeting with Philips, Ye FaceTimed a woman, mentioned as a ""female friend,"" and asked her to wear lingerie he bought for her. ""[Trevor] immediately recognized the female's name because only a few weeks earlier, while at the Yeezy headquarters, Kanye had flaunted nude pictures of her to many of the staff members,"" the complaint read.
""The female answered Kanye's call and he commanded her, 'Next time I see you, you better make sure you are wearing the lingerie and the shoes I got you,'"" Philips detailed in the complaint.

Before West's controversies, the musician cemented himself among the top singers in the music industry. His 2004 album The College Dropout proved to be a game changer for the rapper whose career seemed unassailable. He was among the fourth-fastest artists in history to reach a billion streams with 24 Grammy Awards under his name.

Kanye West Faces Lawsuit Over Display of Nude Pictures and Lingerie Demands in Front of Employees,"Kanye West finds himself entangled in a legal battle as a former employee from Donda Academy and Yeezy, steps forward with serious allegations, shedding light on the darker aspects of working under the Yeezy umbrella.
Trevor Phillips, the plaintiff, disclosed unsettling details in court, recounting an uncomfortable encounter with West just days after the finalization of his divorce from Kim Kardashian.
Phillips, the plaintiff, felt particularly uneasy when he met with West on December 2, 2022, three days after his divorce from Kardashian. Phillips stated that he received an invitation from West to meet in a private room at Nobu in Malibu, California. ""[Trevor] immediately recognized the female's name because only a few weeks earlier, while at the Yeezy headquarters, Kanye had flaunted nude pictures of her to many of the staff members,"" the complaint claimed. West allegedly ""FaceTimed a female friend,"" according to court filings.

""The female answered Kanye's call and he commanded her, 'Next time I see you, you better make sure you are wearing the lingerie and the shoes I got you,'"" Phillips said. In a previous report, TMZ disclosed that the complainant claimed West used hate speech against the LGBTQIA+ community and passed racist and antisemitism remarks during a private conversation.
According to Phillips, West also disclosed ""having a porn addiction."" The startling lawsuit filed against West and Donda Academy was made public recently. Donda Academy serves children in pre-K through 12th grade and is situated in the Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.

Phillips worked for West in 2022, and although he was employed to ""increase cotton production"" for Yeezy, his employment eventually began to involve the school because of West's antisemitic outbursts at the time. Phillips claimed that the rapper frequently expressed his antisemitic views to the academy's employees and students.
Additionally, he added that the rapper often used derogatory language, and threatened to shave the heads of two students and put them in cages during one incident. As such, Phillips is suing West on the grounds of a hostile work environment, harassment, and discrimination.

In light of these claims, the rapper's current partner Bianca Censori, 29, too has been pulled into the storm. Bianca has been subject to her fair share of backlash lately due to her revealing fashion choices that were allegedly also orchestrated by West.
Her family highly disapproves of the provocative attires and her father Leo Censori, allegedly contacted the rapper last month, insisting that he come to see him. Leo worries about West's dominating control over his daughter, according to an insider who spoke to Daily Mail, ""Kanye has been invited to go to Australia and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react.""",2024-04-05T12:17:20Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Acusan a Kanye West de ""presumir de las fotos íntimas"" de una amiga ante sus exempleados","La denuncia que Trevor Phillips, exempleado de la Donda Academy de Kanye West, ha interpuesto contra el músico y empresario sigue dando que hablar y sacando a la luz nuevas informaciones. Ahora se ha sabido de algunos comentarios sexuales inapropiados y un comportamiento lascivo que el cantante exhibió frente a sus compañeros de empresa.
Según ha explicado Phillips, en mitad de una cena en un hotel, y queriendo desviar la conversación por los comentarios antisemitas de Ye elogiando a Adolf Hitler, comentó que Zoë Kravitz, que estaba en la televisión en ese momento, le parecía ""guapa"", lo que supuestamente hizo que West le dijese: ""Pues tú te pareces a Zoë Kravitz"".
Aunque luego matizó que más bien era ""guapo al estilo Lenny Kravitz"", estos comentarios le causaron ""incomodidad"", la cual pasó a mayores una vez en la habitación en la que se reunieron, con Kanye ""haciendo movimientos lentos hacia arriba y hacia abajo con su mano justo encima de sus genitales, como si se estuviera masturbando"" a su lado.
El extrabajador, que habla en la demanda de la autodiagnosticada adicción de Kanye a la pornografía, así como su costumbre de tener una orgía al día, ""al menos con dos o tres chicas"", ha afirmado que estaba ""totalmente conmocionado y acongojado"" después de que el rapero continuase con la fingida masturbación, haciéndola todavía más evidente al usar las dos manos.
Asimismo, e inmediatamente después, Kanye comenzó una videollamada con una amiga de la que poco antes había ""hecho alarde de sus fotografías desnuda"" ante su personal. Ha añadido que West, supuestamente, le dijo a esta mujer: ""La próxima vez que te vea más te vale asegurarte de llevar la lencería y los zapatos que te compré"". Eso, ha afirmado Phillips, provocó que se sintiera una vez más ""preocupado e incómodo"".
Afortunadamente, ha explicado en la demanda, fue el servicio de habitaciones quienes, sin saberlo, ""interrumpieron"" el impulso sexual de West. Eso sí, según ha explicitado, no pudieron salir del hotel hasta la 1 de la madrugada, aunque cuando lo hizo sentía ""que les debía algo a sus alumnos"", incluidos su hermano menor y su hija, quienes estudiaban en la Academia Donda, pero ""no solo acerca de su educación, sino también para protegerlos"".",2024-04-05T09:55:57Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos

L’ex-architecte australienne devenue femme de Yeezy, âgé de 29 ans, et le rappeur de 46 ans – qui ont passé le dimanche de Pâques avec ses enfants – ont été repérés en train de dîner ensemble chez Gigi’s à Los Angeles. Pour leur soirée en tête-à-tête, Bianca avait opté pour un soutien-gorge noir décolleté avec des collants en dentelle couleur chair. Elle ne semblait pas porter de sous-vêtements. Elle ne tenait qu’un simple sac à main recouvrant ses zones intimes alors qu’elle cheminait avec son amoureux en direction du restaurant.
Bianca Censori, habituée aux controverses
Bianca Censori n’en est pas à sa première controverse. Mais qui est vraiment cette jeune femme qui fait les gros titres ? Bianca Censori, âgée de 28 ans, est une architecte originaire d’Australie. Cependant, elle est surtout connue pour être la femme de Kanye West. Le couple s’est uni en décembre 2022, seulement un mois après le divorce du rappeur avec Kim Kardashian. Contrairement à l’image de puissance que formaient Kim Kardshian et Kanye, ce n’est pas du tout le cas pour celui qu’il forme désormais avec Bianca Censori. Sur les réseaux sociaux, certains expriment même leur inquiétude pour la jeune femme.

Bianca Censori totalement sous emprise ?
S’inspirant du mouvement #FreeBritney, les internautes commencent à se mobiliser pour dénoncer le traitement infligé à la jeune femme. Sur les réseaux les commentaires fusent. « Elle a besoin d’être sauvée », « Il faut la libérer de l’emprise de Kanye ». Ou encore « Elle est victime d’abus en public » foisonnent sur le web. La raison ? Toujours et encore les tenues audacieuses de Bianca Censori. En février dernier à Paris, elle était déjà sortie dans une tenue très limite provoquant étonnement et stupeur sur la Toile. Quelques semaines plus tard, dans le cadre d’une soirée au Super Bowl, elle est également apparue vêtue d’une sorte de tablier-combinaison, complètement nue en dessous. Et la semaine précédente, elle a été aperçue se promenant dans les rues de Los Angeles, revêtue d’un imperméable transparent. Chaque sortie publique est véritable tollé sur la Toile !
Alors que certains peuvent voir cela comme une lubie de fashionista, d’autres ont une toute autre lecture. C’est surtout une preuve qu’elle est totalement sous l’emprise de Kanye West. Ce dernier contrôlerait son apparence. Et pas qu’un peu ! Il la sexualiserait au maximum. Il la traiterait selon certains comme « une sorte de poupée-trophée ». Le rappeur chercherait-il à stimuler les ventes de son prochain album « Vulture 2 » ? Il faut dire que la sortie serait imminente. Pour beaucoup, il ne fait aucun doute que Kanye utilise le corps de sa femme comme un simple outil marketing.",2024-04-05T09:03:22Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
Yeezy architect Bianca Censori steps out in sheer tights revealing her bare bottom with husband Kanye West,"Another day, another outrageous ensemble worn by Bianca Censori as she grabbed dinner in LA with her rapper husband Kanye West.
The pair were seen leaving French restaurant Gigi’s in Los Angeles on Wednesday night and it comes as no surprise that they turned heads.
Censori’s date night ‘outfit’ was a black lacey balconette bra, flesh-coloured lace tights with a floral pattern and chunky cork heels.
The 29-year-old appeared to be going for a nude look and did not seem to be wearing any underwear, exposing her backside and using a purse to cover her front area.

By her side, kindly making sure she didn’t suffer a nip slip, was Kanye wearing a black boxy hoodie and black baggy pants, accessorising with black airforce ones and slim rectangular shades.
This isn’t the first time Bianca has donned see-through bottoms.
She copped severe backlash recently when she was snapped by paparazzi in France panty-free and could’ve faced a huge fine of more than $16,000 for indecent exposure.
It was later revealed that a Hollywood special effects trick was used to achieve the revealing garb, and she was off the hook.
Censori and Kanye are also wanted back home in Australia after her dad Leo demanded the pair fly back to chat about her behaviour, seemingly under the control of West.
After it was reported that her mother Alexandra couldn’t get through to the scantily-clad beauty, sources revealed that Leo planned to sit down with Kanye and he would “not be intimidated by Kanye’s power or control”.
According to sources close to the couple Censori was “hesitant” about seeing her dad face-to-face.",2024-04-05T05:27:20Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow

They visited Gigi's in Los Angeles, California - an upscale French restaurant.
The rapper was hiding behind his typical all-black aesthetic and a baggy jacket, but Bianca wasn't so lucky.
She wore next to nothing while awkwardly strolling into the restaurant.
As a top, she wore a lacy lowcut black bra that exposed a lot of her cleavage, her back, and her stomach.
On the bottom, she was only wearing a pair of nude high-waisted lace tights that were completely see-through.
She wasn't wearing any underwear - which was clear from any photos taken of her back.
The architect did attempt to keep her modesty by placing a small black purse over her crotch as she walked.
Her outfit was completed with a pair of sky-high cork-heeled wedges that appeared to be about six inches tall.
The top of the shoes was made of a clear plastic completing her nude illusion.
Not to distract from the rest of her look, Bianca's hair was slicked back in a bun and she wore minimal makeup.

OH, BIANCA
Critics on X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram caught a glimpse of Bianca's outfit and dragged her.
Others were genuinely concerned with how upset and downcast she appeared in the photos.
One said, ""Everything Bianca Censori wears is ugly. Like, be so for real. Put an actual outfit on, please.""
""Every time I see a video of Kanye and Bianca Censori out and about I get major Sims waiting for directions vibes from her.

""She seems lost, scared, and confused,"" added another.
A third wrote, ""There needs to be an intervention!!!""
""If she looked confident, it’d be a different story, but maybe this is just a shot of her looking meek, timid, and uncomfortable,"" commented a fan.
A fifth said, ""She always looks so scared and uncomfortable idk maybe it’s just me.""
Another user wrote, ""Does anyone else think she looks embarrassed and awkward? Bless her!""
Fans have been growing more and more concerned with Bianca's safety and the status of her marriage over the past few months.
In March, she was seen at The Cheesecake Factory with Kanye, and she appeared to be down in the dumps.
Their marriage has also impacted Bianca's relationship with her parents as they don't approve of her current lifestyle.
Her father Leo Censori wants to have a sitdown with the rapper, but Bianca has done everything she can to prevent them from meeting.

Sprach Kanye West mit Mitarbeitern über tägliche Orgien?,"Kanye West (46) wird von einem früheren Mitarbeiter verklagt. Trevor Phillips arbeitete zunächst für die Bekleidungsmarke des umstrittenen Rappers, wurde dann jedoch mit mehr und mehr Aufgaben mit Bezug zu seiner nicht akkreditierten Schule, der Donda Academy, beauftragt. Während der geschäftlichen Besprechungen soll Kanye durch unangemessenes Verhalten und Äußerungen aufgefallen sein. Laut den Gerichtsunterlagen, die Mirror vorliegen, soll er angeblich gesagt haben: ""Früher hatte ich jeden Tag Orgien, mindestens zwei bis drei Mädchen. Und jetzt kann ich mich nicht einmal mehr hinlegen, ohne mir einen runterzuholen."" Eigentlich haben sie wohl den Lehrplan und Gartenbau der Akademie planen wollen.
In der Klageschrift heißt es weiter: ""Nur wenige Augenblicke später, während er flach auf dem Bett lag und zur Decke starrte, begann Kanye mit seiner Hand direkt über seinen Genitalien langsame Auf- und Abbewegungen zu machen, als ob er masturbieren würde."" Dann soll er seine zweite Hand genutzt haben, um in einer dramatischen Geste die andere zu ergreifen und festzuhalten. Laut Trevor habe der ""Runaway""-Interpret im Anschluss erklärt, er müsse seine Hände von seinem Handy lassen, um sich davon abzuhalten zu können, Pornos anzugucken.
In der Klage geht es jedoch nicht nur um Interaktionen zwischen Kanye und seinem Ex-Mitarbeiter. Auch das schädliche Lernumfeld der Schule findet Erwähnung. Den Gerichtsdokumenten zufolge drohte der Ex von Kim Kardashian (43) zwei seiner Schüler damit, dass er ""ihre Köpfe rasieren wolle"" und ""beabsichtige, ein Gefängnis in der Schule zu errichten"". Neben einer Schadenersatzzahlung möchte Trevor auch eine einstweilige Verfügung erzielen, die es Kanye verbieten würde, künftig in Kalifornien Schulen für unter 18-Jährige zu eröffnen.

Kanye West allegedly made inappropriate sexual remarks and exhibited lewd behavior around Yeezy colleagues, a new lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Tuesday by a former staffer claims.
Trevor Phillips alleges in the complaint obtained by Page Six that the music mogul-turned-private school founder flaunted nude photos of a female friend to staffers and even once simulated masturbation in front of him during a meeting at Nobu Hotel in Malibu, Calif.
The former employee — who was hired to work at Yeezy to grow cotton for a kids’ clothing line and food for an eventual self-sustainable community — claims when he first arrived at the hotel, West was spewing conspiracy theories about the Jewish community and praising Adolf Hitler.

In an effort to divert the conversation, Phillips commented that Zoë Kravitz — who was on the TV at the time — was “pretty,” which allegedly prompted West to tell his then-staffer, “You look like Zoë Kravitz.”
The “All of the Lights” rapper allegedly then clarified, “Yeah you look like her… But, not like that. You are handsome like in a Lenny Kravitz type of way,” but the comments still caused Phillips “discomfort.”
“Just a few moments later while lying flat on the bed and staring up at the ceiling, Kanye began to make slow up and down motions with his hand just above his genitals – as though he was masturbating,” Phillips then claims, per the lawsuit.

The former staffer alleges the Yeezy CEO then told him, “I used to have orgies every day – at least two-to-three girls. And now, man, I can’t even lay down without jacking off.”
Per the suit, West, 41, allegedly used one of his hands to “forcefully and dramatically” grab and pull the other hand “making the masturbatory gestures away from his crotch.”
“I got to keep my hand away from my phone to keep me away from looking at pornos,” he allegedly then said, according to Phillips, who was “totally shocked and distraught” by what he allegedly witnessed.

Kanye West sparks new debate with his wild bid,"Kanye West sparks new debate with his wild bid
Kanye West, who knows the art to attract the spotlight, has made yet another wild bid to stage live shows at new 7 Wonders of the World sites, but his ""insane"" plan is rejected.
The Gold Digger rapper's recent efforts to organize concerts in Europe, South America, the Middle East, and Asia have all ended in failure, according to The US Sun.
Kim Kardashian's ex-husband has been advised to abandon ridiculously ambitious plans to perform at all seven wonders of the world sites, such as the Great Wall of China and India's Taj Mahal, two well-placed sources told the outlet.
Kanye, officially know Ye, was reportedly prepared to offer up to $6 million to secure these locations.
However, UNESCO and various cultural agencies have reportedly rejected these ""insane"" proposals, with one individual who has worked for over 15 years in managing and conserving world heritage sites deeming the offers ""impossible to accept.""
""Kanye is a superstar and loves to undertake grand, unconventional endeavors, but requests of this nature are simply unfeasible,"" remarked a UNESCO consultant.
""Imagine staging a show or event at the Colosseum in Rome? Or at the Taj Mahal in India? Or even at Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro? It would be utter chaos. These sites are not intended for events of this nature.""
Meanwhile, Kanye, new album Vultures 1 soared to the top of the charts despite ongoing controversies.

"Kanye West Desired to Have a ‘Jail’ at His School and Wanted Students’ Heads Shaved, Lawsuit Claims","It appears Kanye West might not be the most ideal boss. Trevor Phillips, a former employee at West's Donda Academy and Yeezy fashion brand, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles alleging that West engaged in racism, homophobia, antisemitism, and harassment towards the school's students and staff, as reported by HuffPost. Phillips also claimed that West made discriminatory comments and likened himself to Adolf Hitler while managing his private school. Allegedly, West wanted children to be confined in cages and have their heads shaved.

Phillips also accused West of fostering a hostile work environment and retaliating against him when he raised concerns about unsafe conditions and other problems at Donda Academy. According to the lawsuit, Phillips was initially hired by the rapper to work on Yeezy in November 2022, a time when many businesses were severing ties with West due to his public antisemitic outbursts. Phillips also claimed that during his time at the school, he heard West make derogatory remarks about gay and Jewish individuals. Additionally, he witnessed the rapper treating Black staff members at the school unfairly.
As reported by Entertainment Weekly, the lawsuit read, ""From the start of Phillips’ tenure working at Yeezy and Donda, it was immediately apparent to him, and others, that Kanye treated the Black staff considerably worse than white employees. Even when class was in session, Kanye would scream and berate Black employees, while never even as much raising his tone at the white staff."" While speaking about two students, Phillips claimed that West “wanted them to shave their heads and that he intended to put a jail at the school — and that they could be locked in cages.”
When Phillips raised issues about West's behavior, things got even worse. The suit says the rapper “responded mercilessly, with incessant harassment, humiliation, and attempts to both mentally control, and destroy, Phillips.” In Phillips' lawsuit, he also alleged that West seemed to dismiss and rehire him randomly, but his final dismissal occurred during a Sunday service at the school last May. Phillips claims that during the altercation, West confronted him about a garden project and yelled at him. In front of several people, West shouted, “I was going to punch you in the face.""

Additionally, Phillips is also pursuing over $35,000 in damages, as stated in the complaint. The lawsuit also stated that West ""spew forth hate, profess antisemitic tropes and lies, threaten the LGBTQ+ community, and even on one occasion, almost sexually stimulate himself."" In the meantime, Phillips isn't the sole individual pursuing legal recourse concerning West and Donda Academy.

Kanye West: Κατηγορείται ότι απείλησε να κλειδώσει μαθητές σε κλουβιά,"Your browser does not support the audio element.
Ένας πρώην υπάλληλος ισχυρίζεται ότι o μουσικός συμπεριφέρθηκε ρατσιστικά σε μαύρους υπαλλήλους και απείλησε παιδιά
Ο Kanye West, μάλλον, δεν είναι το καλύτερο αφεντικό στον κόσμο. Ο Trevor Phillips, πρώην υπάλληλος της ακαδημίας Donda Academy και της μάρκας μόδας Yeezy του ράπερ, κατέθεσε την Τρίτη αγωγή στο Λος Άντζελες, με την οποία κατηγορεί τον West για ρατσισμό, ομοφοβία, αντισημιτισμό και παρενόχληση τόσο κατά των μαθητών της σχολής όσο και κατά των υπαλλήλων.
«Ο Kanye συμπεριφερόταν ρατσιστικά απέναντι στους μαύρους υπαλλήλους του. Ακόμη και όταν γινόταν μάθημα, ο καλλιτέχνης φώναζε και έβριζε τους μαύρους υπαλλήλους», σύμφωνα με την αγωγή.
Ο Phillips ισχυρίζεται, επίσης, ότι είδε τον Kanye West «να απειλεί την LGBTQ+ κοινότητα και μάλιστα σε μια περίπτωση, σχεδόν, να διεγείρει σεξουαλικά τον εαυτό του». Ο Phillips φέρεται επίσης να είδε τον West να παρενοχλεί μαθητές της Donda Academy, απειλώντας να τους ξυρίσει τα κεφάλια και να τους κλειδώσει σε ένα κλουβί.
Ο Phillips προσλήφθηκε αρχικά το 2022 για να εργαστεί στο Yeezy, το εμπορικό σήμα μόδας του West, αλλά τελικά εργάστηκε και στη Donda Academy, το χριστιανικό σχολείο Κ-12 που ίδρυσε ο West.

Αφού ο διάσημος καλλιτέχνης μίλησε για το πόσο θαύμαζε τον Αδόλφο Χίτλερ και μισούσε τους Εβραίους τον Δεκέμβριο του 2022, οι επιχειρηματικές του σχέσεις με μάρκες, όπως η Adidas, κατέρρευσαν και η περιουσία του μειώθηκε δραματικά, όπως αναφέρει η αγωγή. Με τους λογαριασμούς του Yeezy να έχουν «παγώσει» από την Adidas, ο Phillips πληρώθηκε με χρήματα από τη Donda Academy και άρχισε να εργάζεται και εκεί.
Η αγωγή περιγράφει, επίσης, λεπτομερώς μερικά συγκεκριμένα περιστατικά περίεργης συμπεριφοράς του West. Σε μια συνάντηση τόσο με το προσωπικό της Donda Academy όσο και με δύο σπουδαστές, η αγωγή υποστηρίζει ότι: «Ο Kanye άρχισε να συζητά ανοιχτά για το πώς του αρέσει να βγαίνει μόνο με λευκές γυναίκες. Στη συνέχεια, απευθυνόμενος στους δύο μαθητές, ο Kanye τους είπε ότι ήθελε να ξυρίσουν τα κεφάλια τους και ότι θα μπορούσαν να κλειδωθούν σε κλουβιά».
Ο Phillips υποστηρίζει, επίσης, ότι ο Kanye West τον παρενόχλησε σεξουαλικά σε μια συνάντησή τους, μιλώντας του για πορνό και όργια. Ισχυρίζεται ότι κακοποιήθηκε επανειλημμένα και ταπεινώθηκε μπροστά σε άλλους υπαλλήλους και το προσωπικό, ενώ δεν του καταβλήθηκε ποτέ αποζημίωση μετά το κλείσιμο της Donda Academy, τον Αύγουστο του 2023.

"""Hitler level stuff"": Kanye West faces new lawsuit alleging antisemitism and abuse at Donda Academy","Kanye West (who also goes by the name Ye) was sued on Tuesday by a former employee who accused the rapper of threatening staff and students at Donda Academy, West's private and unaccredited Christian school in Ventura County, Calif.
Filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Trevor Phillips, the 47-page lawsuit also claimed that West engaged in discriminatory and antisemitic behavior, likening himself to Adolf Hitler and creating a hostile work environment. Phillips worked for both Donda Academy and West's fashion brand, Yeezy, from November 2022 to August 2023. The suit states that Phillips’ daughter and younger brother attended Donda, and that Phillips’ mother assisted him in getting the job. He was hired shortly after the rap mogul's businesses began to flounder and his major-record label was cast into jeopardy, following his repeated antisemitic comments. Notably, West at the time tweeted that he would support ""death con 3 ON JEWISH PEOPLE,"" causing X/Twitter and Instagram to subsequently restrict his account.
Phillips' suit states that he was initially hired to assist with “projects related to growing cotton” and other plants in an effort to make Yeezy ""self-sustainable,"" before shifting to his role at Donda Academy. The former staffer asserted that West continued to make antisemitic remarks in front of employees at the school, including “the Jews are out to get me” and “the Jews are stealing all my money,"" per a report from The New York Times. After sports empire Adidas severed ties with West in October of 2022 over his statements, the music artist reportedly told Phillips, “The Jews are working with Adidas to freeze up my money to try and make me broke!"" per the lawsuit.
West ultimately issued an apology to the Jewish community last year, releasing a statement written in Hebrew that said, ""It was not my intention to offend or disrespect and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused.” The apology also claimed that he was committed “to learning from this experience to ensure greater sensitivity and understanding.” Phillips however, in the latest in a series of lawsuits filed by former Donda employees, alleged that West continued to make antisemitic comments behind closed doors at work. The lawsuit says that West during one dinner at high-end sushi restaurant Nobu pretended to masturbate and described his sex life in detail to Phillips, who believed the meeting was concerning Donda's horticulture program, per Business Insider. West also during the meeting referred to the Holocaust as ""fake"" and called Hitler ""great,"" saying that the German dictator responsible for a genocide that killed millions was an ""innovator.""
""He invented so many things. He’s the reason we have cars,"" the complaint purports West to have said. During the same conversation, the suit claims, West said, “Yeah I am going for the gays! FIRST the Jews, THEN the gays.”
""Gay people are not true Christians,"" the suit quotes West to have said. ""And Gay people are controlled by Bill Gates so that they don't have children for population control.""
Text messages from another conversation about seeds for the Donda Academy garden reportedly show West to have said, ""I am on some complete Hitler level stuff. Minus the gas chambers. In Jesus name.""
""Phillips, on several occasions, witnessed Kanye preach to his staff obscenities such as 'the Jews are out to get me' and 'the Jews are stealing all my money,'"" the suit reads. ""Fearing for their jobs and also to de-escalate Kanye's absurdities (so that the two present school children did not hear), the school staff did their best to ignore him.""
The complaint also accuses West of threatening two Donda Academy students, reportedly telling the children that he ""wanted them to shave their heads and that he intended to put a jail at the school — and that they could be locked in cages.”
“The staff quickly distracted the children and escorted them out of the room,"" the lawsuit says.
Phillips, who is Black, also detailed how West allegedly treated Black employees at Donda, including himself, “considerably worse than white employees.” At Paris Fashion Week in the fall of 2022, West wore a shirt that featured a slogan of white supremacists — ""White Lives Matter "" — which is deemed hate speech by the Anti-Defamation League.
Business Insider reported that Phillips is seeking $35,000 in damages and an injunction to prohibit West from owning and operating any sort of educational school for kids under 18 years of age in the state of California. ""By filing this lawsuit, we hope our injured clients' rights are vindicated, and that the famous artist Mr. West understands that his messages — which we alleged preach discrimination, antisemitism, and Hitler-love — have no place in the world,"" Carney R. Shegerian, whose law firm is representing Phillips, told the outlet.",2024-04-03T23:48:18Z,https://www.salon.com,Salon
Neue Klage: Wollte Kanye West ein Schulgefängnis errichten?,"Neue Vorwürfe gegen Kanye West (46) – er wird erneut wegen seiner Schule, der Donda Academy, verklagt. Bereits vor einem Jahr wurden Anschuldigungen wegen mehrfacher Gesundheits- und Sicherheitsverstöße sowie rechtswidriger Erziehungspraktiken gegen den Rapper laut. Jetzt wird Kanye von dem ehemaligen Mitarbeiter Trevor Philips verklagt, wie Mirror bekannt gibt. Den Gerichtsdokumenten zufolge drohte der ""Black Skinhead""-Interpret zwei seiner Schüler damit, dass er ""ihre Köpfe rasieren wolle"" und ""beabsichtige, ein Gefängnis in der Schule zu errichten"". Darüber hinaus soll er ""stolz"" antisemitische Hassreden vor seiner Schülerschaft gehalten haben. Insgesamt habe er in seiner mittlerweile geschlossenen Schule ein schädliches Lernumfeld geschaffen.
Die Liste der Vorwürfe ist lang: Kanye soll Rassismus, Antisemitismus und Homophobie gefördert haben. ""Ja, ich hole mir die Schwulen! Erst die Juden, dann die Schwulen"", soll er laut Trevor gesagt und im Anschluss behauptet haben, Bill Gates (68) ""kontrolliere"" Homosexuelle. Schwarze Angestellte der Schule sollen spürbar schlechter behandelt worden sein als ihre weißen Kollegen. Sein Verhalten sei ""unablässig unangemessen"" gewesen, er habe unter anderem seine ""offensichtliche Erregung"" vor seinen Mitarbeitern zur Schau gestellt. Mit seiner Klage möchte Trevor neben einer Schadensersatzzahlung auch eine einstweilige Verfügung erreichen, die es Kanye verbieten würde, in Kalifornien künftig Schulen für unter 18-Jährige zu eröffnen.
Trotz aller Anschuldigungen ist der umstrittene Musiker offenbar noch immer überzeugt von seinem Konzept. Im Februar attackierte er seine Ex-Frau Kim Kardashian (43) auf X und forderte, dass sie die gemeinsamen Kids von ihrer derzeitigen Schule ab- und stattdessen in seiner Akademie anmelden solle. Die staatlich anerkannte Schule Sierra Canyon, die ihr Nachwuchs derzeit besucht, sei die ""falsche Schule für Berühmtheiten, die vom System benutzt werden"".

(CNN) -- Un exempleado de Kanye West presentó una demanda en la que acusa al polémico artista de acoso, discriminación y represalias, entre otros señalamientos.
Trevor Phillips presentó la demanda este martes contra el rapero, cuyo nombre legal es Ye, así como contra su compañía Yeezy y su escuela privada cristiana K-12, Donda Academy, cuya sede está en Los Ángeles.
En la demanda obtenida por CNN, Phillips asegura que West “trataba al personal negro considerablemente peor que a los empleados blancos”, calificando la discriminación de “grave”.
""Incluso cuando la clase estaba en medio de una sesión, Kanye gritaba y reprendía a los empleados negros, sin siquiera elevar el tono ante el personal blanco"", relata la demanda. ""A menudo, Kanye apuntó contra Phillips, un hombre negro, no solo con este comportamiento dispar y acosador, sino con un desdén total y absoluto"".
El exempleado afirma además que fue testigo de cómo West “pronunciaba discurso de odio, profesaba tropos y mentiras antisemitas, amenazaba a la comunidad LGBTQ+ e incluso, en una ocasión, casi se estimuló sexualmente”.

“Ya en desventaja debido a su color de piel, cuando Phillips rechazó la intolerancia de Kanye y sus órdenes de violar la ley, se convirtió en un objetivo aún mayor”, señaló la demanda. “A cambio, Kanye respondió sin piedad, con acoso incesante, humillación e intentos de controlar y destruir mentalmente a Phillips. La mala voluntad de Kanye hacia el demandante finalmente culminó en una vulgar reprimenda frente a los alumnos y sus padres. Kanye incluso amenazó a Phillips con violencia física”, añadió.
Según la demanda, Phillips fue contratado alrededor de noviembre de 2022 para trabajar para la marca de moda Yeezy de West, pero su puesto finalmente se expandió para incluir el trabajo en Donda Academy, la escuela que West fundó y nombró en honor a su difunta madre.
En octubre de 2022, West usó una camiseta de “White Lives Matter” y vistió a varias modelos negras con prendas que llevaban la misma frase en su desfile de YZY en la semana de la moda de París; La Liga Antidifamación ha vinculado este lema al Ku Klux Klan.
Luego, en un episodio de 45 minutos del podcast “Drink Champs” ese mismo mes, el rapero hizo numerosos comentarios escandalosos y antisemitas que causaron repercusiones financieras para él y sus socios de marca.
West continuó reiterando sus comentarios, los cuales algunos consideraron antisemitas y antinegros.
La demanda hace referencia a los comentarios y publicaciones de West en las redes sociales en ese momento.
""Durante esas entrevistas, Kanye defendió de manera jactanciosa y deplorable su arraigado antisemitismo y su odio por el pueblo judío, haciendo eco de tropos que han estereotipado a los judíos durante gran parte de la historia"", afirmó la demanda.
La demanda también indicó que West “promocionó con orgullo sus conspiraciones discriminatorias contra los judíos durante una reunión en la Academia Donda”. Phillips, afirmó, ""en varias ocasiones fue testigo de cómo Kanye predicaba obscenidades a su personal"".
""Temiendo por sus trabajos y también para reducir los absurdos de Kanye (para que los dos niños presentes en la escuela no lo escucharan), el personal de la escuela hizo todo lo posible por ignorarlo"", afirmó la demanda. “Sin embargo, frente a dos estudiantes, Kanye continuó con su peligrosa retórica”.
Kanye, según la demanda, ""comenzó a decir abiertamente que solo le gusta salir con mujeres blancas"", y en un momento, les dijo a dos alumnos ""que quería que se afeitaran la cabeza y que tenía la intención de poner una cárcel en la escuela y que podrían ser encerrados en jaulas”.
Según reportes, la escuela cerró en 2023, pero la demanda dice que ""de acuerdo a información creíble, Donda Academy todavía funciona hasta el día de hoy"".
CNN contactó a Donda Academy para solicitar comentarios. Un número de teléfono que figura en el sitio web del Departamento de Educación de California ya no está disponible.
En la demanda, Phillips también mencionó una reunión incómoda de tres horas que dice haber tenido con West en la que su entonces jefe elogió a Hitler y dijo que ""los homosexuales no son verdaderos cristianos"".
La demanda estableció que el empleo de Phillips en Donda Academy terminó en agosto de 2023.
Phillips busca un juicio con jurado y un mínimo de US$ 35.000 en daños y perjuicios.
En diciembre de 2023, West publicó una disculpa ante la comunidad judía por cualquier “estallido involuntario causado” por sus “palabras o acciones”.

"School of horrors? Kanye West threatened to lock kids in cages, suit says","An explosive new lawsuit adds to the troubling picture of Kanye West’s private Christian school, with a former employee alleging that the rapper and fashion mogul once told two young students that he wanted to “shave their heads” and lock them in “cages.”
The former employee at West’s Donda Academy further accused the artist, also known as Ye, of creating a hostile work environment by spewing antisemitic remarks at staff meetings, including by allegedly saying “the Jews are out to get me” and “the Jews are stealing all my money,” according to reports by The Daily Beast and the New York Times.
When West summoned the employee, Trevor Phillips, for a private meeting at the Nobu Hotel in Malibu, Phillips’ lawsuit said the rapper spent three hours denying the Holocaust, complimenting Hitler and attacking the LGBTQ community, by saying that “Gay people are not true Christians.”
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, is the latest legal action filed by former employees of West’s embattled K-8 school, which has been shrouded in mystery ever since it opened. The status of the Simi Valley school is currently not known, the New York Times said.
Named for West’s late mother, the school is unaccredited, but reportedly charged $15,000 a year and required parents to sign non-disclosure agreements to prevent leaks. During an interview with “Good Morning America” in 2022, West called Donda Academy his “gospel school,” saying that it gives “kids practical tools that they need in a world post the iPhone being created.”
Last year, three former teachers filed wrongful termination lawsuits, portraying the school as a “dystopian institution designed to satisfy Ye’s idiosyncrasies,” NBC News reported. The teachers alleged that they were fired in retaliation for reporting code violations. The teachers claimed there were no janitorial services or medical staff and that forks, jewelry and clothes that weren’t black or designed by West were banned. The teachers, who are Black, also claimed that they faced racial discrimination and that administrators failed to respond to severe bullying.
In the new suit, Phillips said he was hired in November 2022, around the time that West launched a series of public antisemitic rants that lost him a major-label record deal, the New York Times said. Adidas and Gap also cut business ties with Yeezy, West’s fashion brand.
Phillips said he initially was hired to oversee “projects related to growing cotton” and other plants in an effort to make Yeezy “self-sustainable. But Phillips then went to work Donda Academy, the Daily Beast and New York Times said. In this hybrid role, Phillips said he was was expected to always be on call despite not receiving his full salary, the Daily Beast reported.
At Donda Academy, Phillips’ lawsuit alleged that West boasted about using school funds to help fund a multimillion-dollar trip to Paris. More troubling, the lawsuit said that West touted his “discriminatory conspiracies of Jews during meetings,” which staffers felt they needed to ignore out of fear of losing their jobs. The lawsuit also contained a screenshot of a text message West allegedly sent to Phillips taking issue with how he carried out a task. “I am on some complete Hitler level stuff,” West said, adding, “Minus the gas chambers.”
Phillips’ lawsuit also recounted a conversation he witnessed West have in front of two students. The suit alleged that West “started to openly discuss how he only likes to date white women.” West then turned his attention to two young students, telling them that “he wanted them to shave their heads and that he intended to put a jail at the school—and that they could be locked in cages,” the lawsuit said. “The staff quickly distracted the children, and escorted them out of the room,” the lawsuit said.",2024-04-03T19:31:15Z,https://www.mercurynews.com,The Mercury News
Kanye West accused of discrimination and harassment by former employee,"CNN —
A former employee of Kanye West has filed suit accusing the controversial artist of harassment, discrimination and retaliation, among other allegations.
Trevor Phillips filed the lawsuit Tuesday against the rapper, whose legal name is Ye, as well as his Yeezy company and his Los Angeles-based K-12 Christian private school Donda Academy.
In the suit obtained by CNN, Phillips alleges that West “treated the black staff considerably worse than white employees,” calling the discrimination “severe.”
“Even when class was in session, Kanye would scream and berate black employees, while never even as much raising his tone at the white staff,” the suit alleges. “Often, Kanye targeted Phillips – a black man – not just with this disparate and harassing behavior, but complete and utter disdain.”
The former employee further alleges that he witnessed West “spew forth hate, profess antisemitic tropes and lies, threaten the LGBTQ+ community, and even on one occasion, almost sexually stimulate himself.”
CNN has reached out to a representative for West for comment.
“Already at a disadvantage because of his skin color, once Phillips pushed back against Kanye’s bigotry and instructions to violate the law, he became an even bigger target,” according to the suit. “In return, Kanye responded mercilessly, with incessant harassment, humiliation, and attempts to both mentally control, and destroy, Phillips. Kanye’s ill-will towards the plaintiff ultimately culminated in a vulgar lashing in front of schoolchildren and their parents. Kanye even threatened Phillips with physical violence.”
According to the suit, Phillips was hired around November 2022 to work for West’s Yeezy fashion brand, but his position eventually expanded to include working at Donda Academy, the school West founded and named for his late mother.
In October 2022, West wore a “White Lives Matter” t-shirt and dressed several Black models in clothing with the same phrase at his YZY runway show at Paris fashion week; the slogan has been linked by the Anti-Defamation League to the Ku Klux Klan.
Then in a 45-minute “Drink Champs” podcast episode later that month, the rapper made numerous outrageous and antisemitic comments that caused financial repercussions for him and his brand partners.
West continued to reiterate his comments that some deemed antisemitic and anti-black.
The suit makes reference to West’s comments and social media posts at the time.
“During those interviews, Kanye boastfully and deplorably championed his deep-rooted antisemitism and hate for the Jewish people, echoing tropes that have stereotyped Jews for much of history,” the suit states.
The suit also alleges that West “proudly touted his discriminatory conspiracies of Jews during meeting at the Donda Academy.” Phillips, it states “on several occasions, witnessed Kanye preach to his staff obscenities.”
“Fearing for their jobs and also to de-escalate Kanye’s absurdities (so that the two present school children did not hear), the school staff did their best to ignore him,” the suit states. “However, in front of the two schoolchildren, Kanye continued his dangerous rhetoric.”
Kanye, the suit alleges, “started to openly discuss how he only likes to date white women,” and at one point, told two school children “that he wanted them to shave their heads and that he intended to put a jail at the school – and that they could be locked in cages.”
The school reportedly shut down in 2023, but the lawsuit says “on information and belief, Donda Academy still operates to this day.”
CNN reached out to the Donda Academy for comment. A phone number listed for the school on the California Department of Education website is no longer in service.
In the suit, Phillips also alleges an uncomfortable three hour meeting he says he had with West in which his then-boss raved about Hitler and said “gay people are not true Christians.”
The suit states that Phillips’ employment with Donda Academy ended in August 2023.
Phillips is seeking a jury trial and a minimum of $35,000 in damages.
In December 2023, West posted an apology to the Jewish community for any “unintended outburst caused” by his “words or actions.”

Kanye West Allegedly Imitated Super Mario In Threats To Staffer,"Ye, the rapper known by most as Kanye West, is the subject of a new lawsuit from an ex-employee who alleges he subjected staff to an abusive work environment. The lawsuit alleges that West imitated Nintendo’s beloved video game icon, Mario, of Super Mario Bros. fame, while threatening his staffers.

Rolling Stone’s coverage of the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit states that Trevor Phillips, a former employee of Ye’s Yeezy fashion brand, said his relationship with the rapper/entrepreneur had “soured” by May 2023, after West allegedly threw a “temper tantrum” and threatened to punch him. The lawsuit alleges the inciting incident was that West was unhappy with a garden Phillips was tending at Donda Academy, the private school founded by West and named after his late mother.

This led to West allegedly screaming at Phillips in front of a crowd of people, saying he was “fucking fired.” Phillips claims he attempted to plead his case and reminded West that his daughter and younger brother attended Donda, and pointed to an undiagnosed medical condition he was reportedly suffering from. The suit claims West responded by pointing at Phillips and screaming, “Fuck your neck,” then pointed at the school and said, “and fuck your daughter. I don’t give a fuck about none of that.”

West then allegedly attempted to pick up the garden Phillips was working on but was “too weak and out of shape” to pick the entire display up, according to the suit. The lawsuit states West then “physically threatened” Phillips, saying he was “going to punch [Phillips] in the face.” Then, the lawsuit describes a sudden shift in mood, in which West imitated the “celebratory dance of Mario from the famous video game Super Mario Brothers.” West “jumped up [...] punching one fist in the air while he said, ‘I’m gonna give you one more chance. Another life.’” Phillips is seeking $35,000 in damages.

Elsewhere in the suit, Phillips, who is Black, alleges West would give preferential treatment to white employees.
“During his tenure, Phillips never witnessed West yell and berate a white person, but on countless occasions he saw and/or personally experienced Kanye frenziedly yell at Black people,” the lawsuit reads.

Phillips also claims he overheard West saying he wanted to “shave [Donda students’] heads and that he intended to put a jail at the school—and that they could be locked in cages.” Among the many disturbing claims, Phillips says West would frequently proclaim admiration for Nazi leader Adolf Hitler (which he has previously done publicly). The suit also alleges West would say antisemitic and homophobic statements in work environments, threatening violence towards Jewish and gay people while touting conspiracy theories, such as saying, “I am going for the gays! First the Jews, then the gays…gay people are not true Christians. And gay people are controlled by Bill Gates so that they don’t have children for population control.”
West’s antisemitic comments have been well-documented in recent years and even resulted in him losing a deal with shoe-maker Adidas and being banned from X (formerly Twitter) in 2022. His profile has since been reinstated but has been scrubbed of most of its posts.

Kanye West, también conocido solo como Ye, fue demandado por un ex empleado de la Academia Donda, la escuela privada que fundó en 2022. Las alegaciones contra el rapero y ex candidato presidencial van desde fomentar antisemitismo y el racismo hasta normativas radicales entre los estudiantes como pedir que se rapen la cabeza.
El denunciante, identificado como Trevor Phillips, comenzó un proceso judicial contra el cantante, su línea de moda Yeezy (en la que también trabaja Bianca Censori, esposa de Kanye) y, finalmente, su institución educativa cristiana que se ubica en Simi Valley, California, Estados Unidos.

Según un documento de 42 páginas obtenido por USA Today, Phillips “sufrió una grave discriminación, acoso y represalias directamente por Kanye West”. Oficialmente, el hombre formalizó la demanda el pasado martes 2 de abril en la Corte Superior del condado de Los Ángeles.
Trevor trabajó durante nueve meses para Yeezy y Donda Academy, y los inconvenientes laborales iniciaron cuando “se opuso al fanatismo de Kanye y a sus instrucciones de violar la ley”. En la demanda, él detalla que fue testigo de las expresiones de odio por parte de West, quien esparció “mentiras antisemitas” y “amenazas hacia a la comunidad LGBTQ+”. Incluso, presenció al artista en el momento de “casi estimularse sexualmente a sí mismo”.

Acusación de racismo contra Kanye West
Trevor Phillips aseguró que Kanye West trataba a los empleados afroamericanos “considerablemente peor que a los blancos”. En el documento, se relata que el magnate y músico “gritaba y reprendía a los empleados negros” durante las clases, pero no hacía lo mismo con los trabajadores blancos. “A menudo, Kanye se dirigía a Phillips -un hombre negro- no sólo con este comportamiento dispar y acosador, sino con total y absoluto desprecio”, continúa en la demanda.
Pero no se detuvo allí. En algún punto de su tiempo en la escuela, el demandante hizo saber su preocupación por estar en una notable desventaja por su color de piel y eso solo provocó que se convirtiera en un objetivo aún mayor: “Kanye respondió sin piedad, con incesante acoso, humillación e intentos de controlar mentalmente y destruir a Phillips. [...] Kanye incluso amenazó a Phillips con violencia física”.

Retórica nazi y estudiantes con la cabeza afeitada
En el detallado informe de las acusaciones, Kanye habría dicho a los estudiantes que “quería que se afeitaran la cabeza y que tenía la intención de poner una cárcel en la escuela y podrían ser encerrados en jaulas”, dice la demanda.
En ese sentido, el ex colaborador de Donda Academy acusó a Ye de entonar alabanzas de Hitler frente al alumnado a modo de una “retórica peligrosa”. Sin embargo, más allá de la evidente doctrina con tintes nazis, el cantante habría vulnerado a los empleados al mostrarles “fotos desnudas de sus parejas sexuales” y, específicamente a Phillips, poner en riesgo la vida del equipo de trabajo al encargar labores de electricidad y jardinería sin tener experiencia previa en este tipo de actividades.

Amenaza física con testigos
De acuerdo a lo que relata el ex empleado a las autoridades, Kanye lo despedió y volvió a contratar en varias ocasiones. En mayo de 2023, según comparte, el rapero amenazó con pegarle un puñetazo delante de otros trabajadores y alumnos de la escuela. La razón detrás de su enojo era que no le gustaba cómo Trevor Phillips cuidaba de un jardín en Donda Academy.
“Kanye levantó la mano y señaló la condición del cuello de Phillips y gritó: ‘**** ¡tu cuello!’”, se expone en la demanda. “Luego, señalando a la escuela, Kanye eructó: ‘Y **** a tu hija. Me importa un **** todo eso’”. Los improperios no han sido específicados en el reporte original de USA Today. Lo que pide Phillips como indemnización es un monto superior a los USD 35 mil dólares por daños y perjuicios.

Kanye West’s Lawsuit: Everything We Know About the Claims,"Kanye “Ye” West is being sued by a former Yeezy and Donda Academy employee named Trevor Phillips. In his lawsuit, Phillips alleged that he was subjected to a hostile and discriminatory workplace by West after he began working for the rapper in late 2022.
Learn more about West’s lawsuit below.
Why Is Kanye West Being Sued?
Phillips accused West of discrimination and harassment while working at his school. According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly, Phillips’ attorney explained why his client wanted to work for West. After the “Jesus Walks” rapper created his Donda Academy, Phillips saw it as a positive career move for himself having worked at Yeezy.
“Kanye represented the possibilities of what a Black man could accomplish in America: achievement, recognition and financial freedom — truly, the American Dream,” Phillips’ legal team said in the paperwork. “With this in mind, Phillips passionately dove into his work.”
Phillips’ lawyers argued that West was racist to his Black staff rather than his white staff. Moreover, Phillips alleged that he witnessed West convey “discriminatory conspiracy [theories] of Jews” during meetings at his Donda Academy.
“It was immediately apparent to him, and others, that Kanye treated the Black staff considerably worse than white employees,” the court documents read, per the outlet. “Even when class was in session, Kanye would scream and berate Black employees, while never even as much raising his tone at the white staff. Often, Kanye targeted Phillips — a Black man — not just with this disparate and harassing behavior, but complete and utter disdain.”
Phillips worked at Donda Academy for nine months.
At one point, Phillips claimed that West told students at his school that they should shave their heads and that he wanted to put a jail in the school. West also allegedly told the kids they could be locked up in cages.
Phillips’ lawyer, Carney R Shegerian, provided a statement to the outlet, explaining why the former Donda Academy staff member is suing West.
“By filing this lawsuit, we hope our injured clients’ rights are vindicated, and that the famous artist Mr. West understands that his messages — which we alleged preach discrimination, antisemitism and Hitler-love — have no place in the world,” the attorney said.
Has Kanye West Commented on the Lawsuit?
Since Phillips filed the lawsuit against West on April 2, 2024, the “Stronger” artist has not publicly commented on the situation. This is an ongoing case.",2024-04-03T17:10:18Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
The Latest Kanye West Filings Reveal Rapper Allegedly Wanted A Jail At Donda Academy: ‘They Could Be Locked In Cages’,"Kanye West (who’s now formerly known as Ye) has engaged in a number of different business ventures outside of music over the years. While some have proven to be lucrative for the media and fashion mogul, others have earned him backlash. Among the latter is West’s Donda Academy, a private school he opened in California in 2022. The unaccredited institution drew the ire of many upon its opening and eventually became subject to various lawsuits. Now, an ex-employee has also taken legal action against the rapper over the school, and the suit makes a number of claims, including the accusation that West wanted a jail of sorts at the school.
What Does The Latest Suit Regarding Donda Academy Entail?
Trevor Phillips, who reportedly worked for both the Yeezy brand and Donda Academy, filed the lawsuit this week. After having worked with the former entity, Phillips apparently believed that he had a prime opportunity to expand his professional horizons once the school opened. Us Weekly obtained court documents, in which his legal team conveyed that their client viewed Ye as “the American Dream” in some respects. With that, “Phillips passionately dove into his work.” However, during his nine-month stint at the school, the man allegedly endured a hostile work environment, where the “Jesus Walks” rapper would spread “dangerous rhetoric.”
In the suit, it’s also claimed that Kanye West conveyed to students that he “wanted them to shave their heads and that he intended to put a jail at the school — and that they could be locked in cages.” Per the documents, employees ultimately diverted the students’ attention and removed them from the room. It’s worth noting that the four kids Ye shares with Kim Kardashian, whom he’s settled his divorce from, did not attend the institution.
According to Trevor Phillips and his team, the entertainer also told kids of his desire to only date white women. Additionally, the plaintiff also alleged that Black employees were treated poorly compared to their white peers. One portion of the suit reads as follows:
It was immediately apparent to him, and others, that Kanye treated the Black staff considerably worse than white employees. Even when class was in session, Kanye would scream and berate Black employees, while never even as much raising his tone at the white staff. Often, Kanye targeted Phillips — a Black man — not just with this disparate and harassing behavior, but complete and utter disdain.
Other claims include Ye’s reported tendency to share “discriminatory conspiracy of Jews” and an instance in which he reportedly went on about Adolf Hitler’s merits. Purported temper tantrums on the artist’s part are also mentioned in the suit. On the whole, Trevor Phillips is looking for $35,000 in damages for discrimination based on race, a hostile workplace, whistleblower retaliation (as he refers to it) and more.
What Other Claims Have Been Leveled Against Donda Academy In Court?

In April 2023, two former employees of Donda filed a suit against Kanye West and the school, dropping a plethora of accusations. Not only did they allege that $10K was spent on sushi per week, but they also alleged that forks, chairs and second floors were banned. The filing also made note of an alleged all-black dress code and a lack of lesson plans and disciplinary regulations. Another suit was filed in July of that same year, and it claimed that the building was missing windows and that exposed wires led to a fire on the grounds.
The current operating status of the school is unclear. Kanye West reportedly shut the school down in August 2023, with the aim to rebrand it. (That’s also when Trevor Phillips reportedly worked his last day.) All of that arrived months after West came under fire for sharing anti-Semitic comments that got him dropped by Adidas, CAA and more brands. The star addressed his losses, saying that he’d been “beat to a pulp.” At present, he’s also facing a copyright case involving Ozzy Osbourne for reportedly sampling his music without permission. As of right now, neither Ye nor his legal team have issued a statement on this latest legal matter involving Donda Academy.",2024-04-03T15:16:03Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Antisemitismus: US-Justiz nimmt Rapper Kanye West ins Visier,"Der umstrittene US-Rapper Kanye West ist wegen erneuter antisemitischer und Hitler verherrlichender Äußerungen ins Visier der US-Justiz geraten. „Die Juden sind hinter mir her“ und „Die Juden wollen mein Geld“, habe West zu Angestellten gesagt. Das geht aus der Klage seines ehemaligen Angestellten Trevor Phillips hervor, die dieser am Dienstag in Kalifornien eingereicht hat.
Kanye West soll offen über psychische Probleme und krude Hitler-Verehrung gesprochen haben
Bei einem Essen in einem teuren Restaurant habe der Rapper, der in der Vergangenheit offen über seine psychischen Probleme gesprochen hat, Adolf Hitler als „großartig“ bezeichnet. „Er hat so viel erfunden. Ihm haben wir es zu verdanken, dass wir Autos haben“, soll West gesagt haben, möglicherweise ein Anklang an die Legende, Hitler habe die Autobahnen erfunden. Tatsächlich stammten die meisten Plänen zum Bau der Autobahnen aus der Weimarer Zeit.
Phillips beschrieb außerdem, dass West ausschließlich schwarze Mitarbeiter regelmäßig angebrüllt habe. „Kanye hat seinen Angestellten auch verboten, fett zu sein“, heißt es in der Anklageschrift. Zwei Kinder in einer von ihm gegründeten Schule habe er aufgefordert, sich den Kopf zu rasieren, und ihnen gedroht, sie in Käfige zu sperren.
US-Justiz nimmt Rapper Kanye West ins Visier
Phillips, der knapp ein Jahr lang für Wests Modemarke und eine von ihm gegründete Schule gearbeitet hatte, verlangt 35.000 Dollar (32.500 Euro) Schadenersatz. „Wir hoffen, (...) dass West versteht, dass seine Botschaften, die unserer Ansicht nach Diskriminierung, Antisemitismus und die Liebe zu Hitler predigen, keinen Platz auf der Welt haben“, betonte seine Anwältin Carney Shegerian.
Kanye West hatte sich Ende vergangenen Jahres - kurz vor Erscheinen seines neuen Album - für antisemitische Äußerungen der Vergangenheit entschuldigt. Er wolle aus dieser Erfahrung „lernen“ und künftig sensibler und verständnisvoller sein, schrieb der Rapper, der sich in Ye umbenannt hat, auf Hebräisch auf der Onlineplattform Instagram.

"Kanye West, demandado por un exempleado de su Donda Academy por elogiar a Hitler y querer meter a los niños ""en jaulas""","Trevor Phillips, un exempleado de la Donda Academy de Kanye West, ha presentado los documentos necesarios para hacer oficial su demanda contra el rapero por sus políticas dentro de la escuela, donde asegura que llegó a tener un extraño plan para el futuro de los menores, inculcándoles una retórica antisemita.
Phillips explica que se incorporó al equipo de trabajo del músico de 46 años a finales de 2022, justo cuando las controvertidas polémicas sobre los comentarios de Ye contra los judíos, las mujeres e incluso las personas racializadas alcanzaron su punto máximo, siendo defendido por la ideología ultraderechista estadounidense.
Sin embargo, según explica Phillips en los documentos obtenidos por varios medios norteamericanos y que se alargan durante 47 páginas, la primera tarea que se le asignó fue la de aumentar la producción de algodón para la marca de moda de Kanye. Y, poco a poco, sus encargos dentro del organigrama comenzaron a abrirse rápidamente a otros campos.
Como resultado, en un momento dado le asignaron la dirección de la Donda Academy, que en aquel momento sufría las consecuencias de las salidas de tono públicas del rapero. Pero el problema surgió cuando estas declaraciones las comenzó a hacer al personal y a los estudiantes.
Phillips, afroamericano, afirma en la demanda que llegó a sufrir ""una grave discriminación, acoso y represalias directamente de Kanye West"", de quien asegura además haber presenciado además ataques homofóbicos y antisemitas a otras personas.
Entre otras cosas, el extrabajador detalla que fue testigo directo de cómo Ye, en innumerables ocasiones, profería gritos frenéticos a personas negras o que ""predicaba a su personal obscenidades como 'los judíos quieren acabar conmigo' y 'los judíos son unos codiciosos"".
También explica cómo Kanye le hablaba no pocas veces de su adicción a la pornografía, asegurándole que solía tener orgías todos los días, pero que en esos momentos estaba más centrado en la masturbación. Durante uno de esos encuentros, amenazó con atacar a homosexuales, explicando que no eran ""verdaderos cristianos"". ""Bill Gates controla a los homosexuales para que no tengan niños por todo el tema del control de la población"", afirma el demandante que fueron sus palabras.
En una cena que tuvo lugar en un restaurante de lujo en Los Ángeles, rememora Phillips en la denuncia, Kanye habría llegado a elogiar a Adolf Hitler abiertamente, diciendo de él que era ""una buena persona"". ""Hitler era estupendo. ¡Un innovador! Inventó tantas cosas. Por él es que tenemos nuestros coches"", son palabras que el demandante atribuye al rapero. La demanda incluye capturas de pantalla en donde West asegura que él mismo se encuentra ""al nivel de Hitler"".
Según el exempleado, Kanye, delante de dos menores, anunció que quería ""afeitarles la cabeza"" y que tenía intención de construir ""una cárcel"" dentro de la escuela para poder meterlos ""en jaulas"". En otra ocasión advirtió a sus empleados de que no podían estar gordos o serían inmediatamente despedidos.

Kanye West accusé de racisme et d'antisémitisme par un ex-employé,"L'artiste américain, qui se dit bipolaire et ne cache pas son admiration pour Hitler, a tenu à maintes reprises des propos racistes et antisémites, selon la plainte déposée par Trevor Phillips, un Afro-Américain, employé par sa marque Yeezy et son école Donda Academy.
Le rappeur controversé Kanye West a hurlé à plusieurs reprises sur des employés noirs et a fait l'éloge d'Adolf Hitler en tant qu' ""innovateur"", selon une nouvelle plainte déposée en Californie mardi 2 avril. L'artiste, également connu pour sa marque de mode Yeezy, est devenu un paria du show-business depuis qu'il a multiplié les propos antisémites en 2022 et affiché sa sympathie pour le dictateur nazi.
Cette plainte, dans laquelle un ex-employé affirme que le chanteur a assuré à des écoliers qu'il était persécuté par le peuple juif, ternit encore davantage l'image de l'artiste, qui dit souffrir de troubles bipolaires. Elle a été déposée par Trevor Phillips, un Afro-Américain qui a travaillé pendant près d'un an pour Yeezy et pour la Donda Academy, une école fondée par le rappeur controversé.
Des ""hurlements frénétiques""
Embauché fin 2022, l'ex-salarié affirme n'avoir ""jamais vu M. West hurler et réprimander une personne blanche"", selon la plainte. ""Mais à d'innombrables reprises, il a vu et/ou subi personnellement les hurlements frénétiques de Kanye sur des personnes noires."" Selon Trevor Phillips, le rappeur s'est lancé à plusieurs reprises dans des tirades antisémites devant son personnel, en assurant que ""les juifs veulent (l)e faire tomber"" ou que ""les Juifs volent tout (s)on argent"".
De nombreuses marques, comme Adidas, Gap et Balenciaga, ont coupé les ponts avec Kanye West, à cause de précédentes déclarations antisémites. Selon la plainte, l'artiste, également connu sous le nom de Ye, a fait l'éloge d'Hitler lors d'un dîner dans un restaurant huppé de Los Angeles.
""Hitler était fabuleux"", a estimé le rappeur, d'après la plainte. ""Hitler était un innovateur. Il a inventé tant de choses. C'est grâce à lui que nous avons des voitures"", a-t-il ajouté, en assénant une contre-vérité historique. Les ingénieurs allemands Karl Benz et Gottlieb Daimler font partie des personnes à l'origine du développement de l'automobile. Le dictateur nazi s'est contenté de soutenir Ferdinand Porsche, qui a dessiné et produit en masse la célèbre Coccinelle de Volkswagen.
Comportement et propos déplacés
Dans sa plainte, Trevor Phillips affirme par ailleurs que lors d'une conversation avec deux enfants de la Donda Academy, le rappeur leur a dit de se raser la tête et a menacé de les enfermer dans des cages. ""Kanye a également dit aux employés (...) qu'aucun d'entre eux ne devait être gros, sinon il les licencierait"", ajoute la plainte. La Donda Academy est déjà au centre de plusieurs plaintes déposées par d'anciens enseignants, licenciés après avoir émis des réserves sur la sécurité et l'environnement toxique qu'elle réserve à ses écoliers.
Trevor Phillips réclame 35 000 dollars de dommages et intérêts, et souhaite faire passer un message avec sa plainte. ""Nous espérons que (...) M.

Das geht aus der Klage seines ehemaligen Angestellten Trevor Phillips hervor, die dieser am Dienstag in Kalifornien eingereicht hat.
Bei einem Essen in einem teuren Restaurant habe der Rapper, der in der Vergangenheit offen über seine psychischen Probleme gesprochen hat, Adolf Hitler als «grossartig» bezeichnet. «Er hat so viel erfunden. Ihm haben wir es zu verdanken, dass wir Autos haben», soll West gesagt haben, möglicherweise ein Anklang an die Legende, Hitler habe die Autobahnen erfunden.

Zwei Kinder in einer von ihm gegründeten Schule habe er aufgefordert, sich den Kopf zu rasieren, und ihnen gedroht, sie in Käfige zu sperren.
Phillips, der knapp ein Jahr lang für Wests Modemarke und eine von ihm gegründete Schule gearbeitet hatte, verlangt 35.000 Dollar (32.500 Euro) Schadenersatz. «Wir hoffen, (...) dass West versteht, dass seine Botschaften, die unserer Ansicht nach Diskriminierung, Antisemitismus und die Liebe zu Hitler predigen, keinen Platz auf der Welt haben», betonte seine Anwältin Carney Shegerian.
Kanye West hatte sich Ende vergangenen Jahres – kurz vor Erscheinen seines neuen Album – für antisemitische Äusserungen der Vergangenheit entschuldigt.

"Kanye West acusado de racismo, antissemitismo, homofobia e ""amor a Hitler"" em novo processo","Trevor Phillips, que é negro e trabalhou para duas empresas de West durante quase um ano, alega na ação que ""sofreu severa discriminação, assédio e retaliação diretamente de Kanye West"".
O homem afirma que ""em inúmeras ocasiões viu ou experienciou pessoalmente os gritos frenéticos de Kanye com pessoas negras"".
Phillips foi contratado em novembro de 2022 pela Yeezy, a marca de roupas do controverso rapper, e depois começou a trabalhar também na sua escola, a Donda Academy.
No processo, ele diz ter testemunhado, ainda, ataques homofóbicos e antissemitas do cantor, que é objeto de outro processo por comportamentos arbitrários na sua escola, e que desencadeou críticas por repetidos comentários contra judeus que custaram parcerias comerciais milionárias com marcas como Adidas e GAP.
""Phillips, em várias ocasiões, testemunhou como Kanye pregava obscenidades junto do seu pessoal, como 'os judeus querem acabar comigo' e 'os judeus roubam todo o meu dinheiro'"", indica o documento legal.
De acordo com a ação, num jantar organizado num luxuoso restaurante em Los Angeles, West terá elogiado o líder nazi Adolf Hitler, chamando-o ""boa pessoa"". ""Hitler foi genial. Hitler foi um inovador! Ele inventou tantas coisas"", teria dito o artista.
O ex-funcionário também acusa o rapper de 46 anos, que mudou o seu nome para Ye, de usar uma ""retórica perigosa"" na frente dos alunos da Donda Academy.
Ele conta que, numa conversa com dois alunos, ""Kanye disse-lhes que queria que rapassem as suas cabeças e que tinha a intenção de colocar uma prisão na escola, e que poderia trancá-los em jaulas"".
Relata ainda que Ye alertou numa reunião que os seus funcionários não podiam ser gordos, sob pena de serem demitidos.
""Ao apresentar este processo, esperamos que os direitos dos nossos clientes prejudicados sejam reivindicados, e que o famoso artista Sr. West compreenda que as suas mensagens, que, segundo alegamos, pregam discriminação, antissemitismo e amor a Hitler, não têm lugar no mundo"", disse em comunicado o advogado Carney R. Shegerian, responsável pelo processo.

A former Donda Academy and Yeezy employee claims the rapper compared himself to Adolf Hitler and said he wanted to shave students' heads and lock them in cages.
LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A former employee of Kanye West's Donda Academy private school claims the rapper spread antisemitic conspiracy theories in front of staff and students.
Trevor Phillips, who also previously worked for West's fashion brand Yeezy, filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying he suffered ""severe discrimination, harassment, and retaliation"" by West, who now goes by Ye.
Phillips accuses West of comparing himself to Adolf Hitler, saying he wanted to shave students' heads and lock them in cages.
The lawsuit also spells out alleged threats of physical violence, inappropriate sexual behavior, and anti-LGBTQ comments.
""By filing this lawsuit, we hope our injured clients' rights are vindicated, and that the famous artist Mr. West understands that his messages - which we alleged preach discrimination, antisemitism and Hitler-love - have no place in the world,"" said attorney Carney R. Shegerian.
The legal action is the latest in a slew of discrimination and wrongful termination lawsuits filed by former employees of West and his school.
Last April, two former teachers filed a lawsuit, claiming they were wrongfully terminated from Donda Academy.
Then in June, a photographer sued West for assault, battery, and negligence over an incident that happened in Newbury Park. She claims she was filming West interacting with another photographer when he came over to her car, and grabbed her phone and threw it.

Ex-Donda Academy Employee Sues for Discrimination,"Kanye West is facing another lawsuit filed by a former employee at his Donda Academy, this time accusing him of discriminating against Black staffers and seeking to lock students in cages.
In a lawsuit filed Tuesday (April 2) in Los Angeles court, Trevor Phillips says the embattled rapper (who now goes by Ye) treated the Black staff at the school “considerably worse than white employees” — and then subjected him to “incessant harassment” and “humiliation” when he spoke up about it.
Like the several other lawsuits filed by former Donda Academy employees, the new complaint includes a number of bizarre allegations about West and his conduct at the school. It claims he told students to “shave their heads” and that he “intended to put a jail at the school” where students could be “locked in cages.”

In another odd alleged episode, Phillips claims West summoned him to a room at the Nobu Hotel, where the rapper put on The Batman and watched it in silence.
“After a long and awkward silence, Kanye finally spoke again,” Phillips claims in the suit. “Turning his attention back to Phillips, he began an unprovoked and bigoted rant attacking Jewish people.” Later that same evening, Phillips claims West lay on the bed and simulated masturbating while talking about having orgies.
Phillips claims he was finally fired last year.
The case is the latest lawsuit filed by former staffers of Donda Academy and the Yeezy Christian Academy that preceded it. One of them, filed in July, claimed that the school lacked windows because the embattled rapper “did not like glass” and that students were not allowed on the second floor because West was “reportedly afraid of stairs.” Another case, filed in April 2023, alleged that the only food available to students was sushi.
As with those earlier cases, the strange allegations contained in Tuesday’s lawsuit supported more straightforward legal claims, including discrimination, harassment, retaliation and wrongful termination.

Phillips, who is Black, claims that from the outset of his employment at Donda Academy, it was evident that Ye treated Black staff significantly worse than their white counterparts. He alleges instances of verbal abuse, with West reportedly screaming and berating Black employees while showing preferential treatment to white staff members. Phillips even stated that Ye openly expressed his preference for solely dating white women.
Threats Of Violence & Retaliation

Perhaps the most alarming accusations in Phillips' lawsuit revolve around threats of physical violence and whistleblower retaliation. According to the complaint, Phillips faced relentless harassment and humiliation from West after pushing back against what he describes as the artist's bigotry and unlawful directives. Phillips recounts instances where West allegedly threatened him with physical harm and subjected him to vulgar tirades in front of colleagues and schoolchildren.

Throughout the lawsuit, Phillips highlights numerous instances of concerning behavior exhibited by Kanye West. These include allegations of antisemitism, with West purportedly praising Adolf Hitler (“HITLER WAS GREAT. Hitler was an innovator! He invented so many things. He’s the reason we have cars,” Ye allegedly said, according to the lawsuit) and espousing conspiracy theories about Jewish people and the LGBTQ+ community. “I am going for the Gays! First the Jews, then the Gays. … Gay people are not true Christians. And Gay people are controlled by Bill Gates so that they don’t have children for population control,” Phillips alleged Ye to have said, according to LA Times. Phillips also claims that Ye made inappropriate remarks in front of Donda Academy students, creating an uncomfortable and potentially harmful environment.
Unsafe Working Conditions & Unlawful Directives

Beyond the allegations of discrimination and harassment, Phillips describes being tasked with dangerous electrical work and renovations at Donda Academy without proper permits or construction experience. He asserts that West's disregard for safety regulations put employees at risk and further contributed to a hostile work environment. Additionally, Phillips asserts that he overheard West expressing a desire to shave childrens heads. “He wanted them to shave their heads and that he intended to put a jail at the school — and that they could be locked in cages,” Phillips added in the suit.

Legal Ramifications & Seeking Justice
Phillips is seeking damages in excess of $35,000 for what he alleges to be whistleblower retaliation, discrimination based on race, and a hostile workplace, among other causes of action. His lawsuit represents a significant challenge to Kanye West's reputation and business interests, as it sheds light on troubling practices within his organizations.
In response to these allegations, representatives for Kanye West have not provided comment, leaving the veracity of Phillips' claims to be determined through legal proceedings. However, the lawsuit underscores broader concerns about workplace culture and accountability, particularly within high-profile celebrity enterprises like those of Kanye West.

"Ye Praised Hitler and Spoke of ‘Going for the Gays,’ Lawsuit Claims","Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, was sued Tuesday by a former employee who accused him of discrimination and creating a hostile work environment by calling Adolf Hitler “great,” disparaging Jews and saying that “gay people are not true Christians.”
The lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Trevor Phillips, who says he was hired in November 2022, around the time a series of antisemitic remarks publicly made by Ye lost the artist his major-label record deal and put his businesses in jeopardy.
Phillips was initially hired to oversee “projects related to growing cotton” and other plants in an effort to make Yeezy, Ye’s fashion brand, “self-sustainable,” the lawsuit said, and then went on to work for Donda Academy, Ye’s private school in Southern California.
Phillips’s lawsuit claims that Ye made antisemitic comments in front of staff members at Donda Academy, including, “the Jews are out to get me” and “the Jews are stealing all my money.” After Adidas ended its decade-long partnership with Ye over his public remarks, the lawsuit claimed, the rapper told Phillips: “The Jews are working with Adidas to freeze up my money to try and make me broke!”",2024-04-02T21:17:14Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
"Kanye West é acusado de racismo, antissemitismo e homofobia em novo processo","AFPi AFP https://istoe.com.br/autor/afp/ 02/04/2024 - 21:07 Para compartilhar:
O rapper americano Kanye West foi processado por um ex-funcionário que o acusa de racismo, antissemitismo, homofobia e “severa discriminação” em uma nova ação judicial apresentada nesta terça-feira (2) em um tribunal de Los Angeles.
Trevor Phillips, que é negro e trabalhou para duas empresas de West por quase um ano, alega na ação que “sofreu severa discriminação, assédio e retaliação diretamente de Kanye West”.
O homem afirma que “em inúmeras ocasiões viu ou experimentou pessoalmente os gritos frenéticos de Kanye com pessoas negras”.
Phillips foi contratado em novembro de 2022 pela Yeezy, a marca de roupas do controverso rapper, e depois começou a trabalhar também em sua escola, a Donda Academy.
No processo, ele diz ter testemunhado, ainda, ataques homofóbicos e antissemitas do cantor, que é objeto de outro processo por comportamentos arbitrários em sua escola, e que desencadeou críticas por repetidos comentários contra judeus que custaram parcerias comerciais milionárias com marcas como Adidas e GAP.
“Phillips, em várias ocasiões, testemunhou como Kanye pregava obscenidades para seu pessoal, como ‘os judeus querem acabar comigo’ e ‘os judeus roubam todo o meu dinheiro'”, indica o documento legal.
De acordo com a ação, em um jantar em um luxuoso restaurante em Los Angeles, West teria elogiado o líder nazista Adolf Hitler, chamando-o de “boa pessoa”. “Hitler foi genial. Hitler foi um inovador! Ele inventou tantas coisas”, teria dito o artista.
O ex-funcionário também acusa o rapper de 46 anos, que mudou seu nome para Ye, de usar uma “retórica perigosa” na frente dos alunos da Donda Academy.
Ele conta que, em uma conversa com dois alunos, “Kanye disse a eles que queria que raspassem suas cabeças e que tinha a intenção de colocar uma prisão na escola, e que poderia trancá-los em jaulas”.
Relata ainda que Ye alertou em uma reunião que seus funcionários não podiam ser gordos, sob pena de serem demitidos.
“Ao apresentar este processo, esperamos que os direitos de nossos clientes prejudicados sejam reivindicados, e que o famoso artista Sr. West compreenda que suas mensagens, que, segundo alegamos, pregam discriminação, antissemitismo e amor a Hitler, não têm lugar no mundo”, disse em comunicado o advogado Carney R. Shegerian, responsável pelo processo.
Phillips, que deixou de trabalhar para as empresas de West em agosto de 2023, busca uma compensação financeira de 35 mil dólares (177 mil reais) pelos transtornos que afirma ter sofrido.

Kanye sued on claims he wanted to cage Donda Academy students,"The artist formerly known as Kanye West allegedly wanted to shave the heads of students at his cryptic Donda Academy and lock them in cages, according to a new lawsuit against the “Black Skinhead” rapper that also claims he compared himself to Adolf Hitler.
A former employee at the California-based Christian academy founded by Ye in 2022 further alleges Ye spoke well of the Nazi leader and mistreated Black people at his unaccredited school, per court documents obtained by Rolling Stone.
The lawsuit against Ye was filed Tuesday in Los Angeles by Trevor Phillips, who was hired by the 46-year-old rapper in November 2022. Phillips worked for him until last August, when he claims he was fired amid one of Ye’s “temper tantrums,” in which he insulted Phillips and his daughter, who was a Donda Academy student.
Phillips alleges Ye in a text message compared himself to Hitler “minus the gas chambers,” according to NBC News. During one particular meeting, Phillips says Ye went on a rant about how the Holocaust was fake, and said “gay people are not true Christians.”
Among other things, the suit also claims Ye warned employees they could be fired for being “fat,” and stiffed workers out of pay after Adidas cut ties with the rapper over his antisemitic comments.
Ye’s attorneys have not publicly addressed the allegations in Phillips’ suit.
Donda Academy was named in honor of Ye’s mother, Donda West, who died in 2007 from complications connected to cosmetic surgery.
Amid the controversy surrounding Ye’s antisemitic rhetoric, the academy said it was suspending operations in October 2022 before announcing mere hours later it would remain open.
While the school’s current status is unclear, The U.S. Sun reported last month that Ye was rebranding the school as Donda Ray Academy and focusing its curriculum on basketball, choir and dance.

Kanye West é acusado de ameaçar 'enjaular' e 'raspar cabeça' de alunos,"Phillips alega ter sofrido ""discriminação, assédio e retaliação"", e que sua ""conduta inapropriada era incessante"" e ""exibia sua aparente excitação"". O processo pede indenizações superiores da R$ 177 mil, honorários advocatícios e uma liminar que impeça o rapper de abrir qualquer tipo de centro de ensino para crianças menores de 18 anos na Califórnia.
Segundo a ação, Trevor narra um jantar com Kanye em 2022, onde ele criticou o povo judeu, os descreveu como ""avarentos"" e elogiou Adolf Hitler por ser ""inovador"", além de afimar que o Holocausto era ""falso"".
""O que era para ser uma reunião com seu chefe sobre a Donda Academy, acabou sendo um monólogo antissemita e preconceituoso, culminado com assédio sexual"", descreve o processo. Ainda no mesmo jantar, West supostamente teria feito comentários hostis e ameaçado a comunidade LGBTQIAP+, além de dizer que Bill Gates ""controla"" os homossexuais.
Phillips, um homem negro, alega que Ye ""tratava os funcionários negros visivelmente pior do que funcionários brancos"" e ordenou que um segurança que tinha dreads que ""raspasse"" ou seria demitido, o que levou o guarda a renunciar o cargo.
Em um comunicado do advogado da vítima para o Page Six nesta terça-feira (02), a ação deseja que os direitos feridos de Trevor sejam justificados que o ""Sr. West entenda que suas mensagens - que alegamos pregar discriminação, antissemitismo e amor a Hitler - não tem lugar no mundo"".",2024-04-02T20:21:56Z,https://www.uol.com.br,UOL
"Kanye West : addiction au porno, propos antisémites… le rappeur a atteint un point de non-retour","Le rappeur Kanye West est au cœur de nombreuses polémiques. Il y a quelques mois, l’artiste s’était excusé, auprès de la communauté juive, un an après avoir tenu des propos antisémites qui avaient provoqué l’indignation.""Je m’excuse sincèrement auprès de la communauté juive pour toute indignation provoquée par mes mots ou mes gestes. Ce n’était pas mon intention de choquer ou de manquer de respect et je regrette vraiment toute douleur que j’aurais pu provoquer"", est-il écrit, en hébreu, sur son compte Instagram.
Mais il semblerait que Kanye West soit encore de la tourmente. L'ex de Kim Kardashian vient d’être attaqué en justice par un ancien employé. Trevor Philips a révélé que le rappeur avait des projets bizarres pour les enfants qui fréquentaient sa Donda Acandemy. Il a également révélé qu'il avait prononcé une rhétorique antisémite à l'école.
Les révélations de l'employé de Kanye West
Selon ses dires, l’homme avait été embauché à la fin de 2022. C'était au moment où la controverse sur l'antisémitisme de Kanye West a atteint son apogée. À cette époque, il explique qu'il a été chargé de la production pour la ligne de mode du rappeur. Cependant, selon les documents obtenus par TMZ, Trevor Phillips affirme que ses fonctions se sont rapidement élargies. Il a commencé à gérer la gestion de l'école Donda Academy en Californie.
Trevor Phillips a assuré que Kanye partageait fréquemment ses opinions antisémites avec le personnel de la Donda Academy, ainsi qu'avec les élèves. Lors d'une réunion particulière, il a déclaré que le rappeur a tenu des propos antisémites en annonçant, devant deux enfants, qu'il voulait leur raser la tête et qu'il avait l'intention d'installer une prison dans l'école. Il les a ensuite menacé d'être enfermés dans des cages dans le cadre du plan qu'il proposait.
Le rappeur accusé d'intimider les employés
Mais ce n'est pas tout. Trevor Phillips assure également que Kanye West avait l'habitude de réprimander et d'intimider les employés noirs, y compris lui-même, chez Donda.
Enfin, il affirme avoir été licencié par Kanye West sur un coup de tête en mai 2023. Les faits se sont déroulés lors d'un service dominical. Toujours selon TMZ, il assure avoir appris plus tard qu'il avait été renvoyé parce que Kanye n'aimait pas le jardin exposé pendant le service.

Kanye West allegedly threatened to shave the heads of Donda Academy students and even lock them in cages, a new lawsuit claims.
In a lawsuit obtained by Page Six Tuesday, former Yeezy employee Trevor Phillips claimed he suffered “severe discrimination, harassment, and retaliation” from West while working for his design company. However, his duties eventually expanded into doing work for his now-shuttered school.
Phillips further claimed that West, 46, would “proudly” tout his antisemitic conspiracies in front of students and even told two children that he “wanted to shave their heads” and “intended to put a jail at the school,” the documents state.

Phillips also alleged that, while at dinner with West at Nobu Malibu in December 2022, the “All of the Lights” rapper lambasted Jewish people again and described them as “miserly” and went so far as to praise Adolf Hitler as “an innovator.” He also allegedly claimed the Holocaust was “fake.”
The former employee also claimed the “Flashing Lights” performer would engage in “incessant inappropriate conduct” and show off his “apparent arousal.”
“What was meant to be a meeting with his boss about Donda Academy, its curriculum and horticulture, ended up being antisemitic and bigoted soliloquy-topped off with sexual harassment,” the lawsuit states.

He also claimed that after the group’s sushi was delivered the fashion designer “began threatening the LGBTQ community.”
“‘Yeah I’m going for the gays! FIRST the Jews, THEN the gays!'” Phillips purports West said, further alleging that Bill Gates “controls” homosexuals.
A black man, Phillips also alleged that West “treated black employees palpably worse than white employees” and claimed he “commanded” a black campus security guard to “shave his dreads” or be fired; the guard ultimately resigned from his role.

“By filing this lawsuit, we hope our injured clients’ rights are vindicated, and that the famous artist Mr. West understands that his messages – which we alleged preach discrimination, antisemitism and Hitler-love – have no place in the world,” Carney R. Shegerian, Phillips’ attorney, tells Page Six in a statement.
Phillips is suing West for discrimination, harassment, a hostile work environment and more. He seeks to be awarded general and special damages exceeding $35,000, attorneys’ fees and wants an injunction preventing West from opening any type of school for kids under 18 in California.

"Ye wanted to put Donda Academy students in cages, lawsuit claims","The artist Ye is accused of spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories in front of the staff and children at his troubled private Christian school during a meeting in which he also allegedly expressed wanting to shave students’ heads and lock them in cages, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday by a former employee.
In a text message to the former employee, Trevor Phillips, Ye compared himself to Hitler — “minus the gas chambers” — and appeared to simulate masturbation during a one-on-one meeting in a Southern California hotel room where the musician watched “The Batman” on mute, according to the 47-page suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court and obtained by NBC News.
The suit accuses Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, of calling out Black people in a discriminatory manner and praising the Nazi leader, pushing employees to do renovations without permits and telling employees they could be fired for being ""fat,"" the suit says. He temporarily stiffed workers after Adidas cut ties with the rapper over his antisemitic comments, when bank accounts at the rapper's clothing brand, Yeezy, had been frozen, the suit says.
Ye “gloated” to staff at Yeezy, his fashion brand, and Donda Academy, the rapper’s Los Angeles-area school, about using $2 million of the school’s budget for a trip to Paris, according to the suit.

During a Sunday service at the school in May, in front of dozens of people, Ye angrily told Phillips he was fired over an apparent issue with a garden at the school, according to the suit.
When a tearful Phillips told Ye that his daughter attended Donda and that he was grateful for the job because of a potentially serious medical condition, Ye allegedly responded with an expletive-laden “tantrum” in which the musician disparaged Phillips and his child, according to the suit.
Ye then allegedly told Phillips: “I was going to punch you in the face.”
Phillips, who was hired in November 2022 to work on a “vertical integrated crew” for the musician’s clothing brand, continued to work for the rapper until August, when Donda shut down, according to the suit.
Tuesday’s complaint, filed by attorney Carney Shegerian, seeks more than $35,000 in damages and alleges discrimination, retaliation, wrongful termination and other claims.
Phillips’ allegations add to a troubled and bizarre portrait of Donda, where former employees have said that students were allowed to eat only sushi for lunch, windows were empty because Ye didn’t like glass, and chairs, artwork and outside books were banned.
The accusations are included in previous lawsuits from three former teachers and an ex-assistant principal who allege discrimination and wrongful termination.
One of the lawsuits has also named Donda's predecessor, Yeezy Christian Academy. A trial in one of the suits is scheduled to begin in April 2025.
A lawyer for the rapper has previously dismissed claims about Donda, saying the former employees' descriptions of the school as a “dystopian institution designed to satisfy Ye’s idiosyncrasies” were false.
“None of it is true and the allegations do a disservice to the Donda Academy’s current staff and students and their parents who will attest to their positive experience,” the lawyer said in a 2023 filing.

Kanye West Accused of Anti-Black Racism in Employee Lawsuit,"A former employee accused Kanye West of anti-Black racism in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, and also claimed that he had witnessed West’s homophobic and antisemitic outbursts.
The employee, Trevor Phillips, who is Black, alleged that West had berated him and humiliated him in front of others, and that several employees noted that West treated Black employees worse than white ones.
“During his tenure, Phillips never witnessed West yell and berate a white person, but on countless occasions he saw and/or personally experienced Kanye frenziedly yell at Black people,” the lawsuit states.
Phillips was hired in November 2022 to work for Yeezy, West’s fashion brand, and also worked at Donda Academy, his private school. According to the complaint, his job included overseeing a project growing cotton and other crops as part of a plan to develop a self-sustaining community.
At the time, West’s career was in free-fall following a series of antisemitic remarks on Twitter and in interviews. Adidas had dropped a lucrative deal with him the previous month. According to the suit, West also engaged in antisemitic tirades during staff meetings at Donda Academy, including once in the presence of two children.
Phillips was present when West said things like “the Jews are out to get me” and “the Jews are stealing all my money,” the suit alleges. He also told the two children present at a meeting that he wanted to shave their heads, and that he planned to build a jail at the school, and the children could be locked in cages, the suit alleges.
Shortly after Phillips was hired, West invited him to a meeting at the Nobu hotel in Malibu, where West allegedly praised Hitler and said he hated Jewish people, according to the suit. He also stated that the “Jews are working with Adidas to freeze up my money,” the suit alleges.
According to the complaint, West demanded that the hotel staff put on “The Batman,” starring Robert Pattinson and Zoë Kravitz, and that he and Phillips watched the movie with the volume turned to zero. The suit states that West lay flat on his back on the bed and mimicked masturbating while the movie was playing, and talked about having orgies.
The suit also quotes West as attacking gay people during the meeting, saying that they are “controlled by Bill Gates so they don’t have children for population control.”
The suit recounts other alleged discriminatory behavior over the ensuing weeks, including a claim that West ordered a Black security guard to shave his dreadlocks or be fired.
Phillips alleges in May 2023, West publicly humiliated him during a “Sunday service” at Donda Academy, which is described as a “pseudo-religious sermon where Kanye and a choir plays gospel music.” According to the suit, West singled out Phillips and shouted at him — with more than 100 people looking on — that he was “fucking fired,” and that he should “get the fuck out of here.”
West appeared to be dissatisfied with the school’s garden, and Phillips sought to explain that he was not responsible for it. Phillips spoke with West, telling him, as tears streamed down his face, that he was grateful for the opportunity to work for him, the suit states. West responded by cursing at him and throwing a temper tantrum, during which he uprooted some of the plants.
West also threatened to punch Phillips in the face, the lawsuit states. He then had an apparent change of heart. Punching one fist in the air in imitation of Mario’s celebratory dance in the Mario Bros. video game, West said that he would give Phillips “one more chance.”
He then directed him to drive to a farm in Fillmore, Calif., talk to the owner, and report back to West with a recommendation about whether or not to buy it, according to the suit.
Phillips’ went home and broke down crying, according to the suit.
“His dream of working for someone he once admired was like his spirit — crushed,” the suit states. “While Kanye considered himself a god or a king, in reality he was an ill-tempered tyrant and despot, who sought to mentally obliterate and control those around him.”
Phillips went to the farm later that day, toured it, and gave West his impressions. West said he would buy it and put Phillips in charge, the lawsuit states. However, the following day, West texted him: “You still fired. You not on the level.”
Donda Academy has since shut down, though there has been talk of reopening it. The lawsuit seeks an injunction barring West from owning and operating a school.
The suit also states claims of race discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination.",2024-04-02T15:06:09Z,https://variety.com,Variety

After introducing herself and gushing about how “excited” she felt about the opportunity, Censori spoke about her “ideology.”
She sported a longer hairstyle on the Zoom call than the shorter chop she’s rocked in recent months.
While her outfit was out of frame, Censori’s blue choker necklace could be seen before she shared her screen.

She began with a quote from poet Alberto Caeiro, which read, “To eat a fruit is to know its meaning.”
Censori said, “As designers and architects, we are incessantly chasing the paradigm shift. We talk about it, we design it, we manifest it. But design in its essence will never be encapsulated by a single aesthetic movement. It is pure nature.
“We believe the paradigm shift lies in humanizing design. The ability to recognize what it is truly to be a human being living in within a built environment. Understanding the needs we have as a collective and designing for that in the most simplistic and functional way.”

Kanye West: Warum hat er sein Instagram gelöscht?,"Der Rapper Kanye West möchte mit seinem neuen und mittlerweile auch offiziellen Namen angesprochen werden: Ye. Hat er jetzt aus Trotz sein Instagram-Profil gelöscht? Oder steckt etwas anderes dahinter?

US-Medien spekulieren, dass er sich darüber ärgert, dass seine Fans seinen neuen Namen «Ye» nicht akzeptieren.
Alle Fans des streitbaren Rappers Kanye West (46) schauen aktuell bei Instagram in die Röhre: Der Musiker hat seinen offiziellen Account deaktiviert und lässt somit seine rund 20 Millionen Follower derzeit alleine. Zumindest ist das ein möglicher Grund für das Verschwinden seiner Seite. US-Medien spekulieren, dass er sich darüber ärgert, dass seine Fans seinen neuen Namen «Ye» nicht akzeptieren. Diesen hatte er sich im Oktober 2021 auch gerichtlich als offiziellen Namen eintragen lassen. Vor rund einem Monat regte er sich noch in einem Post darüber auf, dass ihn zu wenige als Ye respektieren würden.
Damals monierte er, dass ihn kaum jemand als Ye ansprechen würde und er teilweise auch dazu gezwungen würde, seinen Geburtsnamen Kanye West zu benutzen – unter anderem von Instagram. Zu diesem Gefühlsausbruch postete er ausserdem einen Screenshot einer Nachricht an Influencer Justin Laboy, in dem er schrieb: «Ich schliesse meinen Kanye-West-Instagram-Account.» Ein entsprechender Ersatz-Account, der auf den Namen Ye hört, ist bislang allerdings noch nicht aufgetaucht.

Ausserdem meinte Kanye West: «Mein Name ist Ye.» Niemand könne ihn zwingen, sich mit seinem alten Namen zu bezeichnen. Sein alter Name werde in Kürze auch auf Instagram in Ye geändert. Doch scheinbar ist dies nicht passiert. Ist die Deaktivierung also eine schlichte Trotzreaktion von Ye bzw. Kanye West?
Eine andere Möglichkeit wäre, dass der Meta-Konzern, zu dem Instagram gehört, die Seite aufgrund seiner Inhalte vorübergehend sperren liess. Ye postete bereits in der Vergangenheit zahlreiche kontroverse Statements, teilweise verharmloste er auch Adolf Hitler oder relativierte den Holocaust. Für einige Experten scheint dieser Grund der wahrscheinlichere zu sein: Bei einem vorübergehenden Sperren von Instagram selbst kann man die Seite noch aufrufen, es wird aber angezeigt, dass sie aktuell nicht erreichbar wäre. Das ist der aktuelle Stand. Hätte Ye seinen Instagram-Account selbst komplett gelöscht, wäre dies nicht der Fall und der Seitenaufruf ginge ins Leere.

Kanye West ha cancellato il secondo round di ascolti nelle arene di Vultures,"I fan di Kanye West che speravano di poter ascoltare in un'arena le tracce di Vultures sono rimasti a bocca asciutta. Il secondo ciclo di sessioni dal vivo, infatti, è stato annullato. E, ad annunciarlo, sono state le stesse arene in cui i concerti erano in programma.
La cancellazione a sorpresa
Kanye West e Ty Dolla Sign avrebbero dovuto esibirsi a Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Pittsburgh, Nashville, Charlotte e Washington DC. Ma, i concerti, sono stati cancellati poco dopo il loro annuncio. Kanye West, che ora si fa chiamare Ye, non ha dato spiegazioni. Anzi, lo scorso fine settimana ha cancellato il suo account Instagram (o almeno così sembra, trattandosi di uno tra gli artisti più imprevedibili di sempre). Le cancellazioni dello show seguono i feedback negativi sul concerto di apertura di Ye e Ty al Rolling Loud Festival di Inglewood, in California. I due artisti avevano promesso di svelare in anteprima del nuovo materiale, ma si sono limitati ad eseguire alcuni dei brani contenuti in Vultures 1 disattendendo le aspettative.",2024-04-02T12:11:47Z,https://tg24.sky.it,Sky Tg24

Bianca Censori Looks 'Overly Uncomfortable' in Easter Outing with Kanye West and His Kids: Expert,"All didn't seem well with Bianca Censori's expressions during the Easter weekend she spent with her husband Kanye West and his four kids: 10-year-old North, 8-year-old Saint, 6-year-old Chicago, and 4-year-old Psalm. Apparently, the couple treated their little ones to a meal at Nobu in Malibu, where the architect seemed disconnected from the rest.

In a rarity, the 29-year-old was covered up from head to toe in a skintight greyish-silver jumpsuit and wore silver strappy heels. She tied her hair in a tight, sleek bun with little to no makeup look. She crossed her arms in front and held her phone in one hand while walking ahead of her husband. Meanwhile, Ye was in his signature all-black look.

According to the body language expert Judi James, the Australian wasn't 'overly comfortable' during her outing. She told The Mirror, ""There's clearly no Easter respite for Bianca in terms of just relaxing in a pair of cargo jeans and enjoying her time with her blended family like Kanye is in his super-comfy baggy wear.""
She further highlighted, ""Her silver Star Trek-themed onesie here might be more demure in terms of denier than her usual sheer choices but it looks like the ultimate in discomfort for a fun day out and it singles Bianca out in terms of integrating uniform-wise with Kanye and his children."" Censori's unreasonably bold and bizarre outfit choices have sent shockwaves from time to time. Her near-naked looks have often been blamed on West. In fact, several reports have suggested the Yeezy owner 'manipulates' his young wife into wearing questionable clothes.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bianca Censori - West (@biancasensorii)
However, one source suggests it's the opposite. ""People are confusing Bianca's creativity,"" the insider claimed. ""She is a phenomenal personality, a phenomenal actor, who can entertain the public. She's a performance artist. Bianca is as much a performer as Ye is,"" per Page Six. But the body language guru insists otherwise; she reiterated the outfits worn by Censori were less 'creative' and more 'complicated.' James criticized, ""Even a trip to the loo could turn into an epic, Houdini-style struggle in an outfit like this.""
Meanwhile, the expert said that Yeezy designer walking ahead of the family signals a detachment. ""Walking ahead of the group adds to this suggestion of being singled out. It makes her look like the publicity stunt rather than the cool step-mom."" She didn't stop there because she added, ""While the others walk hand-in-hand with their heads down Bianca is her usual upright, overly-visible self. The one walking ahead of a family group can often look like the leader but, with her phone in one hand, Bianca's positioning makes her look more like a PR going ahead of her celebrities.""

Although this isn't the first time Censori is spotted with West and his children. In fact, she seems to have bonded really well with the eldest North who is often seen at her father's music launches, most recent being the Vultures listening party. However, James argued this outing wasn't the same as the previous ones. ""Some of Bianca's family outings have revealed some very sweet, fun, and close bonds with Kanye's children, especially when she is dressed in a similar way, but here she's back into what looks like discomfort and singling-out mode.""",2024-04-02T10:06:32Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Donda Academy Lawsuit Levels New Racism, Antisemitism Claims Against Kanye West","Topline
The latest lawsuit filed against Kanye West over his private Christian school Donda Academy accuses the rapper, who now goes by Ye, of mistreating Black employees, praising Adolf Hitler in front of students, pretending to masterbate in front of employees and pushing to shave students' hair and lock them in cages.

Key Facts
Trevor Phillips, who worked for Donda Academy and West’s Yeezy brand for nine months in 2022 and 2023, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday accusing West of racial discrimination, harassment, whistleblower retaliation and other crimes and asking a judge to grant him at least $35,000 in damages. Phillips has accused West of hate speech, spreading antisemitic tropes, threatening the LGBTQ+ community and threatening him with physical violence after he spoke up against the rapper, claiming he was treated ""mercilessly"" and berated in front of students and parents after becoming a “target” of West’s. The lawsuit alleges a bizarre pattern of behavior by West including classifying Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, as “an innovator” and threats by West to turn his well-documented rants against Jewish people on the LGBTQ+ community, saying “gay people are not true Christians” and “are controlled by Bill Gates.” Phillips claimed West often said things to his staff along the lines of ""the Jews are out to get me"" and would spread antisemitic messages in front of the children, as well as once telling students he wanted to shave their heads and would install a jail at the school so ""they could be locked in cages."" Phillips claims West treated his white employees substantially better than those who were Black and would “​​scream and berate” Black employees while classes at Donda Academy were in session; he is also accused of telling employees they could be fired for being fat. As an employee, Phillips says he was subject to impulsive requests unrelated to his job, lived in fear of being spontaneously fired and was at one time present while West pretended to masterbate in front of him. Representatives for West did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment Tuesday.
Key Background
West in 2022 opened an unaccredited Christian private school named Donda Academy in California. Little is known about the inner workings of the school, which required parents, faculty and staff to sign non-disclosure agreements about their involvement. Students were reportedly required to wear Yeezy and Gap uniforms designed by the rapper before he lost his Adidas and Gap partnerships, according to Rolling Stone, and adhere to a daily schedule that included ""full school worship."" Tuition was reported to be $15,000 per year. The school was abruptly closed one month after it opened in the wake of antisemitic comments made by West on social media, but announced it would reopen hours later. The school has since shuttered again, but reports emerged last month that the rapper may try to revamp the school under a new name—Donda Ray Academy—at a new location in San Fernando Valley.
Tangent
Phillips’ lawsuit joins several others that have been filed about Donda Academy. In July, a former assistant principal at the school claimed he was fired for raising concerns about Donda’s infrastructure, which included a lack of hot water, windows without glass, electrical issues and poor sanitation. Two former teachers sued in 2022, saying they were racially discriminated against as Black women and claiming Donda was operating in violation of education, health and safety codes. The complaint alleged sushi was the only lunch option provided for students, and that West spent $10,000 per week on the meals.
Crucial Quote
In a statement to Forbes, Carney Shegerian—Phillips’ attorney—said the lawsuit was filed to show there is “no place in the world” for “discrimination, antisemitism and Hitler-love.”

Τα σπίτια των σταρ κάποτε και τώρα! Πού ζούσαν τότε και σε τι επαύλεις ζουν σήμερα!,"Rihanna , Kanye West , Ronaldo , Lionel Messi και Nicki Minaj είναι μόνο μερικοί από τους διάσημους που ξεκίνησαν από πολύ χαμηλά, έμεναν σε πολύ φτωχικά σπίτια και πλέον απολαμβάνουν τις ανέσεις των τεράστιων πολυτελών επαύλεών τους.
Χρειάστηκε βέβαια για να αποκτήσουν τόσα πλούτη και μεγαλεία να κάνουν πολλές θυσίες, να δουλέψουν πολύ και να κερδίσουν φανατικούς θαυμαστές για να μπορούν πλέον να έχουν μία άνετη ζωή και να απολαμβάνουν τους κόπους τους.
Για παράδειγμα ο Κριστιάνο Ρονάλντο ο οποίος θεωρείται ένας από τους πιο πλούσιους ποδοσφαιριστές ο οποίος ξεκίνησε από μία φτωχογειτονιά του πορτογαλικού νησιού της Μαδέρα για να διαθέτει πλέον διάφορες επαύλεις ανά τον κόσμο για να ξεκουράζεται και να απομονώνεται.
Η Ριάνα μεγάλωσε στο Μπρίτζνταουν όπου όμως πέρασε πολύ δύσκολα παιδικά χρόνια, αφού όλη η οικογένεια ζούσε σε ένα σπίτι τεσσάρων δωματίων. Η διάσημη τραγουδίστρια αναγκαζόταν να βοηθάει τον πατέρα της πουλώντας ρούχα σε ένα στασίδι του δρόμου, προκειμένου να καλύψουν τις βασικές τους ανάγκες. Σήμερα, απολαμβάνει τη διεθνή αναγνώριση και φυσικά χλιδή και πολυτέλεια στην υπέροχη έπαυλή της.
Ο Λιονέλ Μέσι, ο οποίος αποτελεί ακόμα έναν ζωντανό θρύλο του ποδοσφαίρου, έζησε για περίπου δεκατέσσερα χρόνια σε ένα χαμόσπιτο ενός ορόφου σε φτωχογειτονιά στην Αργεντινή. Από τότε που ξεκίνησε όμως την καριέρα του ως ποδοσφαιριστής, ο διάσημος ποδοσφαιριστής είδε στα πόδια του να ρίχνονται πολλά εκατομμύρια ευρώ προκειμένου ομάδες να τον αποκτήσουν. Τώρα, όμως, απολαμβάνει τη χλιδή και την πολυτέλεια της έπαυλης όπου ζει με την οικογένειά του.

Nach Namensänderung: Kanye Wests Instagram-Account gelöscht,"Macht Kanye West (46) einen Rückzieher? Vor rund einem Monat meckerte er auf Instagram, dass sein neuer Name nicht angenommen wird. ""Mein Name ist Ye. Keine Marke oder Nummer wird mich dazu zwingen, mich so zu nennen, wie sie wollen, dass ich immer noch heiße"", stellte der Rapper klar. Er verkündete, man werde ihn in den sozialen Medien nur noch unter seinem neuen Namen antreffen. Kurz darauf freute sich Ye in einem Update: ""Instagram hat zugestimmt. Ich warte auf die Informationen, die sie brauchen, um es heute zu erledigen."" Nun ist seine Seite jedoch deaktiviert – ob er sein Profil selbst gelöscht oder ob die Plattform Schritte gegen den Skandalmusiker ergriffen hat, ist unklar.
Kanye ist bekannt für seine impulsiven und Wutausbrüche im Netz. Kurz nachdem er seine Fans dafür kritisiert hatte, seinen neuen Namen nicht zu akzeptieren, fand er schnell ein nächstes Thema. Er forderte seine Ex Kim Kardashian (43) auf, den gemeinsamen Nachwuchs von der aktuellen Schule zu nehmen. ""Es ist die falsche Schule für Berühmtheiten, die vom 'System' benutzt werden"", wetterte er auf Instagram. Als Alternative schlug er seine eigene, nicht akkreditierte Schule vor.
Auch seine Beziehung zu Bianca Censori (29) sorgt regelmäßig für Kontroversen. Nachdem die beiden bereits wegen unsittlicher Outfits und Handlungen in der Öffentlichkeit mit dem Gesetz in Konflikt geraten waren, hat nun wohl auch der Vater der Australierin, Leo Censori, endgültig die Nase voll. ""Ihr Vater hat vor, ein ernstes Wort mit Kanye zu reden. Leo wird sich nicht von Kanyes Erfolg einschüchtern lassen und ihm die Stirn bieten"", ist sich ein Insider laut Daily Mail sicher.

"Kanye West, Ty Dolla Sign Cancel Arena 'Vultures' Listening Sessions","Anyone who was hoping to pay to hear the “Vultures” album played back in an arena in the near future may be out of luck. The next round of “listening sessions” with Kanye West, aka Ye, and Ty Dolla Sign for the album project has been called off, as the arenas that were scheduled to host the next round of large-scale playbacks in April announced over the weekend that the dates were canceled or otherwise quietly pulled the plug.
The canceled gigs had been scheduled for arenas in Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Pittsburgh, Nashville, Charlotte and Washington, D.C. The shows were scrapped within a day or two of first being announced.
A rep for Ye confirmed to Variety that the shows are not proceeding.
There was no immediate word on the cancellations from Ye himself, who apparently deactivated his Instagram account over the weekend.
The show cancellations come in the wake of mostly negative feedback over Ye and Ty’s opening-night gig at the Rolling Loud Festival in Inglewood, Calif., in which a set that was promised to consist of at least some live performance turned out to be another rolling of the “Vultures 1” tapes, with the two stars standing by on stage while wearing masks. No new material was premiered at the Rolling Loud playback.
The April gigs were being promoted as a “Vultures 1 & 2 Listening Experience.” But there has been no recent sign that the “Vultures 2” album is still on the way, even though the sequel was originally announced for a March 8 release. In recent weeks, Ye had put up Instagram posts indicating that he was toying with the idea of releasing “Vultures 2” only as a paid download, or through a new and exclusive streaming site, rather than a conventional rollout to DSPs.
The shows had been announced for Nashville April 7 at Bridgestone Arena, Pittsburgh April 9 at PPG Paints Arena, Washington, D.C. April 11 at Capital One Arena, Tampa April 14 at Amalie Arena, and Charlotte April 12 at Spectrum Center.
Some of the shows were not scheduled to go on sale until this week, while others had already begun ticketing. One social media user posted an email exchange with a rep for the D.C. venue which indicated that tickets had already been purchased and a refund would be issued. As of this writing, SeatGeek and StubHub still show hundreds of active listings for resale tickets for the performances.
The Ticketmaster page for Ye currently shows no concerts listed. The Florida arenas post posted messages saying: “We regret to report that due to the time constraints for Ye and Ty Dolla $ign to curate production and meet logistic requirements, the upcoming dates for the VULTURES 1&2 listening experience will need to be revisited at a later date.” A rep for the Charlotte venue told the Clture website that the gig was off.
In the wake of the seeming broken promises about the Rolling Loud gig including live performance, the latest material for the “Vultures” gigs appeared to be careful about what was being promised. Before the page was removed, a listing for the “Vultures” event on the Nashville Bridgestone Arena website described it as “a hi-fidelity audio experience.”
In an interview with Big Boy that ran just after the Rolling Loud controversy, Ty Dolla Sign defended not performing at the arena-sized playback parties, maintaining, “It’s still better than other people’s shows that have a mic.”",2024-04-01T17:42:18Z,https://variety.com,Variety

Bianca Censori covered up for an Easter outing with Kanye West and his four kids.
The Yeezy architect stepped out in a skintight silver catsuit for a night at the movies after they dined at celeb hotspot Nobu Malibu Sunday evening. The long-sleeved futuristic design is actually a bargain piece, with the Leohex one-piece look available to purchase on Amazon for just $60.
She opted for a strappy white heel, which she wore over the pant leg of her catsuit, and slicked her hair back into a bun.
Dressed in dark baggy pants and a jacket, West held hands with his 8-year-old son Saint while North, 10, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4, followed closely behind. Earlier in the day, the kids attended Kris Jenner’s over-the-top Easter party with mom Kim Kardashian.

"El declive de Kanye West: su nuevo disco es repetitivo, aburrido y predecible","Kanye West ha sacado nuevo disco, pero si vives en España, es muy probable que no te hayas enterado.
En febrero de 2024, Kanye West, quien se cambió su sobrenombre a Ye hace unos años, sorprendía a su ejército de fans con un trabajo colaborativo junto a Ty Dollan $ing, un nuevo álbum que venía a romper la larga racha sin sacar música del polémico artista. Sin embargo, no todo ha salido como él esperaba.
Vultures 1, que vino a estrenarse con un nuevo halo de polémica en las entrañas de la industria musical, lograba entrar como el más vendido en el Billboard 200, la principal lista de ventas en todo el mundo, sin embargo, en España no conseguía que ninguna de sus 16 canciones se posicionara ni el Top 50 de Spotify ni en su análogo de la manzanita, Apple Music, convirtiéndose en un lanzamiento bastante disimulado. ¿Por qué?
Kanye Omari West nunca ha sido un artista exento de polémica, sin embargo, la cosa se le ha ido de las manos. Últimamente, el artista atlantés de 46 años se ha centrado demasiado en cultivar su imagen de genio loco y polemista, sin embargo, todo este marco creativo no ha ido acompañado por detrás de un auténtico trabajo sublime que le dé la razón.
Los inicios de este rapero se remontan ya muy atrás, a finales de los noventa, cuando era conocido como productor. A sueldo de la compañía Roc-A-Fella, un mítico sello de rap asentado en Chicago, Kanye participó desde muy joven en la producción de todo tipo de álbumes y trabajos largos, consiguiendo un reconocimiento descomunal en la industria gracias a su implicación en The Blueprint, uno de los trabajos más importantes de Jay-Z (actualmente, este disco ha superado de largo las 100 millones de copias vendidas).
Portada de 'Vultures 1' Ye
Sin embargo, todo este éxito tuvo una contrapartida, y es que en la industria empezaron a verlo como productor, pero no como rapero: Kanye había creado una imagen tan atada a la creación de sonidos, a estar tras la mesa produciendo y haciendo de segundo espada, que ninguna discográfica terminaba de ver con buenos ojos que pegara el salto a rapear; hasta que todo cambió gracias a un accidente de coche.
En el año 2002, Kanye se salió de la carretera y se partió la mandíbula. Este incidente lo llevó a recibir un tratamiento posoperatorio con una especie de hierros en la boca que forzaban que permaneciera siempre semicerrada, algo que aprovechó para empezar a escribir algunos temas relatando su dolor para rapearlos con un tono diferente; en lugar de quedarse en la cama, West cantaba con la mandíbula casi cerrada, como si se estuviera susurrando para sí mismo, en una serie de canciones que le abrieron la puerta a hacer The College Dropout, su primer disco como rapero. De ahí, la historia es ya conocida: millones de copias vendidas, álbumes míticos en su haber como Yeezus y contratos estratosféricos con firmas como Adidas. Sin embargo, parte de esta historia se ha derrumbado.
Aunque el éxito de Vultures 1 ha sido implacable en EE UU – en el resto del mundo no se puede decir lo mismo –, su baja calidad musical, sus sonidos comunes ya refritos y los problemas que ha tenido con todo tipo de discográficas y distribuidoras han creado un producto sin demasiada coherencia, en muchos tramos aburrido, que vuelve a tratar de vendernos el discurso que el rapero lleva explotando hasta la saciedad en los últimos años: que es el Dios de la música.
Todo ese discurso divino, de creerse por encima del bien y el mal, le ha llevado en los últimos años a protagonizar algunas de las polémicas más absurdas, baratas y cínicas del mundo; desde querer presentarse a las elecciones con un discurso ultraderechista, pasando por practicar sexo oral en público en uno de los canales más frecuentados de Venecia hasta, y quizá este sea uno de los episodios más turbios, acosar a su exmujer, Kim Kardashian, con técnicas realmente turbias.

Todo este refrito de polémicas – no nos olvidemos tampoco de sus mensajes antisemitas, de haber filtrado sus contratos discográficos, de haber humillado públicamente a Taylor Swift, de haber asegurado que George Floyd murió por una sobredosis de fentanilo – ha deformado tanto esta imagen de supuesto Dios que ya no es ese ídolo molón y travieso al que seguirle el rastro, sino una persona que necesita más una visita al pabellón de psiquiatría que una nominación a los Grammys.
Kanye West ha perdido la mayor parte de su público gris, ese que escuchaba su música sin llegar al fanatismo, y se ha quedado con los oyentes más radicales y disciplinados de su séquito; además, no solo ha perdido el apoyo de los grandes jefes de la industria musical, sino que también ha sido despreciado por la escena más independiente.
Para Vultures 1, Kanye no consiguió ninguna distribuidora – ya no hablamos ni siquiera de discográficas – que le colocara el álbum en las plataformas digitales, por lo que tiró de FUGA, una de carácter independiente, para tratar de distribuirlo.
El nueve de febrero, fecha de lanzamiento del álbum, sus fans se dieron cuenta de que el disco había sido subido tanto a Apple Music como a Spotify, sin embargo, las canciones iban desapareciendo poco a poco de las plataformas: la distribuidora las estaba bajando porque Kanye había subido el disco sin permiso.
Según contó FUGA en un comunicado replicado por Billboard, Kanye tuvo una reunión con el equipo directivo de la compañía para que se hicieran cargo del disco, sin embargo, esta lo rechazó por la mala prensa que en ese momento tenía el rapero; aun así, esto no fue un impedimento para él, pues aprovechó las claves de un sistema de distribución automático de la compañía para subir el álbum sin su permiso, provocando que FUGA tuviera que salir inmediatamente a desmentir cualquier involucración con el artista para bajar después el álbum (hace diez años, cualquier distribuidora hubiera matado por tener los derechos de un disco de Kanye West).
Sin distribuidora alguna, West volvió a subir las canciones por libre, sin ningún sello o paraguas discográfico, pero los problemas no acabaron: Ozzy Osbourne, histórico de Black Sabbath y autor de Iron Man, canción que el rapero sampleo para su tema Good (Don’t Die), reclamó a las plataformas digitales por no haber dado su permiso para ese uso de sus derechos de autor y, otra vez, la canción fue bajada de Internet – ahora mismo, no está disponible en ningún lugar –.
Más allá de las decenas de polémicas, Kanye West se ha convertido en un artista que solo consumen los muy cafeteros de su obra, pero que no atrae al gran público ni a sus seguidores más grises por haberse centrado demasiado en él mismo y muy poco en su trabajo.
Vultures 1, en el que el coautor, Ty Dollan $ing, sale completamente eclipsado, es un disco mediocre y sin el más mínimo arco narrativo; es un compendio de canciones en el que West muestra como rompedoras técnicas que lleva aplicando 20 años – nadie se sorprende ya con las distorsiones vocales – y que viene sin ningún propósito lírico: las letras son malísimas.
Ahora mismo, la carrera de Kanye West – o Ye, ya no se sabe cuál es su nombre – se encuentra en su punto más bajo, pues nadie habla ya de su música o su creatividad artística, sino de la próxima polémica estéril y ridícula que protagonizará.",2024-03-30T07:23:27Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos

Fans should be aware that West has delivered offensive lyrics at recent shows.
While wearing a Jason Voorhees mask onstage, West rapped “And I’m still crazy, bipolar, anti-Semite. And I’m still the king,” which led to the event’s livestream being cut off.

About “Vultures, Volume 1”
West and Dolla Sign’s 16-track debut collaboration is classic Kanye; lush arrangement along with juvenile lyrics.
The album’s lead track, which features a gorgeous orchestral beat is undercut by off-putting lines like “Keep a few Jews on the staff now/ I cash out.”
You can listen to the sonically adventurous yet lyrically immature “Vultures” here.
Kanye West controversy
Over the past few years years, the 46-year-old Chicago native has generated quite a bit of ire.
His most notable recent dustup took place in late 2022 when he made a number of anti-Semitic statements which led to many companies he partnered with — including Gap, Adidas, and Balenciega — dropping him from their labels.
West has since apologized for his unfortunate comments on Instagram, although that post is no longer available to view on his account at the time of publication.
Following his statement, he made a number of anti-Semitic remarks at his inaugural ‘Vultures Listening Party’ concert in Chicago, according to the New York Post.

Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori 'needs a break',"Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori 'needs a break'
According to reports, Bianca Censori, Kanye West's wife, is upset about being utilised as a ""free marketing tool"" for his next album, Vultures 2.
The Donda rapper, 46, has been accompanied by Bianca on several of their outings in skimpy attire, and the musician routinely posts provocative pictures of his wife on social media.
According to a source, the Carnival hitmaker is ""pushing for more ahead of the release of Vultures 2,"" which is making things difficult for the Yeezy architect.
“She needs a break and needs to step back,” a tipster told Daily Mail. “She loved the attention but it is getting overwhelming and Kanye keeps pushing and pushing for more, more, more leading up to the release of Vultures 2.”
“She feels like he is using her as a free marketing tool – as does everyone else,” they said. “These past couple of months have been an experience, but she really wants to focus on having children after the album drops. She knows she is overexposed.”
This comes after several rumours that suggest Bianca's family was concerned about how the rapper was treating her. One of the allegations claimed that her father wanted to speak with Kanye about her garish clothes.
All of these rumours have recently been refuted by Bianca's sister Angelina, who stated that their family fully supports Kanye in his commercial ventures.
“We all support him. We support his new album. We support his new clothes he's dropping,” she told the Herald Sun.
“It's all just bulls**t. There was something about my dad even recently. My dad never talks. Nothing's true,” she added.",2024-03-29T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

Bianca Censori e Kanye West
Tira aria di crisi tra Kanye West e Bianca Censori? I due sono stati capaci di monopolizzare l'attenzione mediatica in ogni uscita di coppia, da diversi mesi questa parte. In particolare, è stato impossibile non notare e non soffermarsi sui look audaci e provocanti della 29enne. Questi outfit, che lasciano sempre poco spazio all'immaginazione, hanno sollevato polemiche e anche un po' di preoccupazione. In molti hanno ipotizzato che la donna non sia pienamente consenziente, ma piuttosto che sia succube del compagno e non del tutto padrona delle proprie azioni. I genitori stessi hanno espresso delle perplessità in merito alla condotta della figlia. Se fino a oggi fonti vicine alla coppia hanno sempre smentito questa versione, oggi un nuovo insider ha confidato al Mail Online le preoccupazioni della stilista.
Cosa succede tra Kanye West e Bianca Censori
Non c'è dubbio che in questi mesi Bianca Censori sia stata sottoposta a una notevole attenzione mediatica, una sovraesposizione frutto probabilmente di una vera e propria strategia imprenditoriale condivisa. Da un lato il tentativo sarebbe rafforzare il brand, dall'altro fare silenziosamente la guerra a Kim Kardashian. Una fonte vicina alla coppia, però, ha confidato al Mail Online che la 29enne australiana sarebbe in questo momento particolarmente turbata da tutta l'attenzione nei suoi confronti.
Bianca Censori
È come se si fosse resa conto di aver superato il limite, dunque non gradirebbe più certi sguardi così morbosi nei suoi riguardi. La moglie di Kanye West si sarebbe stancata di essere usata dal compagno in vista del rilascio per il suo prossimo album. A questo punto, mentre lui vorrebbe anzi alzare ancora di più l'asticella, lei vorrebbe invece fare un passo indietro. Ci sarebbe dunque un disaccordo sulla gestione dell'immagine della stilista, per nulla intenzionata a essere sfruttata ancora in vista dell'uscita di Vultures 2.
Bianca Censori
L'insider ha raccontato:
Ha bisogno di una pausa e di fare un passo indietro. Le è piaciuta l'attenzione, ma sta diventando travolgente e Kanye continua a spingere e spingere per avere sempre di più, fino all'uscita di Vultures 2. Lei ha la sensazione che lui la stia usando come uno strumento di marketing gratuito. Gli ultimi due mesi sono stati un'esperienza, ma lei vuole davvero concentrarsi sull'avere figli dopo l'uscita dell'album. Sa di essere sovraesposta.
Un problema simile lo aveva riscontrato anche Julia Fox. La modella nel 2022 è stata per un breve periodo legata al rapper. Al termine della frequentazione, durata un paio di mesi, ha dichiarato di essersi sentita travolta dal ruolo di musa ispiratrice che lui le aveva attribuito, perché necessitava di un coinvolgimento costante e totale, che dopo un po' non si è più sentita di dare.",2024-03-29T18:36:50Z,https://www.fanpage.it,Fanpage.it

Após perder diversos contratos por conta de algumas declarações, ele voltou a ser primeiro no Billboard Hot 100, por duas semanas, com Carnival, single de Vultures, seu novo álbum. Segundo Ye, ele é o único a ser descancelado.
""Eu sou a única pessoa que voltou para o número um depois de cancelamentos. Eu sou o GOAT (Melhor de todos os tempos, em livre tradução), e eu acredito em mim"", disparou em uma publicação.
E não parou por aí! Kanye ainda afirmou que desbancou grandes nomes do rap como, Kendrick Lamar e Drake.

"Kanye West Proclaims Himself the Only 'G.O.A.T.,' Takes Aim at Drake and Kendrick Lamar","'Back in the game,' Kanye West is letting his contemporaries know he's back and here to stay. The Praise God rapper bounced back after being canceled for his explosive anti-semitic remarks. In a deleted social media message, he aimed at Drake, with whom he's feuded for years, and Kendrick Lamar amid ""issues"" with Australian wife Bianca Censori.

The 46-year-old claimed his dominance in the hip-hop industry, ""Everyone knows I washed Kendrick on no more parties in LA,"" per The Sun. He then turned towards his longtime rival Drake, who's currently embroiled in a separate feud with Lamar. ""Everyone knows I washed Drake at the Free Hoover Concert,"" boasted Ye.
If fans could recall, the Yeezy founder subjected Drake to public humiliation after he posted a series of tweets (deleted shortly after) and called out, ""I've never mentioned or touched on anything related to the family when it came to Drake,"" and added a devil face emoji, per PEOPLE.
""He followed my wife on Instagram he mentioned Pusha’s fiance [sic] in a song,"" referencing his ex-wife Kim Kardashian with whom he was married in 2018. He slammed the Canadian rapper, ""Who's [sic] bright idea was it to tell Drake to follow my wife on Instagram?"" adding ""This person is not Drskes [sic] friend.""
Ye, in subsequent tweets, stretched the beef further and slammed Drake for ""dodging"" him and ""following"" his then-wife Kardashian. ""He dodged me for months when I extended olive branches to talk and then called to threaten me,"" wrote the Heartless rapper, echoing the same sentiment in 125 tweets.

Despite a slew of hateful and hurtful words, he insisted, ""I don't have beef with no one. Love everyone,"" but cautioned, ""Don't follow my f—ing wife on Instagram."" He went on to demand a public apology from Drake and wrapped up his rant with a contradictory emotion, ""I love everyone even Drake. That's my whole thing,"" concluding, ""Love everyone.""
However, this time, it wasn't personal. The 46-year-old ensured his contemporaries are aware of how his career graph has played out and that he's a force to be reckoned with. West reminded, ""Everyone knows I brought Adidas into this culture and took them out,"" adding, ""Everyone knows Lotta, Demna, Virgil, Jerry, [and] Kim all worked for me.""
He went as far as calling himself the only G.O.A.T., ""I am the only person to come back number one after cancellation,"" claiming, There is only one GOAT. I stand by me [and] My friends call me Ye,"" and signed off.

"In a Now Deleted Clip, Kanye West Revealed How P Diddy Allegedly Avoided Going to Prison","Details of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' alleged problematic behavior are gradually coming to light. Meanwhile, Kanye West attempted to disclose a deal Diddy made to be out of prison in an interview that was later deleted. However, some recently recovered footage showed West making some accusations about Diddy. This development coincides with reports from Mirror that law enforcement raided two of Diddy's residences earlier this week, allegedly linked to a sex trafficking inquiry. Diddy's attorney has, however, criticized these actions, denouncing them as a witch hunt.
Image Source: Getty Images | Photo By Shareif Ziyadat
Discovered from a past Drink Champs interview and now circulating online, a clip purportedly features West discussing a pact made by a few celebrities to avoid going to prison. In the clip, West accuses Diddy, referred to as Puff Daddy, of being a 'fed' who struck deals with law enforcement. These deals allegedly spared Diddy jail time in exchange for him blackmailing those in his circle, as per Marca. West was seen screaming in the clip by saying, ""The reason why you gotta talk is because you did a deal, you f***g fed!"" West further said, ""That's why you've gotta come at me, because part of the deal for you to be able to do all that and get out of jail is that you promised that you are gonna go pull my card.""
Shortly after it went viral, the complete interview was stopped from circulation because of West's remarks being deemed anti-Semitic and his insensitive comments regarding George Floyd's death. Meanwhile, Diddy is stuck in various lawsuits, including allegations of physical abuse, sexual assault, and sex trafficking. The Department of Homeland Security executed raids on several of Diddy's residences in Los Angeles and Miami on Monday. Following the raids, reports indicate Diddy departed the country aboard his private jet.
On Monday, the law enforcement said, ""Earlier today, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York executed law enforcement actions as part of an ongoing investigation, with assistance from HSI Los Angeles, HSI Miami, and our local law enforcement partners. We will provide further information as it becomes available."" Furthermore, Diddy's lawyer, Aaron Dyer, later said, ""Yesterday, there was a gross overuse of military-level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs’ residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.""
Federal agents raided the homes of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs amid sex crime allegations.
They grew suspicious after they tapped his cell and the phone in the basement. — Joey Woznicki (@Wozman23) March 28, 2024
Dyer continued, ""This unprecedented ambush -- paired with an advanced, coordinated media presence -- leads to a premature rush to judgment of Mr. Combs and is nothing more than a witch hunt based on meritless accusations made in civil lawsuits. There has been no finding of criminal or civil liability with any of these allegations. Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name.”",2024-03-29T03:46:21Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Alles gelogen? Biancas Familie steht hinter Kanye West!,"Bianca Censori (29) und Kanye Wests (46) Liebe findet sich ziemlich häufig in den Schlagzeilen wieder. Während es zumeist um die interessanten Outfits des Paares geht, wurden zuletzt aber auch Spekulationen laut, dass die Familie der Architektin sich wohl um ihr Wohlbefinden in der Beziehung sorge. Nun bezieht Biancas Schwester Angelina zu diesen Gerüchten Stellung: Die stimmen wohl überhaupt nicht! ""Wir alle unterstützen [Kanye]"", stellt sie im Interview mit Herald Sun klar und fügt noch hinzu: ""Das ist alles nur Quatsch. Kürzlich gab es etwas über meinen Vater. Mein Vater redet nie. Nichts davon ist wahr.""
Tatsächlich plauderte erst vor wenigen Tagen ein Insider gegenüber Daily Mail aus, dass Biancas Vater Leo Censori wohl ziemlich unzufrieden mit dem Verhalten seines Schwiegersohns sei. ""Ihr Vater hat vor, ein ernstes Wort mit Kanye zu reden. Leo wird sich nicht von Kanyes Erfolg einschüchtern lassen und ihm die Stirn bieten"", behauptete die Quelle. Er verlange, dass der Rapper für die Konfrontation zu ihm nach Australien kommt. Bianca sei davon wohl nicht begeistert: ""Sie weiß, wie ihr Vater reagieren wird.""
Doch scheinbar läuft im Eheleben des Musikers und der Yeezy-Mitarbeiterin alles rund und sie denken womöglich sogar schon an den nächsten Schritt. Zumindest deutet ein Songtext des 46-Jährigen dies an. ""Ihr wisst bereits, dass ich impulsiv bin und ein weiteres Baby mein Ziel ist"", rappt Kanye in seinem Song ""Timbo Freestyle"". Der Sänger hat bereits vier Kinder zusammen mit seiner Ex Kim Kardashian (43).

Kanye West Claims He 'Washed' Kendrick Lamar & Drake in IG Post,"Ye — the artist formerly known as Kanye West — took to Instagram on Thursday (March 28) with an explosive post claiming he got the best of Kendrick Lamar on their The Life of Pablo collaboration “No More Parties in L.A.” And he had smoke for Drake too, saying he “washed” him during their 2021 Larry Hoover Benefit concert at Los Angeles’ Coliseum.
“Everyone knows I washed Kendrick on No More Parties in LA,” West started the post, mentioning the 2016 bar-filled collab. Though the single from the hip-hop titans is certified platinum, the Madlib-produced track never cracked the Billboard Hot 100. Ye roped Drake in next, writing, “Everyone knows I washed Drake at the Free Hoover Concert.”
Trending on Billboard
Ye didn’t stop there, as he boasted about bringing Adidas back to cultural relevance and then taking them out since the apparel giant severed ties with him in 2022. “Everyone knows I brought Adidas into this culture and I took them out,” he wrote.
After claiming he invented every genre of music over the past two decades, Kanye reminded fans about his contributions along with his comeback to reach the mountaintop of the charts following his series of controversies and antisemitic remarks that caused many companies to split from the polarizing Chicago-bred mogul.
“I made Yeezus Dark Fantasy Pablo Graduation Throne 808s Throne,” he wrote. “I made ‘Runaway’ ‘Devil in a New Dress’ ‘Father Stretch.’ I am the only person to come back number one after cancellation. There is only one GOAT. I stand with me. My friends call me Ye :).”
It could be album-rollout time once again for Ye, with Vultures 2 rumored to be holding a release date of May 3. The first Vultures installment with Ty Dolla $ign topped the Billboard 200 with 148,000 album-equivalent units in February, while the album’s “Carnival” climbed to No. 1 on the Hot 100.
Ye is calling out Lamar and Drake a week after the release of Future & Metro Boomin’s “Like That,” which features an incendiary Lamar verse that seemingly takes lyrical shots at his “First Person Shooter” co-stars Drake and J. Cole. Now Ye appears to be taking sides in the Kendrick vs. Drake feud, and he’s choosing himself.

Kanye West Claims He Washed Drake And Kendrick Lamar,"Kendrick Lamar sparked a major debate in the world of rap last week. He dropped a single where he called out the other members of a supposed ""big three,"" Drake and J. Cole. That got everyone debating over who really deserved to sit atop contemporary rap's throne. It also got people debating over who would take which side in some kind of greater rap beef spawning from Kendrick's gauntlet. So far, none of that has happened but Kanye West may have just poured gasoline on the fire with a new Instagram post.
Seemingly unprompted, West decided to speak his mind. ""EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED KENDRICK ON NO MORE PARTIES IN LA, EVERYONE KNOWS I WASHED DRAKE AT THE FREE HOOVER CONCERT. EVERYONE KNOWS I BROUGHT ADIDAS INTO THIS CULTURE AND I TOOK THEM OUT, EVERYONE KNOWS LOTTA DEMNA VIRGIL JERRY KIM ALL WORKED FOR ME. I MADE YEEZUS DARK FANTASY PABLO GRADUATION THRONE 808S, I MADE RUNAWAY DEVIL IN A NEW DRESS FATHER STRETCH. I AM THE ONLY PERSON TO COME BACK TO NUMBER ONE AFTER CANCELLATION. THERE IS ONLY ONE GOAT. I STAND BY ME. MY FRIENDS CALL ME YE :)"" the full text of his Instagram post reads. Check out the fan reactions to the post below.

Kanye West Calls Out Drake And Kendrick Lamar With New Instagram Post
Kanye West may have slyly avoided playing a larger role in the ongoing Diddy drama of this week. Reports now claim that he turned down a meeting with the rap mogul just a few weeks ago. That meeting would have been fresh in a lot of fans' minds when two of his properties were raided by feds earlier this week.
What do you think of the claims Kanye made in his new Instagram post? Do you think he's washed both Kendrick and Drake in the past? Do you think he has the right to call himself the GOAT? Let us know in the comment section below.

Amber Rose never wanted to be known for her sexuality — but ex Kanye West had different plans.
During Thursday’s episode of “Just B with Bethenny Frankel,” the model claimed the “Heartless” rapper pushed her to dress sexier after their tumultuous relationship began in 2008.
“I am conservative actually,” the 40-year-old said. “I have always been conservative since I was young.”
However, Rose said she was turned into “this sexpot type of girl” once she rose to fame while dating West, 46.
10 Despite being “conservative” at her core, the model explained that West urged her to dress more provocatively. FilmMagic

“That was my first relationship with a celebrity ever but also in the public eye,” she explained. “And he knows a lot about fashion and he always wanted me to dress very sexy.”
The model explained that she was “young” and impressionable and went along with it despite knowing it wasn’t a reflection of her true self.
Even after she and the controversial rapper split in 2010, Rose said she couldn’t shake her “sexy” image and felt “pigeonholed” into one category.

“So when I was out on my own — without my first relationship that kind of brought me to the light — that’s what they wanted from me.”
And when Rose tried “to go against the grain,” she detailed that she was often met with backlash.
“I would have producers saying, ‘We want to do this video for MTV and we want you at the pool, with a bikini on, martini in your hand.’ And I’m like, ‘Ugh, I’m so not her.’ Like I’m so not her and I get what I come off as but I am so not her.'”
“And they’re like, ‘Well I guess you don’t want to do it then.'”

“It was like I remember fighting so hard to not be that person and no one would let me,” she said.

While West has always fitted his partners in provocative looks, he seems to have stepped it up a notch when it comes to Censori’s wardrobe.
The former Yeezy architect, 29, has stepped out in scandalous looks — often consisting of nothing more than sheer body stockings — so many times that her father, Leo Censori, reportedly plans to confront the “Jesus Walks” rapper.
Leo is planning to have “a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” per the Daily Mail.

“He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands,” their source added.
Despite fears that West is using fashion to “control” his wife, an insider close to the couple recently told us that Censori is totally on board with the provocative outfits.
“People are confusing Bianca’s creativity,” the source told Page Six. “She is a phenomenal personality, a phenomenal actor, who can entertain the public. She’s a performance artist. Bianca is as much a performer as Ye is.”",2024-03-28T20:44:42Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
Kanye wife Bianca Censori’s voice heard in resurfaced video,"Bianca Censori is making her voice heard in a recently resurfaced throwback video.
Most people familiar with the wife of Ye, born Kanye West, have never heard her speak. But a clip on Reddit has Censori speaking in a Zoom meeting during the 2022 CFS Summit in Paris back in her architectural design days at Yeezy.
The rapper’s wife was the head of architecture for the brand, which is where the couple initially met before eventually getting married.
“I’m an architectural designer from Melbourne, Australia,” Censori says in the video. “I currently reside in Los Angeles, and I’m a lead architectural designer at Yeezy.”
She goes on to boast about her experience in the field noting, “My passion for architecture lies in fabrication, conceptualizing the future of built space and exploring the bridge between the physical and the meta.”
The video of Ye’s typically silent wife speaking put the internet into a frenzy.
In addition, it’s clear Censori’s look has changed a lot over the years, In the video she has longer hair and a more natural look overall.
These days, Censori can be seen (but never heard) wearing jaw-dropping, flesh-baring outfits.
Before arriving at Yeezy, Censori spent three years as a student architect at Australian-based firm DP Toscano Architects before moving to the United States.
According to Elle, in a November 2021 interview with Hypebeast that has since been taken down, the architect shared more about her journey.
“I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia,” she said, via Elle. “As a child I was consistently drawn to creative endeavors, mostly artistic. I always wanted to be a sculptor and to me, architecture is the union of art and pragmatics. It is the grandest artistic gesture that we can place onto the earth. I was drawn to it, purely, as a shift in artistic scale.”
She continued, “As a child, I spent a lot of time with my aunt who would consistently expose me to an array of art, film, and architecture. She really drove my love for design and instilled in me an eye for aesthetics that I was able to nurture into adulthood.”",2024-03-28T19:59:22Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News
Kanye West avoids Sean Diddy after Rolling Loud performance: Here's why,"Kanye West avoids Sean Diddy after Rolling Loud performance: Here's why
Reportedly, Diddy asked Kanye West to meet with him after a show earlier this month, but Kanye turned him down.
The owner of Bad Boy Records reportedly told Kanye's representatives that he would like to meet Ye after the latter's performance at Rolling Loud in Los Angeles earlier this month. However, it appears that Kanye was not enthusiastic about the news and chose not to follow through.
Diddy went to the gig with his son Justin, and following the show, a photo of the two of them beside the main stage went viral. Famously, Diddy and Kanye fell out in public back in 2022 when Kanye accused Diddy of threatening him because he was Jewish.
Before that, Ye and Diddy got into a heated argument once more after the rapper called him out as he was selling t-shirts bearing the phrase ""White Lives Matter."" During that falling out, Kanye famously shared images of his text conversation with Diddy on social media.
It also coincides with Kanye's accusation in a 2022 interview that Diddy is ""fed"" and is coming out of jail.
The Gold Digger rapper lost it in the blast: ""The reason why you gotta talk is because you did a deal, you f*****g fed! That's why you've gotta come at me, because part of the deal for you to be able to do all that and get out of jail is that you promised that you are gonna go pull my card.""
A video of Diddy with a young Justin Bieber has since reappeared online as part of his continuing probe into sex trafficking. Diddy tells viewers in the video that he ""can't really disclose"" what they will be doing during their 48-hour time. Diddy is shown standing next to 15-year-old Justin.",2024-03-28T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Amber Rose reveals impact of ex Kanye West’s risque styling on her career,"Amber Rose and Kanye West dated for two years from 2008 to 2010
Kanye West has recently stirred up a storm for allegedly parading his wife Bianca Censori around in extremely revealing outfits. But though the couple have continued to dismiss all such speculations, Kanye’s ex-girlfriend Amber Rose has now come forward with a rather damning account.
On Thursday’s episode of Just B with Bethenny Frankel, the 40-yer-old television personality claimed that the legendary rapper, 46, used to control what she wore, creating a “sexpot type of” image of her that was against her own upbringing.
“I am conservative actually. I have always been conservative since I was young,” she said.
But things changed when she started dating Kanye West in 2008.
“That was my first relationship with a celebrity ever but also in the public eye. And he knows a lot about fashion and he always wanted me to dress very sexy,” she revealed.
Young and impressionable, Amber said she went along with Ye’s styling choices. But when they broke up in 2010, she couldn’t shake off the image he had created of her.
“So when I was out on my own – without my first relationship that kind of brought me to the light – that’s what they wanted from me,” she admitted.
Amber further recalled, “I would have producers saying, ‘We want to do this video for MTV and we want you at the pool, with a bikini on, martini in your hand.’ And I’m like, ‘Ugh, I’m so not her.’ Like I’m so not her and I get what I come off as but I am so not her.

“Oh, she sounds normal. the LA valley girl uptalk has gotten to her a bit, but aside from that she sounds normal,” one Redditor wrote, while another insisted Censori sounded like “a typical Melbourner.”
A third user noted, “It’s wild that this is the first time hearing her voice. I’ve seen more parts of that body that I have some people I’ve slept with, but that’s the first I’ve ever heard her talk??”
Many agreed that they had “no idea” Censori was Australian as she didn’t “give off [that] vibe.”

Censori first made headlines in January 2023 amid reports she and West, 46, had tied the knot.
Nine months later, the Daily Mail obtained a “confidential marriage license” confirming that the couple had secretly wed in December 2022, shortly after the rapper and his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, settled their divorce.
While West has primarily sported all-black outfits amid their marriage, Censori is known for showing skin everywhere from the streets of Florence, Italy, to the Cheesecake Factory at The Grove in Los Angeles.

This memorable occasion transpired when the content creator filmed Bianca in the VIP section while he sang Ye's song Back to Me.
As reported by The Daily Mail, later in the video, he can be seen singing and dancing with P Diddy, but his fans were more interested in his fleeting exchange with Bianca. He started filming the Australian model as he was belting out Kanye's song Back To Me, which has the line, ""Beautiful, naked, big-t***y women just don't fall out of the sky, you know?"" Bianca gave him a sly look, met his gaze, and giggled.

Kanye West Reportedly Turned Down Meeting With Diddy Just Weeks Before Federal Raids,"Kanye West and Diddy haven't always been on the best of terms. Back in 2022, Ye was publically calling Diddy out for allegedly threatening him. Moreover, the legendary artist called Puff a ""Fed"" at the time. Overall, it was just one of many feuds that Ye was getting himself into at the time. However, he is now mostly just trying to focus on his new Vultures projects with Ty Dolla Sign. Not to mention, he has also been enjoying his married life with none other than Bianca Censori.
As for Diddy, well, things are not going so well for him. On Monday, his homes in Miami and Los Angeles were raided by federal authorities. The operation was carried out on suspicion of sex trafficking. In the midst of all of this, TMZ is now reporting that Diddy was hoping to meet with Kanye back on March 14th in Los Angeles. That was the day of his Rolling Loud performance, which Puff attended. As the story goes, Puff was there with his family and entourage. He approached Ye's team and asked for a face-to-face meeting.

Es scheint, als wären die beiden einfach süchtig nach Schlagzeilen: Während sich die Medien in den vergangenen Monaten vor allem über die freizügigen Outfits der australischen Architektin und die merkwürdigen vermummten Auftritte des Rappers das Maul zerrissen haben, bietet der aktuelle Post des 46-Jährigen erneut Stoff für Lästereien.
Kanye West, der nur noch unter dem Namen ""Ye"" auftritt, filmte seine Frau Bianca vor drei Tagen im Schlafzimmer, genauer gesagt im Bett des Paares.

Kanye West Exposed Diddy’s Immoral Actions in a Video Unearthed From a Deleted Drink Champs Interview,"Kanye West is known for mincing no words, apart from being a rapper. However, this time he shed light on Sean 'Diddy' Combs' immoral behavior that went unnoticed by many but the rapper. As more information emerges regarding Diddy's troubling (mis)conduct, it appears that individuals within both Hollywood and the music industry may have been aware of his pattern of sexual misconduct for quite some time.

Among those individuals is West, who reportedly attempted to disclose information about a deal Diddy made to avoid legal repercussions, although the interview containing this revelation later vanished. In a clip from West's contentious Drink Champs interview in October 2022, he claims that P Diddy is an informant who struck deals with law enforcement to avoid incarceration by leveraging blackmail against those in his circle.

""The reason why you gotta talk is because you did a deal, you f*****g fed! That's why you've gotta come at me, because part of the deal for you to be able to do all that and get out of jail is that you promised that you are gonna go pull my card,"" West screamed in the viral video. Drink Champs decided to pull the full episode due to his offensive remarks, including the notorious anti-Semitic comments and insensitive remarks about George Floyd's death. Regrettably, this move also diverted attention away from West's remarks regarding Puff. Although the accuracy of his allegations remains in question, the unfolding revelations about Combs still expose concerning aspects.

Multiple residences linked to Diddy were raided by the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles and Miami. Following the raids, reports suggest Diddy fled the country aboard his private jet per TMZ. According to Marca, Prince Harry, Meek Mill, and Justin Bieber are among the notable figures whose involvement has been mentioned in the alleged offenses.

Meanwhile, West is on and off the media scrutiny as Bianca Censori, the rapper's spouse, is known for creating buzz with her choice of outfits. According to sources cited by OK! Magazine, within their social circle, there's a notion that the couple perceives Censori's unconventional fashion as a type of 'performance art.'

Kim Kardashian apparently blames ex-husband Kanye West for her recent split from Odell Beckham Jr.
The former couple are said to have called it quits earlier this week following a six-month whirlwind romance.
Speaking to The Sun, a source revealed that the Kardashians star is “upset” over her inevitable association with the Yeezy mogul, with whom she was married to for a decade until 2021.
They went on to explain that the NBA star gave up on his relationship with Kim to avoid being targeted by the rapper.
“She’s upset, of course, because she feels like Kanye has turned his life - and hers - into a circus,” revealed the insider.
“It’s crazy right now - every day Bianca is out in a new outrageous outfit, and everyone’s talking about them,” they continued.
“I just think that Odell wasn’t willing to deal with the drama and potentially becoming the target of one of Kanye’s rants.
“They were really into each other but at some point, it just didn’t seem worth it.
“Kim blames Kanye’s antics for this - she’s wondering if she’ll ever find someone who can deal with her ex,” added the source.
After being romantically linked since September, Kim and Odell largely kept their romance under the wraps with no joint public appearances.

Kanye West Subtly Takes Sides In Drake & Kendrick Lamar Beef,"Kanye West has had his issues with Drake over the years. Overall, their feud was one that fans wanted to see resolved. Although they seemingly let bygones be bygones back in 2021, they seem to be at odds again. Ye has taken some shots at Drake on social media, and he has also mentioned the artist in a few of his in-person rants. Having said that, one can assume he has been paying attention to the Kendrick Lamar ""Like That"" situation. Lamar dissed Drake on the song, and the record has taken the world by storm. Meanwhile, We Don't Trust You also seems to spell the end of Drake and Future's illustrious friendship.
Needless to say, Drake is vulnerable right now, which is the perfect time for Ye to attack. Well, fans believe West did just that. In the tweet below, you can see that Ye recently shared an Instagram story. This IG story contains a link to his infamous collaboration with Kendrick Lamar, ""No More Parties In L.A."" The track appears on The Life Of Pablo, and is considered to be one of the best songs on the album. When you put two and two together, you can deduce that this might just be a way for Ye to pick sides without actually saying anything.

As it stands, fans are waiting for Drake to issue his response. However, he has yet to do so. Some believe he has until Friday to get his response filed away, while other fans believe there is no timetable. No matter what, it is clear that hip-hop fans are hoping for a full-blown battle. When Pusha T challenged Drake, Push came away with the win. If Drizzy wants to get back in the win column, a response is mandatory.
Let us know what you think of the feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake, in the comments section down below. Do you think Drake is going to issue some sort of response? If he does, do you believe Kendrick has another song ready to be unleashed? Additionally, stay tuned to HNHH for the latest news and updates from around the music world.

"Insider Reveals, Kanye West Uses Wife Censori's Bold Outfits as 'Performance Art'","Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori frequently draw attention when they appear in public, particularly because of her daring outfit choices. Now, insiders suggest that the rapper has a deliberate motive behind this. Censori's provocative wardrobe choices have left the public puzzled, and individuals within their social circle are suggesting that they are intentionally using fashion to provoke and confuse the public, according to OK! Magazine. Sources claim that West views Censori's bold fashion statements as a form of 'performance art'.

An insider said, ""People are confusing Bianca’s creativity. She is a phenomenal personality, a phenomenal actor, who can entertain the public. She’s a performance artist. Bianca is as much a performer as Ye is."" Others in West's inner circle, such as his musical collaborator Malik Yusef, have suggested that his recent photo of Censori lounging on an enormous bed in a sheer white lace bodysuit and matching heels was merely a display of their luxurious lifestyle. He said, ""I think it’s Ye saying, ‘My b**** is living in the lap of luxury. I don’t know what you all are doing today, but I hope you’re all just chilling like me. This is my business.’ The room is all bed. It’s a new context on bedroom.""
According to Kanye West's inner circle, he sees dressing Bianca Censori as 'performance art.' https://t.co/pefOBxYepc — OK! Magazine USA (@OKMagazine) March 25, 2024
Additionally, Censori's outfit choices have also piqued fans' attention because it has led many to wonder if she is just playing puppet to West. According to The Daily Mail, an insider said, ""Bianca has always had social media and she was active on it– until she married Kanye. He doesn't want her to have it because he thinks that it will hurt her if she has to read the nasty things that people say. He convinced her that, since she is a star now, she has to remain a mystery and it is creepy to those who know her as it feels like another form of control."" Others close to Censori and the fashion designer have however stated otherwise.
While elaborating on how she is involved in West's brand, a source said, ""She’s a senior advisor to Ye and a senior creative and business advisor to the entire team...She interacts with people independently of Ye. Bianca has a lot of influence— she helps control the design, who we’re selling to, who we’re collaborating with. She’s fully in."" Yusef added, ""Ye allows her a platform to be her full self. She knows he has power and she knows she is protected. He’s got a bunch of men around him with power. So she can experience her full self without any deleterious effects…without being harmed or touched or aggressed by anybody.""

According to several sources, Censori's father, on the other hand, has asked West to come to Australia after his wife expressed concerns about his intimidating behavior during her recent visit. A source said, ""Kanye has been invited to go to Australia and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react."" Furthermore, amid the constant spotlight on their public appearances, the couple, who got married in 2022, appear to be collaborating to maintain their relevance. A source said, ""You only see her when he needs to parade her for some sort of fashion moment. He partners with whoever’s hot at the moment. He’s approaching 50, and he’s harder to stay relevant— especially with his loony history.""",2024-03-27T02:16:02Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Ist Kanye West schuld an Kim Kardashians Trennung von Odell?,"Kim Kardashian (43) macht ihrem Ex-Mann Kanye West (46) offenbar Vorwürfe, nachdem ihre Beziehung zu dem Footballspieler Odell Beckham Jr. (31) in die Brüche gegangen ist. Nach einer stürmischen sechsmonatigen Romanze sehen sich die 43-jährige Reality-TV-Ikone und der 31-jährige NFL-Star nicht länger als Paar. Insider berichten gegenüber The Sun, dass Kim befürchtet, ihre Verbindung zu Kanye könnte potenzielle Partner abschrecken. Ein nahestehender Vertrauter enthüllt: ""Sie ist natürlich aufgebracht, weil sie das Gefühl hat, Kanye hat ihr Leben – und seins – in einen Zirkus verwandelt. Jeden Tag sieht man Bianca in einem neuen, skandalösen Outfit und alle reden darüber."" Die Quelle fügt hinzu, dass Odell möglicherweise nicht bereit gewesen sei, sich mit dem Drama und Kanyes Wutanfällen auseinanderzusetzen.
Die Beziehung zwischen Kim und Odell entflammte im September 2023 erstmals. Ihren ersten gemeinsamen Auftritt in der Öffentlichkeit hatten die beiden beim Super Bowl in Las Vegas im Februar. Im März präsentierte sich das Paar auf der Oscar-Vanity-Fair-Afterparty noch sehr vertraut. Nun werden aber immer mehr Stimmen laut, die behaupten, dass sie sich getrennt hätten. Kim, die von 2014 bis 2021 mit Kanye verheiratet war, sieht sich nun mit der Herausforderung konfrontiert, nach Kanye, der mit seinen Handlungen und Aussagen wiederholt Schlagzeilen macht, erneut die große Liebe zu finden.
Seit ihrer Scheidung von Kanye, der mittlerweile Bianca Censori (29) geheiratet hat, hatte Kim Schwierigkeiten, eine neue Liebe zu finden, die bereit ist, mit dem Einfluss ihres Ex-Mannes umzugehen. Kanye erschwerte es Kim vor allem während ihrer Beziehung mit dem ""Saturday Night Live""-Star Pete Davidson (30), indem er Pete bedrohte und ihm vorwarf, seine Familie zu zerstören. Das alles gipfelte in einem animierten Musikvideo, in dem Pete entführt und enthauptet wurde – ein Werk, das Kanye verteidigte. Pete musste als Folge davon eine Therapie machen.

Ye und Bianca Censori: Neues Video sorgt für Spekulationen,"Los Angeles (USA) - Der Rummel um dieses Skandal-Pärchen beruhigt sich einfach nicht! Kanye ""Ye"" West (46) und seine Frau Bianca Censori (29) sorgen nach einem Video aus dem privaten Schlafzimmer erneut für Aufregung im Netz.

Es scheint, als wären die beiden einfach süchtig nach Schlagzeilen: Während sich die Medien in den vergangenen Monaten vor allem über die freizügigen Outfits der australischen Architektin und die merkwürdigen vermummten Auftritte des Rappers das Maul zerrissen haben, bietet der aktuelle Post des 46-Jährigen erneut Stoff für Lästereien.
Kanye West, der nur noch unter dem Namen ""Ye"" auftritt, filmte seine Frau Bianca vor drei Tagen im Schlafzimmer, genauer gesagt im Bett des Paares.
Man sieht die 29-Jährige in einem weißen Spitzen-Bodysuit in der Mitte des Bettes liegen, in ihrer Hand ein Smartphone, das ihr Gesicht verdeckt, an ihren Füßen weiße High Heels, die farblich mit ihrer Kleidung zusammenpassen. Im Hintergrund hört man den Verkehr einer Straße in der Nähe.

Odell Beckham Jr. bis Kanye West: Die lange Liste Kim Kardashians Verflossener,"Kim Kardashian (43) ist wieder Single. Nach nur sechs Monaten soll zwischen der berühmten US-Reality-Darstellerin und dem Footballer Odell Beckham Jr. (31) alles aus und vorbei sein,wie die ""DailyMail"" unter Berufung auf eine gemeinsame Freundin berichtet. Mit dem NFL-Star hatte sich zuletzt auch ein Sportler in Kardashians recht vielseitige Liste an Verflossenen eingereiht, die unter anderem aus Musikern, Schauspielerin und Comedians besteht.
Odell Beckham Jr. (September 2023 - März 2024)
Kennengelernt haben sich Kim Kardashian und Odell Beckham Jr. im Oktober 2021 bei der TV-Show ""Saturday Night Live"". Aber erst zwei Jahre später sollen sie sich näher gekommen sein. Im September 2023 wurden sie dann erstmals beim Turteln erwischt, obwohl Kardashian noch länger betont hatte, dass sie nur befreundet seien. In den vergangenen Monaten sah man die beiden jedoch immer wieder zusammen, auch Händchen haltend. Alles deutete auf eine ernste Beziehung hin. Nach sechs Monaten verpuffte das kurze Liebesglück aber offenbar wieder.
Pete Davidson (Oktober 2021 - August 2022)
Vor dem Football-Star war es Pete Davidson (30), der Kim Kardashian glücklich gemacht hat - zumindest für eine Weile. Der US-Comedian ist aber auch bekannt dafür, in Sachen Frauen nichts anbrennen zu lassen. Mit Kardashian war er etwa neun Monate liiert, die beiden zeigten sich auch regelmäßig zusammen auf dem roten Teppich und bei Veranstaltungen. Am Ende soll es angeblich an der großen Entfernung und ihren vollen Terminkalendern gescheitert sein. Kardashian erklärte nach der Trennung aber auch, dass sie sich nach der Scheidung von Kanye West (46) wieder zu früh auf eine andere Beziehung eingelassen habe und dies bereue. Im August 2022 war berichtet worden, dass Davidson sich in eine Traumatherapie begeben hatte, nachdem Kanye West ihm in den sozialen Medien mehrere Male gedroht und ihn sogar für tot erklärt hatte. Nicht der einzige fragwürdige Auftritt von West.
Kanye West (2014 - 2022)
Apropos Kanye West: Obwohl der US-Rapper schon seit Jahren mit fragwürdigen Verhaltensweisen Kritik auf sich zieht, hat Kardashian mit ihm ihre längste Ehe geführt - mit vielen Höhen und Tiefen. Anfang 2012 wurde aus den beiden ein Paar, zuvor waren auch sie nur befreundet. Letztere zwei wurden per Leihmutter geboren. Die Hochzeit fand im Mai 2014 statt. Sie bekamen die vier gemeinsamen Kinder North (10), Saint (8), Chicago (5) und Psalm (4). Doch West sorgte über die Jahre mit zahlreichen kontroversen Aussagen und Auftritten für Furore. Unvergessen bleiben seine Präsidentschaftskandidatur im Juli 2020 und seine antisemitischen und rassistischen Äußerungen, wegen denen er zuletzt viele Werbe-Deals verloren hatte. Damit wollte offenbar auch Kim Kardashian nichts mehr zu tun haben, sie reichte 2021 die Scheidung ein, die seit März 2022 offiziell gültig ist.",2024-03-25T20:20:04Z,https://www.bunte.de,BUNTE.de

And now Kanye West — far at the other end of the celebrity spectrum — has been snapped there on a date with wife Bianca Censori.

Why? We don’t know. We’re certainly not going to go there to find out. (There’s the unflinching journalistic pursuit of the truth and then there’s going to the Cheesecake Factory, y’know?).
Could it be that — in an age when the Manhattan elite jealously compare private club memberships — the strip mall’s second-finest holds a refreshing popular appeal?
Could it be that — with every Bushwick storefront claiming to be home to artisans — a place that proudly identifies as a factory is a relief?

Could it be that — of the four people we just mentioned — fifty percent are either a clinically insane bigot and or married him, so maybe they just don’t make great choices?

What Happened Between Meek Mill & Kanye West?,"The Hip Hop industry is fraught with feuds and beefs, and sometimes it’s hard to determine their origins.

Let's peel back the layers to uncover the truth behind the headlines and of course, social media spats.

July 2020: Ye's Grievances With Meek Mill & Kim K Meeting
In the midst of Ye's divorce from Kim Kardashian, the Chicago-born native made a bombshell allegation regarding Meek Mill and Kim. The Vultures 1 artist suggested that Kim attempted to make a move on Meek. ""I been trying to get divorced since Kim met with Meek at the Warldolf [sic] for 'prison reform,'"" West wrote. ""Meek is my man and was respectful. That's my dog,"" he added, before claiming that ""Kim was out of line."" In response, Meek called ""cap"" and the tension between them seemed to have been put to an end.
October 7, 2022: Meek Mill Enters The Chat Amid White Lives Matter Controversy
In early October 2022, Kanye West held his Paris fashion show. There, he was spotted wearing a shirt that bore the phrase “White Lives Matter.” The rapper and record producer was also seen with the frequent controversy stirrer, Candace Owens. Unsurprisingly, she also donned the same shirt in white. Knowing the sentiments that phrase carries, it’s no surprise that there was immediate backlash.
One of the celebrities who called West out was Boosie. He tweeted: “@kanyewest AFTER ALL WE BEEN THROUGH AS A RACE YOU PUT THIS DISRESPECTFUL SHIT ON!! U GIVES NO FUCKS ABOUT HOW BLACKS HAVE DIED N SUFFERED TO THE HANDS OF THE WHITE MAN. N U SAY BUSH DONT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE…REALLY NIGGA.” A few days later, Kanye responded to Boosie’s tweet with a now-deleted tweet. He wrote: “Speak to me. Yeah little nerd ass me come smack me or come shoot me. I’m the one that got bullied by the entire black celebrity community now I’m back to shoot the school up.”
On October 7, 2022, Meek Mill joined the conversation and called Kanye West. He wrote a long post on his Instagram story speaking on how he felt about West’s tweet against Boosie. He wrote: “I used to listen to ye every night and jail for motivation on god. And came home and watched him shit on my name and brand like nothing. I ain’t say nothing, but I been knew you was on that nerd tryna shit on street N***as you just said it to Boosie… it hurts my heart to even know some of y’all this crazy and lame.”
October 16, 2022: The Infamous Drink Champs Interview
Days after Meek Mill’s Instagram statement, Kanye West went on Drink Champs. The entire interview was filled with outlandish comments from West, which caused the video to be taken down soon after it was uploaded. He not only made false claims about George Floyd’s death, but also made several anti-Semitic comments. To top it all off, Kanye brought also up Meek Mill’s name, labeling Meek a fed. “All you fake hard n***as, fuck you,” he said. “You can’t shoot nobody anyway, and the only reason you talk is because you did a deal you fucking fed.”

November 20, 2022: “God Did”
By November, Meek Mill released his freestyle music video for the track, “God Did.” The track centered on Meek Mill's triumphs and tribulations. On it, he reflected on his modest origins, advocacy for prison reform, and subtle jabs aimed at the 2024 presidential hopeful. However, it was clear that Meek Mill also had some words for West that he needed to get off his chest.
He rapped: “I will never sell my soul for money, like I’m Kanye/ It’s crazy I used to bring you on my cell house on lock day/ Famous b**ches got my idols lookin’ at me sideways/ I don’t need no verses from you n***as, I did it my way.”
December 2022: Kanye Laughs At Meek Mill
During a conversation with Wack 100 on Clubhouse, West revisited the controversy surrounding his ""White Lives Matter"" t-shirt. He then directed his criticism towards Meek Mill, and couldn't contain his laughter when the notion of Meek offering him advice was brought up. He said, laughing: “And I put White Lives Matter on a t-shirt. And they said, you know what let's go get celebrities, let's go get Puff Daddy, let's get Dave Chappelle, let's get Meek Mills. What makes somebody think Meek Mills can say something to me? This is the funniest thing. Yo man, I'm about to start crying laughing. Somebody thought Meek Mills? Sorry. I'm literally in tears. Somebody say, Meek Mills.""
That same day, Meek responded to West with a tweet that read: ""Never lost my mind for fame or money. I still have my family… my people respect me… I’m freeing people from prison… I’m doing community service all month with children up close and personal.” He ended his message with the line, “I’m chilling wit my son and his friends today.. y’all on clubhouse at 50 lol.""

March 2024: “Carnival”
Kanye took to his Instagram account on March 11 to share a video commemorating the success of his latest chart-topper, ""Carnival.” In his celebratory post, Ye took the opportunity to specifically mention Drake, Hailey Bieber, the Three Stripes brand, and several others. Around the same time, his interview with Big Boy launched where he delved into similar conspiracies about supposed ""handlers"" in the music industry, including the Philadelphia rapper. Meek Mill then took to X to speak on the matter. It was then that he stated that he was confused why their beef started.
He wrote: ""I think Yeezy smart but be off a lil but because I bought like 17 pair of Yeezys since we been trading rap shots. And I listened to your music to get me through my bid you a super legend I was more confused of why you was going so hard to go at me in the beginning. When you see us going at it it’s always rap beef we know each other personally and would never let it go to far! It’s a bloody sport gotta be rough wit it."" Ye has yet to respond to the tweet.

Kanye West’s Wife Bianca Censori Stuns in Blue Backless Bodysuit,"Kanye “Ye” West and Bianca Censori stepped out for another Los Angeles date recently, and they reportedly hit the movies! The rapper, 46, was seen in social media clips wearing an all-black ensemble, while his wife, 29, stunned in a light blue backless bodysuit with white lace tights.
The Yeezy architect completed her look with a pair of white high heels, as she and the “Stronger” rapper were photographed at The Grove in L.A. over the weekend. She also ditched the bra for her aquamarine outfit — a fashion choice she’s been making as of late. Bianca also tied her hair back in a neat bun.
Ye and Bianca’s outing comes just three days after a report surfaced, claiming that the model’s family isn’t thrilled with her husband. The two have been married since December 2022.

Her dad [Leo] still plans to have a sit-down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye’s power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits.”
The outlet also reported that Bianca’s mother, Alexandra, had paid her daughter a visit earlier this year. According to the insider, Alexandra wanted to “assess” Bianca’s “situation.”
“Bianca’s mom had to see for herself after Bianca told her family she has this under control,” the source noted. “This has been a wonderful opportunity for Alexandra to get to spend time with Bianca and assess the situation for herself.”
Although the insider acknowledged that Ye “has started to turn things around since the release of Vultures in the sense that he is not going off on as many unhinged rants,” Bianca’s dad reportedly still wants to hash out his alleged grievances over his daughter’s fashion changes.
“Yes, Bianca dressed provocatively while her mother was there, but it was nothing in comparison to some of the outfits she has worn prior to and since the visit,” the insider concluded.
Last year, a separate report surfaced, alleging that Bianca’s family was concerned about her marriage to the “Heartless” artist. Ever since the two went public with their romance, Bianca has worn risqué fashion pieces, from see-through tops to miniskirts.",2024-03-25T16:49:09Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
Kanye West filmt seine Frau im Bett: User achten aber nur auf dieses Detail,"Los Angeles (USA) - Der Rummel um dieses Skandal-Pärchen beruhigt sich einfach nicht! Kanye ""Ye"" West (46) und seine Frau Bianca Censori (29) sorgen nach einem Video aus dem privaten Schlafzimmer erneut für Aufregung im Netz.

Es scheint, als wären die beiden einfach süchtig nach Schlagzeilen: Während sich die Medien in den vergangenen Monaten vor allem über die freizügigen Outfits der australischen Architektin und die merkwürdigen vermummten Auftritte des Rappers das Maul zerrissen haben, bietet der aktuelle Post des 46-Jährigen erneut Stoff für Lästereien.
Kanye West, der nur noch unter dem Namen ""Ye"" auftritt, filmte seine Frau Bianca vor drei Tagen im Schlafzimmer, genauer gesagt im Bett des Paares.
Man sieht die 29-Jährige in einem weißen Spitzen-Bodysuit in der Mitte des Bettes liegen, in ihrer Hand ein Smartphone, das ihr Gesicht verdeckt, an ihren Füßen weiße High Heels, die farblich mit ihrer Kleidung zusammenpassen. Im Hintergrund hört man den Verkehr einer Straße in der Nähe.

Despite speculation West has been manipulating Censori into her risqué outfits, a source recently told Page Six otherwise.
“People are confusing Bianca’s creativity,” the insider said. “She is a phenomenal personality, a phenomenal actor, who can entertain the public. She’s a performance artist. Bianca is as much a performer as Ye is.”

Bianca Censori Wears a Fur Jacket and Appears Serious While Out With Kanye West and North West,"Bianca Censori opted for a more modest look while dining out with her husband Kanye West and his daughter, North West, whom he shares with Kim Kardashian, on Saturday night. The model, known for her daring fashion choices, wore a fur coat, which was something from her usual revealing attire, as noted by The US Sun. This change in style has sparked speculation among her family members, who reportedly disapprove of Kanye's perceived influence over his wife. Nonetheless, the Yeezy designer's fur jacket concealed her toned physique entirely, featuring a large white zipper down the front.

She styled her brunette hair in an elegant updo and chose a natural makeup look. Her outfit included fitting black pants paired with tall-heeled boots. Meanwhile, North and Kanye coordinated in matching all-black outfits. Kanye wore loose-fitting black parachute pants with a matching hooded sweatshirt, accessorized with black Nike gloves and sunglasses. North sported bedazzled black sweatpants and a football jersey with the number 75, complemented by a black satin bonnet. Censori and North held hands, and North beamed joyfully during the outing.
Censori's more covered-up appearance coincides with rumors that Kardashian was unhappy with how her ex-husband's new spouse dressed when around their children, North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm, according to Page Six. A source recently said, “Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids. She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.” Despite their past differences, it seems that Censori and Kardashian are making efforts to reconcile. Both were seen showing their support for Kanye at the Vultures listening party in San Francisco earlier this month.

Furthermore, Censori's father has placed the blame on Kanye for his daughter's troubling behavior, prompting him to request a face-to-face meeting with the contentious rapper. He has allegedly reached out to Kanye, urging him to travel to Australia for a conversation. This decision followed Censori's mother reuniting with her daughter and son-in-law in Los Angeles during one of Kanye's performances. She is said to have informed her husband about Kanye's intimidating behavior, leading him to take action. ""Kanye has been invited to go to Australia and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react,"" an insider said.
""Her dad still plans to have a sit down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye’s power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits,"" the insider added. Since getting together with her rapper partner, Censori has been turning heads with a series of daring outfits. Just recently, she made a bold statement at the Cheesecake Factory in West Hollywood, California, donning a sheer bodysuit with booty shorts, showcasing her figure. Before that, she made headlines by going underwear-free in another see-through bodysuit while out in Los Angeles with Kanye.",2024-03-25T10:04:57Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Kanye West not manipulating Bianca Censori, outfits are 'art'","Kanye West and Bianca Censori simply might be trolling us all.
As the rap superstar, 46, and his wife of 15 months make jaws drop with their bizarre outings — in which she is almost always scantily clad in skintight, often sheer body stockings — it seems they are having the last laugh.
According to a fashion industry source who is close to the pair, West and Censori, 28, know exactly what they are doing. And, despite rumblings that he is manipulating her, insiders say she is totally in on it.
“People are confusing Bianca’s creativity,” the source tells Page Six. “She is a phenomenal personality, a phenomenal actor, who can entertain the public. She’s a performance artist. Bianca is as much a performer as Ye is.”

It certainly looked like some kind of act on Thursday when West posted an Instagram video of Censori dressed in a lace bodysuit and white heels, lying on a comically large bed and staring intently at her cellphone.
West is nowhere in sight, though you can hear the cameraman — speculated to be him — breathing.
While the video garnered more than 981,000 “likes” from his 20.3 million followers — one of whom cheekily commented, “Why’s she got more clothes on in bed than when she goes outside?” — one member of West’s camp describes the post as “a crucial picture.”

Malik Yusef, a musical partner of West, tells Page Six: “I think it’s Ye saying, ‘My bitch is living in the lap of luxury. I don’t know what you all are doing today, but I hope you’re all just chilling like me. This is my business.’ The room is all bed. It’s a new context on bedroom.”
It’s also the latest example of Censori flouting convention with her clothing, or lack thereof, all over the world over the past year. She stepped out in Florence, Italy, wearing what appeared to be a pair of sheer tights — no pants or skirt — and clutching a throw pillow to her chest in lieu of a top. There was the skintight red bodysuit in Tokyo, as well as a gold one that completely covered her head and face. In Milan, it was a black napkin-like leotard that covered her some of her front, some of her back and nothing on the sides.
This week in Los Angeles, she went to the Cheesecake Factory in a tiny bandeau top and neon-green tights — which West rolled down at the waist, exposing her butt cheek, before strolling inside.
13 Sources told Page Six that Censori is “in control” of what she wears and at the Yeezy fashion line. Instagram
It’s all sparked social-media speculation and headlines about whether West is a Svengali-like puppet master forcing his wife to parade around nearly naked.
But sources tell Page Six that Ye is no controller where Censori is concerned — and is, in fact, dreaming up these see-through concoctions herself.
Says one source who knows them both well: “Maybe she’s using him as her puppet!”

The fashion source also notes that Censori’s mother, Alexandra, has been with the couple in Los Angeles — one of the many places they live, though they reportedly don’t have a permanent home.
“Her mother was here [in Los Angeles] the other day,” says the fashion source. “Her parents are fine [with the relationship].”
For more Page Six Style …
According to Yussef, “She makes her own decisions on how to dress. I think [she and West] experiment together and say, ‘Hey, this is beautiful.’”
13 “Maybe she’s using him as her puppet!” a fashion source said of Censori and West. angelinacensori/Instagram
Last September, Page Six reported that the two dream up the outfits and have a “whole atelier in Italy” that whips them up on the fly.
“Anything he wants to make, they can make it. He’s really just making it on the spot,” said Mowalola Ogunlesi, the Nigerian-born, London-based designer hired by West in 2020 to head his Yeezy Gap collaboration.
“They design it and have an in-house team that creates everything in a day,” said a second designer who has worked with West but asked to remain anonymous.
13 Before her latest makeover, Censori resembled West’s ex Kim Kardashian. biancacensori/Instagram
Ogunlesi added at the time that “they just buy tights and style it and cut it on [Censori]. … Usually they get Wolford. Tights are not safe when they’re around.”
Censori, a trained architect, works with West on his Yeezy fashion line — as does Dov Charney, the former CEO of American Apparel. The fashion industry source says, “Bianca is an important part of the management team. She’s controlling the business in a very big way.”
Asked what her role is, the source shares, “She’s a senior advisor to Ye and a senior creative and business advisor to the entire team. … She interacts with people independently of Ye. Bianca has a lot of influence — she helps control the design, who we’re selling to, who we’re collaborating with. She’s fully in.”
13 Bianca Censori dined in a tiny bikini top and posed for a photo that did major numbers on Instagram. kanyesposts/Instagram
Out of the office, according to Yusseef, “Ye allows her a platform to be her full self. She knows he has power and she knows she is protected. He’s got a bunch of men around him with power. So she can experience her full self without any deleterious effects … without being harmed or touched or aggressed by anybody.”
Even while growing up in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe, Censori was far from a shrinking violet.
Hanging out at Australia’s Rainbow Serpent music festival in 2017, she was photographed wearing a revealing top that exposed tassel pasties on her nipples. After attending a ritzy private school and developing a reputation for being a social butterfly, she landed at University of Melbourne and graduated with an architecture degree in 2017.

She was briefly partnered in a jewelry business called Nylons and characterized as a local “It” girl by a school friend, according to the Daily Mail.
In 2020, Censori met West when he slipped into her DMs and wrote, “come work for me.”
According to a former friend, she dropped out of college to do so.

Following West’s 2021 split with Kim Kardashian, Censori began working for West as his architectural designer, and the two wed in December 2022, one month after his divorce from Kardashian was finalized.
“Kim hates her,” a source told Page Six in 2023. “She’s pretty and Kim hates pretty girls.”
Nevertheless, things have apparently mellowed between them. Earlier this month, Kardashian and Censori were seen hanging out together at a San Francisco listening party for West’s new album “Vultures.”

One source told The Post: “He’s in full promo mode right now.”
And, late last year, when West hosted a listening party at Art Basel, Censori accompanied him and three of his four children with Kardashian.
“Right before the performance started, she left the stage with security, and she was carrying one of his kids, Chicago,” a source who worked with West on the party told The Post. “She looked very maternal. I think she is definitely a muse for Kanye.”
13 “You only see her when he needs to parade her for some sort of fashion moment,” a source said of West and Censori.
A source confirms the muse status — but also maintains Censori is in the limelight at the pleasure of West.
“You only see her when he needs to parade her for some sort of fashion moment,” the source tells Page Six. “He partners with whoever’s hot at the moment. He’s approaching 50, and he’s harder to stay relevant — especially with his loony history. The revolving door keeps moving faster and faster.”
For now, though, it’s apparently all about the performance and doing it their way, no matter what anyone thinks.
“They have people worldwide watching them,” the fashion source says. “Sometimes the highest form of art is to not say anything.”",2024-03-25T10:00:00Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
"Hasim Rahman Jr. Blasts Viddal Riley Over ""Biggest Waste of Potential In Boxing"" Remarks","Lately, Hasim Rahman Jr., 12-2-0, fought an impersonator of Kanye West at a backyard brawl.

Bianca Censori sends stern message to Kim Kardashian with 'step-mum mode',"Bianca Censori sends stern message to Kim Kardashian with 'step-mum mode'
Bianca Censori sent a stern message to Kim Kardashian with her 'appropriate step-mom mode' during a dinner date with North West.
The Australian beauty was recently spotted with her husband Kanye West and his 10-year-old daughter, whom he shares with the Skims founder.
The trio were captured arriving for an intimate dinner at the celebs' favourite eatery Nobu in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday night.
Interestingly, Bianca, who often made it to the headlines due to her racy outfit choices, covered herself with an oversized thick fur coat paired with black leggings.
Speaking of the Architectural designer's appearance, body language expert Judi James told The Mirror that she ""provides much more of a family vibe.""
The expert detailed, ""In her suddenly discreet fur coat Bianca seems fully aware of a more appropriate step-mum mode here, covering up to walk with North, providing signals of affection and closeness to the young girl who seems to be very close to her in terms of admiration and friendship.""
Notably, it was previously reported by Daily Mail that the reality TV star ""instructed"" her former love interest ""to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids.""
For the unversed, Kim was married to Kanye for ten years. However, the two parted ways in 2021.
The former couple co-parents their four kids, North, 10, Saint, 7, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4.
Soon after their high-profile divorce, Kanye reportedly tied the knot with the Australian beauty in 2022.",2024-03-24T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

Censori’s conservative look comes amid reports that Kardashian, 43, didn’t like how her ex’s new wife dressed around their shared children: North, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4.
A source told the Daily Mail, “Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids. She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.”
However, it appears as if Censori and the Skims founder are attempting to put their differences aside. The two were spotted supporting West at the hitmaker’s “Vultures” listening party in San Francisco on March 12.

Censori appeared slightly uncomfortable with her fit as she used her phone to cover her privates from paps.
Her risqué looks reportedly have her father, Leo Censori, concerned as he’s voiced his desire to sit down with West to discuss how he parades his wife around like a “trashy naked trophy pony,” per Daily Mail.

Sources close to Leo told the outlet that he has doubled down on his request and asked West and Bianca to meet him in Australia.
According to the insiders, Bianca is “hesitant” to see the family patriarch and face his anger.
“Kanye has been invited to go to Australia and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react,” the source told the Daily Mail.

‘A Trashy Naked Trophy Pony’: Bianca Censori's Dad Is Reportedly Unhappy With His Daughter And Kanye's Fashion Exploits,"If publicity is really one of the reasons why Kanye West is making Bianca Censori wear revealing outfits , it definitely seems to be working. The Yeezy staffer’s scandalous attire has sparked quite a bit of debate, including whether or not Censori is being controlled by her husband of just over a year. Her mother traveled from Australia this month to visit the couple, allegedly to check the situation out for herself, and according to sources, she isn’t the only parent who’s alarmed by Censori’s recent exploits.
Bianca’s father Elia “Leo” Censori is allegedly quite unhappy with his daughter’s fashion choices of late, some of which are so daring she could be facing a fine or even jail time . In fact, an insider for OK! magazine said Leo allegedly wants to ask Kanye West what he’s thinking when he ""parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony.” The magazine now reports that according to a source:
They hate her revealing style, which is all Kanye’s idea. They think she looks trashy. It wouldn’t be surprising if Leo has a sit-down with Kanye one day soon.
Does that mean Kanye West is in for meetings about his relationship with Bianca Censori with both of his wife’s parents? Time will certainly tell, but if the insider is correct, Leo Censori doesn’t seem to be one to mince words regarding his opinions.
Given the outrageous outfits we’ve seen Bianca Censori sporting lately — including the neon green tights and tube top she adorned for some recent business meetings and the see-through leggings she wore with no underwear to Paris Fashion Week — one can imagine how that might not sit right with her father, and Leo allegedly wants to know what Kanye West would think about his own daughters dressing in such a way when they're older. The insider said:
He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands. He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife.
Appealing to Kanye West as a father might be a good route to go, as the rapper mentioned his daughters in a 2022 rant about Kris Jenner allowing Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner to pose for Playboy. “Pornography destroyed my family. I deal with the addiction. Instagram promotes it. Not gonna let it happen to Northy and Chicago,” he wrote in an Instagram post that was deleted soon after.
It would be interesting to see what would come from a meeting between Kanye West and his father-in-law, Leo Censori, regarding the risque outfits that Bianca has been wearing, and that includes what Bianca herself would tell her dad about her new wardrobe. Ye’s wife reportedly “has a lot of say in what she wants to wear ,” and she’s long been reported as having a strong influence on Ye’s work .",2024-03-24T17:21:28Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Kanye West quer ser chamado de Ye e diz que nome de registro é 'de escravo',"""Ye é uma das pessoas mais reconhecidas do mundo, a par com presidentes e papas"", inicia a carta de Yiannopoulos.
Ele explicou que Ye não decidiu mudar o nome ""potencialmente sacrificando parte do imenso valor capturado pela marca 'Kanye West'"".
A alteração é para valer: ""A mudança foi feita de forma completa, legal e permanente. Isso é quem ele é agora. O nome dele é Ye"", ressaltou a carta.
O comunicado se direciona para as plataformas de streaming, editores, lojas, sindicatos, sites de letras de música e revendedores de dados: ""Essa mudança vai acontecer em todos os lugares"".
Uma das justificativas de Ye é que seu antigo nome se refere ao período da escravização de negros: ""Ele em várias ocasiões se referiu a ele como seu nome de escravo. Ye é um homem negro nos Estados Unidos da América que quer o direito à plena autodeterminação, assim como todo mundo"".
Ye usa esse nome desde 2018 quando lançou um disco com mesmo nome. Agora os esforços são para que tudo seja referido a ele dessa forma na indústria musical.",2024-03-24T01:17:34Z,https://www.uol.com.br,UOL

That’s his name, don’t wear it out.
Kanye West’s chief of staff, Milo Yiannopoulos, demanded in a letter that the rapper be referred to as Ye and not his “slave name.”
“Ye is one of the most recognizable people in the world, on par with presidents and popes,” the letter obtained by Page Six read.

“He didn’t take the decision to change his name, potentially sacrificing some of the immense value captured by the brand of ‘Kanye West,’ lightly. The change was made fully, legally, and permanently. This is who he is now. His name is Ye.”
Yiannopoulos, 39, wrote that he is calling on “streaming platforms, publishers, stores, unions, lyrics websites and data resellers” to make the change since they are some of “the most visible places.”
“He has on several occasions referred to it as his slave name,” the letter continued. “Ye is a black man in America who wants the right to full self-determination just like everyone else.”

The far-right political commentator’s memo comes more than two years after a Los Angeles judge signed off on the “All of the Lights” rapper’s legal name change.
In August 2021, West, 46, claimed in court documents that he was changing his moniker due to “personal reasons.”

“In the Bible, it means ‘you,’” he said. “So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us. It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye.

Kanye West’s wife Bianca Censori ditches risqué fashion sense for latest outing,"Bianca Censori dresses up with Kanye West in dinner outing
Bianca Censori dressed up more covered than usual for her recent outing Saturday night.
The model, who has been in constant headlines for her revealing outfits, rocked a fur coat while heading out to dinner with her husband, Kanye West, and the rapper's daughter North whom he shares with ex-wife Kim Kardashian.
Censori fashioned an oversized thick beige coat, which she styled with black leggings and pointed high heels for dinner at Nobu in Beverly Hills, Calif.
She did her hairdo in a slicked back low bun.
Censori, a 29-year-old Yeezy architect, was seen hand-in-hand with North, who was seen beaming broad all the time. The 10-year-old wore a Raiders jersey.
She fashioned the casual look with black pants and shoes.
The rapper, 46, stunned in his traditional all-black look with a hoodie, pants, boots, Nike gloves and sunglasses.
Censori’s rarely-descent look comes after rumours of the rapper's ex, Kardashian, 43, criticising the model’s dressing sense.
A source said, “Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids. She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that,” as per Daily Mail.",2024-03-23T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West played nice on Friday as they supported their son Saint at his basketball game in Los Angeles.
Despite recently butting heads about their kids’ schooling, the pair appeared to be on such civil terms that the rapper, 46, seemingly put his arm around his ex-wife, 43, for a quick hug. Each parent was also seen giving their 8-year-old son an encouraging hug.
West and Kardashian both dressed casually for the outing, with the “Kardashians” star sporting a fitted, white crew neck T-shirt and cream-colored Balenciaga sweatpants.

She signed on as an ambassador for the Spanish fashion house in January — less than two years after she claimed she was “re-evaluating” her relationship with the brand amid its 2022 campaign scandal.
Kardashian paired the comfy look with chunky white and gray sneakers, and wore a black baseball cap over her long, braided hair. She completed the outfit with a fuzzy white Balenciaga purse.
West, meanwhile, opted for an all-black ensemble of sweats and a hoodie paired with Nike kicks — possibly a jab at Adidas after their partnership went sour in 2022 following his antisemitic rants.

The “Runaway” hitmaker and Kardashian’s civil night together watching Saint came less than two weeks after the latter attended her ex’s “Vultures” album listening party in San Francisco.
She was photographed at the time hanging out with West’s current wife, Bianca Censori, but the pair didn’t appear to be besties by any means judging by their stiff body language.
Censori, 29, did not appear to be present at Saint’s basketball game Friday.
West and Kardashian — who were married between 2014 and 2022 and share four kids — seem to be making an effort to work on their relationship after they publicly feuded over their children’s schooling earlier this year.

Sogra de Kanye West vai passar um tempo com a filha,"Kanye West, Bianca Censori / Grosby Group / Instagram/@kanyewest
Kanye West recebeu uma visita inesperada esta semana. Sua sogra Alexandra, mãe de sua esposa Bianca Censori, chegou aos Estados Unidos para passar alguns dias com a filha e o genro, e assim ver com seus próprios olhos o que está acontecendo no relacionamento.
Amigo da esposa de Kanye West revela a verdade sobre ela
Diante de tantos boatos negativos sobre a relação de Kanye e Bianca, a mulher achou melhor viajar para a Califórnia, segundo afirma o jornal “Daily Mail”.
Uma fonte comentou que ‘Alexandra visitou sua filha na esperança de salvá-la de Ye’, embora o rapper esteja fazendo o possível para conquistar a sogra.
“A mãe de Bianca teve que ver por si mesma depois que Bianca disse à família que ela tinha tudo sob controle”, disse o informante.

“Esta foi uma oportunidade maravilhosa para Alexandra passar um tempo com Bianca e avaliar a situação por si mesma.”
No entanto, o artista de “Vultures 1” supostamente está “falando docemente” com sua sogra enquanto tenta convencê-la de que Bianca está bem com ele.
“Agora é um momento crucial e Alexandra acreditou discretamente que viria para salvar sua filha. Mas este não é o caso”, acrescentou a fonte.
“Kanye começou a mudar as coisas desde o lançamento de Vultures, no sentido de que ele não está fazendo tantos discursos descontrolados”, continuou a fonte do jornal.

A visita da sogra aconteceu justo quando um amigo de Censori defendeu seu estilo, e afirmou que ela sabe exatamente o que está fazendo.
Embora uma fonte anterior afirmasse que Ye é quem força a mulher a usar esses looks picantes, seu amigo sugeriu que Bianca tem seu próprio plano.

“Ela investiu muito em seu casamento com Kanye e seu plano de jogo está começando a ficar aparente”, acrescentou a fonte.
“Ela é proprietária de sua linha de roupas, de sua música – ela é a única modelo em seu último vídeo e na capa de ‘Vultures’ – de seus investimentos imobiliários e muito mais.

Bianca Censori 'hesitant' to fly home with Kanye West after her dad ‘demands’ to talk to rapper about bizarre marriage,"KANYE West's wife, Bianca Censori's dad, Leo Censori, has seemingly become disillusioned by his daughter's marriage.
Leo's desire for Bianca, 29, to bring Kanye, 46, to his home in Australia for a man-to-man discussion reportedly had Bianca on edge.

Leo insisted that the married couple come and see him after Bianca's mom, Alexandria Censori, recently visited her in Los Angeles, California, under the pretense of saving her from her relationship.
An insider divulged to The Daily Mail that Leo believed that Alexandria seeing Bianca further ""enabled Bianca to continue doing what she is doing.""
Though Bianca dressed provocatively around Alexandria, it was ""nothing in comparison to some of the outfits she has worn prior to and since the visit,"" the insider added.
Leo appears to be fed up with the Kanye-fied version of his daughter that sprouted from their eccentric union.
Which is why he wants to see them in the Land Down Under, much to Bianca's reluctance.
""...Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react,” the source told The Daily Mail.
“Her dad still plans to have a sit down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye’s power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits.”
Leo has reportedly been seeking to converse with the Vultures rapper since early March.
'TRASHY TROPHY'
He supposedly wants to know ""what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” the Daily Mail revealed.
A source told the publication: ""[Leo] wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.
Bianca Censori looks distressed as she wears just a bra & silver ripped underwear on tense outing with Kanye West in LA
He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife.""
Leo's worries about Bianca's new aesthetic have been ongoing since she and Kanye tied the knot in December 2022.
BOLD BIANCA
Bianca's ensembles have seemed to get racier and racier following her and Kanye's nuptials.
Earlier this week, the Australian architect was spotted running errands with the Grammy-winning entertainer in Burbank, California.
Bianca donned a sheer black catsuit with fabric so thin it exposed her breasts, and nether regions.
She minimized her private region being fully seeable as best she could by using her phone to shield her pubic area.
Bianca styled the bold look with a pair of black heels, slicking her short black hair was slicked back to show off her pierced ears.
The week before, Bianca boasted her bodacious body in a skimpy pink mini-dress as she visited a beauty store in Los Angeles.
Her plunging garment showed off a generous amount of side boob while also flaunting her toned legs.
Bianca paired the dress with sheer knee-high socks and kitten-heel pumps, arranging her hair in her signature slicked-back style.

Kanye West möchte Bianca Censori offenbar bald schwängern,"Bei Kanye West (46) und Bianca Censori (29) könnte es bald so richtig ernst werden! Der US-Rapper und das Model sind angeblich seit Dezember 2022 verheiratet. Besonders die Beauty macht seit der Bekanntgabe der Beziehung immer wieder wegen ihrer freizügigen Looks auf sich aufmerksam. Und damit könnte es noch nicht genug sein: In einem Songtext deutet Kanye an, dass er mit seiner Frau weiteren Nachwuchs plant. Im Song ""Timbo Freestyle"" rappt er: ""Ihr wisst bereits, dass ich impulsiv bin und ein weiteres Baby mein Ziel ist.""
Im Dezember 2023 kündigte der Ex von Kim Kardashian (43) an, weitere Musik zu veröffentlichen. Darunter auch den Song ""Timbo Freestyle"", in dem es gegen Ende ziemlich privat wird. Kanye rappt von seinem Kinderwunsch, den er sich höchstwahrscheinlich mit seiner Frau Bianca erfüllen will. Wie ein Insider gegenüber Daily Mail verriet, sei die 29-Jährige von dem Gedanken ziemlich angetan. ""Er ist ihr Ehemann, also hat sie natürlich darüber gesprochen"", so die Quelle. Dass Bianca die Stiefmutter von Kanyes Kindern ist, habe ihren Wunsch nach eigenem Nachwuchs nur noch verstärkt.
Während sich die Brünette offenbar sehnlichst Kinder mit Kanye wünscht, können sich Biancas Eltern mit diesem Gedanken eher weniger anfreunden. ""Sie wollen, dass Bianca Kinder hat und würden gerne Großeltern sein, aber sie wollen auch, dass die Kinder in einem stabilen und liebevollen Haushalt aufwachsen. Das Leben mit Kanye ist überhaupt nicht stabil"", meinte ein Insider aus dem engen Umfeld zu wissen.

Kanye West shares intimate bedroom video of Bianca Censori,"Kanye West is at it again, posting more suggestive content of wife Bianca Censori for public consumption.
The controversial rapper, 46, who’s fresh off the release of his “Vultures 1” album, has now just one post on his Instagram timeline — a seconds-long clip of the 29-year-old Yeezy architectural designer lying in the middle of their massive bed, her phone in front of her face, as she dons a lacy white bodysuit and strappy heels.
It’s conservative content compared to what the “Gold Digger” rapper usually posts of Censori, who he married at the end of 2022, mere weeks after finalizing his divorce from Kim Kardashian.
While West, who now legally goes by “Ye,” has largely found himself on the outs with mainstream media in the wake of repeated antisemitic rants, he regularly makes headlines now for his polarizing hobby of sharing sexually charged and nearly nude images of Censori — from a see-through get up at Art Basel to showing off her bare backside and side-boob at home. Onlookers have expressed concern as they’ve accused him of objectifying her.
Back in January, he shared since-deleted photos that had people telling Censori to “blink if you need help.”
“Someone save this woman from emotional abuse,” remarked one commenter.
Some defended the couple, however, with one noting that “there’s a good chance that she’s into the same things he’s into. This is most likely their kink.”
While celebrating Censori’s birthday in January, the “Heartless” rapper praised her as “the most beautiful super bad iconic muse inspirational talent artist masters degree in architecture 140 IQ loving by my side everyday when half the world turned their backs on me and the most amazing stepmom to our children” — referring the four kids he shares with Kardashian.",2024-03-22T18:38:50Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News

She decided to address the confusion, claiming that she didn't believe Ye was suing her. ""He has not told me he is suing me,"" she explained. ""I have not seen HIS signature on the paper. The letter of intent to arbitrate was very clearly written by Milo. Signed by Ye’s lawyer, who is also at the will of Milo. If the suit moves forward and Ye allows it to, sure i may feel different. & i’ll do what needs to be done to defend myself. I have no fear because i’ve done no wrong.""

""I pray for his continued success & protection."" Another user then brought up the fact that Ye shared the lawsuit on his Instagram Story, which she also seemingly attributes to someone besides him. ""Then why was it deleted so fast? What other posts do you see going up and down that fast? He is not the only one with access to that account,"" she wrote.

"Kanye West: Το αινιγματικό βίντεο με την Bianca που ""τάραξε"" τα σόσιαλ","Οι θαυμαστές του Kanye δεν μπορούσαν να πάρουν άκρη από το βίντεο
Το Instagram του Kanye West αναστάτωσε ξανά τα νερά του διαδικτύου, καθώς ανέβασε ένα μυστηριώδες βίντεο την Πέμπτη 21 Μαρτίου. Στο βίντεο, μπορούμε να δούμε τη σύζυγό του, Bianca Censori, να βρίσκεται σε ένα εντυπωσιακό υπερκρεβάτι.
Η Censori εντυπωσίαζε με το λευκό ολόσωμο στράπλες ρούχο της, συνδυασμένο με ψηλά τακούνια. Η πόζα της με το ένα πόδι λυγισμένο προσέδιδε μια αύρα μυστηρίου, ενώ το πρόσωπό της κρυβόταν πίσω από το τηλέφωνό της, που κρατούσε πάνω από το κεφάλι της.
Αν και ο ίδιος ο Kanye West δεν εμφανίζεται στο βίντεο, ακούγεται η αναπνοή ενός ανθρώπου στο παρασκήνιο, προσθέτοντας ακόμη περισσότερο στην αίσθηση μυστηρίου.
Οι θαυμαστές του Kanye δεν μπορούσαν να πάρουν άκρη από το βίντεο, με πολλούς να σχολιάζουν ότι το κρεβάτι μοιάζει με αυτό από το διάσημο μουσικό βίντεο ""Famous"" που κυκλοφόρησε το 2016.

Rita Ora singt in Hamburg: Weltstar eröffnet Einkaufszentrum,"Sängerin Rita Ora (33) hat unter anderem den Titelsong für den Film „Shades of Grey“ gesungen
Von: Markus Arndt
Hamburg – Sängerin Rita Ora (33) ist ein Weltstar. Diverse Nummer-Eins-Hits, Millionen verdient, mit Größen wie Kanye West (46), Jay-Z (54) oder Ed Sheeran (33) zusammengearbeitet. Und jetzt eröffnet sie ein Einkaufszentrum in Hamburg.
Auch interessant Anzeige Auch interessant Anzeige
Wie bitte? Ja, tatsächlich. Ora gibt zur Eröffnung des „Westfield Hamburg-Überseequartiers“ am 25. April ein Live-Konzert.
Was der Spaß den Investor Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield kostet? Absolute Geheimsache. In der Branche gilt allerdings als ausgemacht, dass es sich mindestens um eine hohe sechsstellige Summe handelt.
Der Ora-Auftritt am Abend soll der Höhepunkt eines spektakulären Eröffnungstages werden. Die Engländerin wird ihre weltbekannten Hits (u.a. „How We Do“, „Your Song“, „Black Widow“) auf einer Bühne direkt an der Waterfront, der Kaifläche mit Blick auf die Elbe, des Einkaufszentrums performen.
Der Westfield-Gebäude-Komplex an der Elbe ist so gut wie fertig
Der mächtige Gebäude-Komplex steht direkt an der Elbe. Die Daten sind beeindruckend:
– 419 000 m² Bruttogrundfläche. Baukosten: mehr als 1,6 Milliarden Euro
– 80 500 m² für Einzelhandel, ca. 55 000 m² für Wohnen und ca. 65 000 m² für Büros
– für Kultur- und Entertainment sind rund 12 000 m² vorgesehen, für Gastronomie ca. 8000 m²
– unterirdischer Busbahnhof und – für Kunden ganz wichtig – 2500 Parkplätze
Mit dieser Mischung will der Investor massiv Kundenströme aus der derzeitigen City, vor allem aus den Haupteinkaufsmeilen Mönckebergstraße und Spitalerstraße, in die HafenCity locken.
Anders ausgedrückt: Klappt das, gehen in vielen Bereichen der derzeitigen Hamburger City die Lichter aus, fürchten Handels-Insider.
Karten für das Ora-Konzert gibt es übrigens nicht zu kaufen. Sie werden verlost. Wie und wo dazu gibt‘s noch keine Infos.
Rita Ora wird‘s egal sein. Sie freut sich auf Hamburg: „Es ist mir eine große Ehre, beim Grand Opening des Westfield Hamburg-Überseequartier aufzutreten. Der Abend wird unvergesslich, da bin ich mir sicher.“",2024-03-22T16:42:42Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD
El padre de Bianca Censori volvió a exigir un encuentro con Kanye West,"Bianca Censori enfrenta críticas por su estilo de vida y moda tras su matrimonio sorpresa con Kanye West. (Créditos: Backgrid/The Grosby Group)
Leo Censori, padre de Bianca Censori, manifestó su deseo de confrontar personalmente al esposo de su hija, el controvertido rapero Kanye West. Esta demanda surge en medio de las polémicas alrededor del matrimonio sorpresa entre Bianca y Kanye y las críticas dirigidas hacia el estilo de vida y las elecciones de moda de la arquitecta australiana de 29 años.
Según Daily Mail, el hombre extendió una invitación a Kanye para que visite Australia, con el objetivo de tener una conversación cara a cara, aunque Bianca parece reticente a facilitar este encuentro debido a la posible reacción adversa de su familia.
La preocupación de Leo no es solo por la vestimenta atrevida de Bianca, quien fue vista luciendo atuendos reveladores que captaron la atención del público y generado críticas. La influencia de Kanye en el estilo y comportamiento de Bianca también ha sido motivo de preocupación para sus cercanos, quienes temen que el rapero esté controlando o limitando de alguna manera a su esposa.
“Kanye ha sido invitado a ir a Australia y Bianca duda en permitir que esto suceda porque sabe cómo reaccionará su padre”, reveló una fuente cercana. Además, informaciones indican que la madre de Bianca, Alexandra, viajó previamente a los Estados Unidos en un intento de “salvar” a su hija, aunque aparentemente sus esfuerzos no tuvieron el efecto deseado.

Esta no es la primera vez que se reporta la molestia del padre de Bianca. A finales de febrero, una fuente de Daily Mail aseguró que Leo tenía planes de confrontar a West ya que no toleraba que su hija se convirtiera en “un producto comercial”.
“Leo sinceramente quiere sentar a Kanye para hacerle saber que está haciendo daño a su familia al convertir a su amada hija en un producto comercial de mala calidad. Ningún hombre debería animar a la mujer que ama a salir en público y presentarse así. Eso no es amor. Eso es control”, declararon las fuentes al medio británico.
Al parecer, Censori no sólo está preocupada por la reacción de su padre, quien además estuvo arrestado por posesión de drogas en los años 80′s. Bianca también es sobrina de “el Al Capone de Melbourne”. Eric, hermano de Leo, se encuentra pagando una cadena perpetua por crímenes que no han sido especificados.

En respuesta a la preocupación paterna, se remarcó que Bianca no solo mantuvo su autonomía frente al rapero, sino que también ha sabido manejar su nueva posición de influencia. Una fuente cercana a la pareja aseguró que Bianca está haciendo inversiones inteligentes dentro de su matrimonio y que asumió roles significativos en los negocios de Kanye, incluido el desarrollo arquitectónico de la marca Yeezy desde noviembre de 2020 y la gestión de Oxpaha LLC, fundada por Kanye en octubre de 2023.
“Ella tiene mucho invertido en su matrimonio con Kanye y su plan de juego está empezando a ser evidente”, detalló un insider.
Pese a la controversia en torno a sus elecciones de vestimenta, los allegados a Bianca subrayan su inteligencia y determinación para aprovechar su momento de notoriedad pública. “Ella sabe que este es su minuto y que su minuto no durará para siempre”, señaló una fuente, destacando la visión estratégica de la arquitecta en medio del escrutinio.

Now, it appears that her father, Leo, is stepping in and wants to hash things out with Ye.
“Kanye has been invited to go to Australia, and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react,” Daily Mail reported on Thursday, March 21. “Her dad still plans to have a sit-down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye’s power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits.”
According to the outlet’s source, the 29-year-old architect’s dad doesn’t appreciate the risqué outfits she’s been photographed wearing. Some of the most notable fashion pieces have been see-through ensembles, braless tops and mini dresses.

The outlet also reported that Bianca’s mother, Alexandra, recently visited Bianca and felt that Ye has an “intimidating” demeanor.
“Bianca’s mom had to see for herself after Bianca told her family she has this under control,” the insider explained. “This has been a wonderful opportunity for Alexandra to get to spend time with Bianca and assess the situation for herself.”
The source also claimed that Alexandra believed that she could “save her daughter” from her current situation, but “this is not the case.”

“Kanye has started to turn things around since the release of Vultures in the sense that he is not going off on as many unhinged rants,” the source pointed out, referring to Ye’s past social media activity. “He also knows how to sweet talk a mom.”
Nevertheless, Daily Mail reported that Bianca’s dad was “not necessarily pleased with his wife’s visit to see their daughter because he feels like she enabled Bianca to continue doing what she is doing.”
“Yes, Bianca dressed provocatively while her mother was there, but it was nothing in comparison to some of the outfits she has worn prior to and since the visit,” the insider continued, noting that Bianca is “hesitant” to deal with her father’s alleged frustration over the situation.

Kanye West Films Bianca Censori On Massive Bed That Has Fans Thinking Back To This Iconic Video,"Kanye West has been busy with his rollout for Vultures. Overall, the first part of the Vultures trilogy has arrived, however, fans are still waiting on part two. Moreover, there is going to be a part three, but it is up in the air as to when that will be coming out. In the midst of all of this, Ye has been hanging out with his wife Bianca Censori. The two have actually caused quite the stir recently due to the fact that Censori is always wearing some sort of provocative outfit. This is always done in public, and not everyone is a fan of these antics.
Recently, Kanye West took to his Instagram account where he posted a video of Censori. In the clip below, you can see how she is laid out on a massive bed while on her phone. She is wearing white clothing, and the video is being taken from an angle above. As many noted in the comments section, the bed is very familiar. That is because it looks a lot like the massive bed Ye used in the ""Famous"" video almost a decade ago.

Bianca Censori’s worried father has once again expressed concerns over his daughter’s risqué outfits.
Leo Censori, whose brother is a notorious gangland killer, has demanded his daughter and her controversial husband, rapper Kanye West, fly out to Australia to meet with him, Daily Mail reported.
The architect’s dad last month said he wanted to confront the “Jesus Walks” hitmaker over fears he is tearing his daughter away from her family and turning her into a “trashy commodity.”

Now, sources close to Leo say his daughter is “hesitant” to meet with him.
“Kanye has been invited to go to Australia and Bianca is hesitant to allow this to happen because she knows how her father will react,” a source told the outlet.
“Her dad still plans to have a sit down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye’s power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits.”
It comes after insiders told the outlet that Bianca’s mother, Alexandra, flew out to the US to “save” her from her current situation, but seemingly failed to be heard once she arrived.
“Bianca’s father was not necessarily pleased with his wife’s visit to see their daughter because he feels like she enabled Bianca to continue doing what she is doing,” a source said.

Kanye West Is Looking For International Plots With a Whopping $30M Budget to Hold Music Events,"Kanye West is continuously facing rejections when it comes to finding the right venue to hold listening parties for his latest hit Vultures 1 album. The Donda rapper's controversial anti-Semitic comments have drawn negative reactions from European and South American event-holders.
Hence, with a whopping $30 million budget, West is researching locations abroad to organize his events. ""I have been working in this business for more than 20 years and It’s the first time I received this kind of request,"" a real estate agent exclusively told The US Sun. West is potentially scouting sites in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Morocco.
Kanye West says The United Center is the only arena available to him in the last year to perform and asks for help getting other venues.
“I have not been allowed to perform in a year. Feels like the Elvis Presley movie.”pic.twitter.com/K0OpT2it70 — XXL Magazine (@XXL) February 7, 2024
""We were informed that the budget would be a maximum of $30 million. You can buy pretty much whatever you want here with this kind of money."" ""Kanye has a ton of fans, millions of followers, and having him buy real properties or land in one of those countries will bring tons of money to the local economy,"" the source added. ""Just imagine if he buys land in Morocco and has 200,000 fans coming to his concerts there, it will generate so much interest and money for the region.
There are many opportunities and people showed him and his team some great land options and very large real properties. Investing in Morocco would be a fantastic option for his concerts.""

The regions of Tuscany and Calabria in Italy, Castilla and Andalusia in Spain, and Alentejo and Algarve in Portugal are also among those being considered by Ye's team. ""I know that he is struggling to find venues for his shows, and it’s an alternative for him and his millions of fans,"" a Portuguese-based property consultant revealed, who believes it will be a ""very long process"" to bring the plan to life. ""It's an interesting and smart idea."" Meanwhile, the consistently lewd photos of his wife Biana Censori haven't done anything to mend fences or lessen the harm to his reputation. Similar responses were received throughout Asia, Australia, and the Middle East, despite his unsuccessful attempts to secure gigs in Milan, Berlin, Cologne, and Munich.
West is all set to invest in properties ""in the middle of nowhere"" and host his mini-festivals but is being avoided by promoters due to his recent controversial image. The Bound 2 rapper's idea is to bank on performances with Ty Dolla $ign, who features on his top-charting album Vultures 1, and also be able to control the entire process of organizing an event overseas.
As per Complex, West had earlier put out a short clip requesting fans to scout venues for him, ""It's the only arena that I had access to in the past year. And when I call, people say there's no [availabilities] for me, and you know why that is. So if there's anybody out there that can help with this, please do."" ""I have not been allowed to perform in a year,"" he wrote in all caps. ""Feels like the Elvis Presley movie.""",2024-03-22T10:17:29Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Οι γυμνές εμφανίσεις της Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι με τον Kanye West που σόκαραν και τον πατέρα της -Απαίτησε συνάντηση,"Η Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι και ο Kanye West είναι ένα από τα πιο αμφιλεγόμενα ζευγάρια της σόουμπιζ με τις εμφανίσεις τους, δημόσιες και μη, να προκαλούν πάντα αντιδράσεις και ποικίλα σχόλια.
Από τότε που ο γνωστός ράπερ παντρεύτηκε την Αυστραλιανή αρχιτεκτόνισσα το 2022, ένα μήνα μετά το διαζύγιό του με την Κιμ Καρντάσιαν (με πολλούς να την θεωρούν σωσία της πρώην του), είναι συνεχώς στο επίκεντρο δημοσιευμάτων και όχι για καλό λόγο.
ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ
Η 29χρονη γυναίκα κάνει από τότε συνεχώς αποκαλυπτικές δημόσιες εμφανίσεις, με τη μία να είναι πιο γυμνή και αποκαλυπτική από την άλλη, σοκάροντας το κοινό αλλά και προκαλώντας ερωτηματικά για την στάση της.
Οι φωτογραφίες της χωρίς σουτιέν και εσώρουχα, αλλά πολλές φορές και χωρίς... ρούχα, όπως εκείνη όπου κρατούσε μόνο ένα μαξιλάρι κρύβοντας το στήθος της, έχουν κάνει τον γύρο του κόσμου.
ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ
Μάλιστα, ο «Ye» δεν διστάζει να ποστάρει γυμνές φωτογραφίες της συζύγου του στο Instagram, παρά την κατακραυγή.﻿
ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ
Ακόμη, όταν το ζευγάρι βρέθηκε στη Βενετία το περασμένο καλοκαίρι, προκάλεσαν καθώς επιδόθηκαν σε σεξουαλικές πράξεις δημοσίως, κάνοντας την πόλη να τους απαγορεύσει να την επισκεφθούν ξανά.
Αντιδράσεις και ανησυχία από φίλους και οικογένεια της Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι
Σαν να μην έφτανε αυτό, πολλοί φίλοι και συγγενείς της νεαρής γυναίκας, που την βλέπουν να έχει αλλάξει εντελώς εμφάνιση και συμπεριφορά, έχουν εκφράσει τις ανησυχίες τους για την ψυχική της υγεία.
ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ
Λένε, μάλιστα, ότι ο Kanye West είναι αυτός που την πιέζει να φορά στενά, αποκαλυπτικά ρούχα και να κυκλοφορεί ημίγυμνη δημοσίως, ενώ φαίνεται να την χειραγωγεί.
Δημοσιεύματα υπήρξαν, ακόμη, σύμφωνα με τα οποία της απαγορεύει να χρησιμοποιεί τα social media ενώ τις επιβάλλει τι να φορά, τι να τρώει και πώς να συμπεριφέρεται.

Παίρνει μέτρα ο πατέρας της Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι
Ο πατέρας της Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι, Λίο, έχει σκοπό να αντιμετωπίσει τον γαμπρό του, σύμφωνα με την Daily Mail.
Ο Kanye West καλείται να περάσει χρόνο με τον πατέρα της συζύγου του στην Αυστραλία, σύμφωνα με πηγές, οι οποίες ισχυρίζονται ότι η αρχιτέκτονας «διστάζει» να αντιμετωπίσει την οργή του μπαμπά της για τα σχεδόν γυμνά ρούχα της και την αμφιλεγόμενη σχέση της με τον γνωστό ράπερ.
Τώρα, ο Λίο φέρεται να ζήτησε από τον Kanye να πετάξει για να τον συναντήσει στην Αυστραλία, αφού η σύζυγός του εξέφρασε φόβους για την «εκφοβιστική» συμπεριφορά του όταν επισκέφτηκε νωρίτερα αυτόν τον μήνα.
ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ
«Ο Kanye έχει προσκληθεί να πάει στην Αυστραλία και η Μπιάνκα διστάζει να επιτρέψει να συμβεί αυτό γιατί ξέρει πώς θα αντιδράσει ο πατέρας της», είπε μια πηγή στην Daily Mail.
«Ο μπαμπάς της εξακολουθεί να σχεδιάζει να καθίσει με τον Kanye και δεν θα πτοηθεί από τη δύναμη ή τον έλεγχο του. Κανείς δεν περιμένει ότι όλα αυτά θα είναι ουράνια τόξα και οικογενειακά πορτρέτα», πρόσθεσε.
Η επίσκεψη της μητέρας της και ο καθησυχασμός από την Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι
Το αίτημα του πατέντα έρχεται αφότου η μητέρα της Μπιάνκα, Αλεξάντρα, πέταξε στις ΗΠΑ με σκοπό να «σώσει» το παιδί της, αλλά φαινομενικά απέτυχε.
ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ
«Ο πατέρας της Μπιάνκα δεν ήταν ευχαριστημένος με την επίσκεψη της συζύγου του για να δει την κόρη τους, επειδή αισθάνεται ότι έδωσε τη δυνατότητα στην Μπιάνκα να συνεχίσει να κάνει αυτό που κάνει», συνέχισε η πηγή.
«Ναι, η Μπιάνκα ντύθηκε προκλητικά όσο η μητέρα της ήταν εκεί, αλλά δεν ήταν τίποτα σε σύγκριση με μερικά από τα ρούχα που είχε φορέσει πριν και μετά την επίσκεψη». Από τότε που έφυγε η μητέρα της, η Μπιάνκα έγινε πρωτοσέλιδο με τις προκλητικές της εμφανίσεις.
Ο πατέρας της Μπιάνκα λέγεται ότι ήταν απογοητευμένος από την αδυναμία της Αλεξάντρα να βοηθήσει την κόρη της να δει την επιρροή του Kanye West, με την πηγή να προσθέτει: «Η Αλεξάντρα ήθελε να το κάνει μόνη της και ο πατέρας της είχε την εντύπωση ότι θα της μιλούσε για το πώς παρουσιάζει τον εαυτό της.
ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ
«Την τράβηξε τόσο η προσοχή και η φήμη όλων αυτών που τρομοκρατήθηκε ελαφρώς από την επιρροή του Kanye». Νωρίτερα αυτό το μήνα η Αλεξάντρα φέρεται να πέταξε στις ΗΠΑ «για να δει μόνη της» αν η κόρη της έχει τον έλεγχο της ζωής της.
Η επίσκεψη της Αλεξάντρα ήρθε μέρες αφότου πηγές είπαν στην Daily Mail ότι η Μπιάνκα είχε καθησυχάσει τα αγαπημένα της πρόσωπα ότι δεν εξαναγκάζεται από τον σύζυγό της όπως πολλοί φοβήθηκαν.
«Η Μπιάνκα έχει μιλήσει με την οικογένειά της και έχει πει το ίδιο πράγμα στους φίλους της από την τελευταία φορά που επέστρεψε στο σπίτι, δηλαδή ότι ξέρει τι κάνει και το έχει υπό έλεγχο», είπαν οι πηγές.

Ενώ πολλοί πιστεύουν ότι η ανερχόμενη σταρ της μόδας έχει γίνει απλώς η «σύζυγος-τρόπαιο» του βραβευμένου με Grammy ράπερ, η ίδια είναι εδώ και καιρό μια γυναίκα που συνεργάζεται με τον Kanye για να χτίσει την αυτοκρατορία του.

"When Kim Kardashian Said She Was Naked When Donald Trump Called Her: ""Get Me a Robe...""","Kim Kardashian was undressed when ex-president Donald Trump called her back in 2018. The Kardashians star recalled the behind-the-scenes of a ""nearly nude"" shoot when the Republican candidate rang her up. On the late-night show Jimmy Kimmel Live, the 43-year-old shared her first-time experience discussing politics and a call with a politician of Trump's stature.
Image Source: Getty Images | Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris
The billionaire recounted, ""I was at a Steven Klein photo shoot, and if anyone knows who he is, it's pretty much a nude shoot. So I am naked, and my phone rings and I'm all glammed up,"" telling the host Jimmy Kimmel on an episode aired on July 30, 2018. Kardashian panicked after she regained the call's gravity, ""I'm like, 'Get me a robe,'"" per PEOPLE.
The ex-commander-in-chief called the Hulu star on behalf of a 62-year-old great-grandmother, Alice Marie Johnson, to let her know that he's agreed to free the convicted felon who was incarcerated for 22 years for a first-time nonviolent drug offense. The reality star has been advocating for the release on social media.
This is so unfair... https://t.co/W3lPINbQuy — Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) October 26, 2017
Meanwhile, the beauty mogul continued narrating the phone call incident, ""I put a robe on and I was kinda bugging out during the shoot because I'm like 'Oh, my God, all these amazing things are happening,'"" adding that she couldn't have let the phone call stop her from doing her job, that is being naked in front of the camera, ""I'm still gonna be me.""
Kimmel, on the other hand, found humor in the situation and quizzed Kardashian if she told Trump about her ""nakedness."" She responded with a ""No,"" so the host quipped that had the 77-year-old known she was nude on the other side of the call, he'd have released every inmate of the Alabama prison, ""The gates would have swung open,"" the host laughed.
The SKIMS mogul said after finishing the shoot, she dialed Johnson to inform her about her freedom, ""I didn't know that I was the first person telling her. They had called her up, and she thought it was her daily or weekly attorney call,"" she explained, adding, ""I broke the news to her, and it was just crying. I was at this photo shoot, and I'm, like, trying to not cry my makeup off. It was really emotional.""
Although Kardashian kept her answers diplomatic, escaping controversy. But, Kimmel revealed, ""I know you're not necessarily a Trump supporter, but your husband, Kanye, seems to like him a lot."" Kanye West and Kardashian were happily married at the time. She nodded in agreement and said, ""Yeah.""
""I think he really [does],"" the mother of four explained. ""I always respect what [another] person thinks, and to make it clear … he doesn't necessarily agree with [Trump's] policies, but he likes his personality and how he made it to be president when everyone really underestimated him.""

De fait, le rappeur a partagé un cliché de la jeune australienne de 29 ans, allongée sur un lit en lingerie. Une tenue en dentelle blanche, accompagnée de talons aiguilles blancs également. D’ailleurs c’est la seule chose que nous voyons sur l’image, puisque son visage est recouvert et caché par son téléphone. Sur cette vidéo, les internautes affirment entendre Bianca Censori respirer.

C’est d’ailleurs pour cette raison que cette publication de Kanye West a beaucoup fait réagir sur la toile. Non seulement pour son côté mystérieux, mais aussi pour la tenue de Bianca Censori, qui intrigue les internautes. Ainsi, en commentaires, nous pouvons lire : « Pourquoi elle a plus de vêtements dans un lit que lorsqu’elle sort ? », « Avec tout le respect, je n’ai aucune idée de ce que veut dire ce post », « Elle est habillée ! ». Ou encore : « Au moins elle est habillée », « Le lit est tellement grand ! », « Ça ressemble au début d’un film porno », « Le lit est plus grand que ma maison ». Visiblement, Kanye West a l’art de faire parler… Quoi qu’il en soit, cette fois-ci, Bianca Censori ne s’affiche pas totalement nue… Contrairement aux derniers jours.
Bianca Censori manipulée par Kanye West ?
Malgré tout, ils sont très nombreux à s’inquiéter pour Bianca Censori face aux tenues osées qu’elle a pu porter.

L’australienne apparaissant souvent le visage triste et démuni, plusieurs fans se sont rapidement demandés si elle était réellement heureuse dans les bras du rappeur, qu’ils accusent de la manipuler. « Pourquoi lui fait-il faire cela ? Qu’est-ce qui ne va pas chez elle ? Pourquoi lui permet-elle de la contrôler ? L’argent ? C’est vraiment bizarre », « Ça fait peur que Kanye West ait des filles… », « Honnêtement, c’est juste horrible », « C’est lui qui la fait s’habiller comme ça », peut-on notamment lire sur la toile.

Entnervt: Bianca Censoris Vater zitiert Kanye West zu sich,"Im Dezember 2022 gaben sich Kanye West (46) und Bianca Censori (29) das Jawort. Seither sorgt ihre Beziehung für reichlich Gesprächsstoff! Besonders Biancas sehr freizügige Outfits, die womöglich ihr Ehemann für sie aussucht, stehen immer wieder im Fokus der Kritiker. Auch die Eltern der australischen Architektin äußerten in der Vergangenheit schon mehrfach große Bedenken. Da ihre zahlreichen Interventionen bisher offenbar ins Leere liefen, hat Biancas Vater Leo Censori jetzt wohl genug! Er fordert Kanye auf, zu ihm nach Australien zu kommen, wie ein Insider gegenüber Daily Mail verrät. ""Ihr Vater hat vor, ein ernstes Wort mit Kanye zu reden. Leo wird sich nicht von Kanyes Erfolg einschüchtern lassen und ihm die Stirn bieten"", so die Quelle. Das Model habe jedoch große Angst vor dem Besuch. ""Sie weiß, wie ihr Vater reagieren wird"", ist sich der Insider sicher.
Für Leos großen Wunsch, sich den US-amerikanischen Rapper vorzuknöpfen, scheint es einen konkreten Auslöser zu geben. Kürzlich besuchte nämlich seine Frau Alexandra Bianca in Los Angeles. ""Sie glaubte insgeheim, ihre Tochter während des Besuchs umstimmen und 'retten' zu können"", verrät ein Informant gegenüber Daily Mail. Scheinbar konnte sie jedoch nicht zu dem Paar durchdringen. Denn kurz nach ihrer Abreise sorgte die Architektin erneut mit ihrer Freizügigkeit für Schlagzeilen. Von Alexandras fehlgeschlagenem Versuch soll Leo sehr enttäuscht sein. Er will die Dinge nun selbst in die Hand nehmen, gibt die interne Quelle preis.
Biancas freizügige Looks sorgen jedoch nicht nur bei ihren Eltern für Bedenken. Auch Kanyes Ex-Frau Kim Kardashian (43) soll von den Outfits der Australierin nicht begeistert sein. Besonders, wenn es um die vier gemeinsamen Kinder aus ihrer vorherigen Ehe geht, sei ihr die Nacktheit von Kanyes neuer Partnerin ein Dorn im Auge. ""Kim hat Kanye angewiesen, dass Bianca sich niemals in der Nähe ihrer Kinder so kleiden darf"", plauderte ein Insider gegenüber dem Medium aus.

Making the Cheesecake Factory their runway.
Bianca Censori stepped out in yet another scandalous look Wednesday while on a lunch date with husband Kanye West at the popular eaterie for the second time this week.
The couple walked arm-in-arm as they made their way inside the West Hollywood location, with the “Heartless” rapper flashing his titanium teeth as they erupted in laughter.

Despite dining at the family-friendly restaurant, the former Yeezy architect left little to the imagination, using a pair of completely sheer nude tights as a top.
Censori, who went braless underneath the low-cut garb, completed her look with micro gray Prada shorts ($825), white pointed-toe heels and a black purse.
The 29-year-old kept her short tresses slicked back and added a pop of color to her outfit with a swipe of blue eyeshadow.
The 46-year-old rapper, for his part, donned his typical baggy, all-black outfit and a pair of dark sunglasses.

Just two days prior, the pair visited the same Cheesecake Factory location inside The Grove in equally eyebrow-raising outfits.
Censori — for once — used a pair of tights for their actual purpose, wearing ultra-low-rise green leggings on her bottom half and a barely-there tan bandeau across her chest.
The fluorescent tights were pulled down low enough to see the top of the Australian beauty’s backside. West was even seen constantly readjusting the leggings, pulling them even lower as the two waited for an elevator.

West has been dressing his wife in varying X-rated looks since they tied the knot in December 2022. However, Censori’s family is reportedly fuming over the change in her wardrobe.
Earlier this month, the Daily Mail reported that Bianca’s father, Leo Censori, wanted to confront the controversial rapper over his daughter’s new “trashy” style.

“Bianca’s father, Leo, wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” a source close to Bianca told the outlet.
Leo reportedly wanted to flip the tables on West and ask how the father of four would feel if his daughters — North, 10, and Chicago, 6 — “were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.”
“He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife,” they added.

West, who shares his children with ex Kim Kardashian, has a long history of dressing the women he dates. However, Censori has noticeably been dressed in less clothing than the others.
“No man should ever encourage the woman that he loves to walk out in public and present herself like this. That isn’t love. That is control.”
Despite her family’s concern, Censori has continued stepping out in provocative clothing, from butt-baring metallic mini nanoskirts to completely sheer catsuits with nothing underneath.",2024-03-21T20:41:38Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
Kanye West Buys Bianca Censori A Brand New Porsche,"Kanye West and his model wife Bianca Censori have seemingly been completely inseparable for the better part of a year now. It dates back to when they were causing controversy in Europe for her scantily clad outfits, something she's continued since the pair returned to the US. She was also present during the rapper's recent Rolling Loud VULTURES listening party. She was spotted backstage hanging out with Kim Kardashian, though things seemed surprisingly okay between the pair.
Now, a new video is making the rounds online. In the clip a fan appears to have captured the rapper buying his wife a brand new Porsche. The clip they shared sees the two having a conversation with a dealer and Bianca sitting in the drivers seat of one of the cars. The video was shared to Twitter by the Donda Times Kanye West fan page which also confirms that they went through with the purchase of a new car. Check out the full video below.

Earlier this year Kanye West released his new album VULTURES 1. It was supposedly the first part of a trilogy of volumes of VULTURES albums, though the second part didn't arrive on its originally announced release date. Despite that, some behind-the-scenes previews have shown that West is still hard at work on recording new material.
Bianca Censori has also repeatedly drawn attention for her outfits. Most recently she was dressed pretty skimpy for a lunchtime Cheesecake Factory date with West earlier this week. Before that she went with an almost completely see-through look while out and about earlier this week. She seems to be purposefully attempting to push the boundaries of how revealing her looks can be with each new fit. What do you think of Kanye West buying Bianca Censori a new Porsche? Do you think West will follow up on his promise and release three entire VULTURES albums this year? Let us know in the comment section below.

Kanye West seemingly reacts to the concerns raised by Bianca Censori's father, Leo Censori, over her inappropriate dressing.
For the unversed, the rapper recently shared a controversial video featuring the Australian beauty lying in an all-white giant bed wearing an all-white lacey jumpsuit.
Speaking of the Yeezy founder's move, body language expert Judi James told The Mirror that Kanye showcased his wife in a 'bridal looking state.'
While analysing the all-white bed sheet and pillows, the expert said they are ""so dazzlingly pristine white that it looks as though they have been untouched and un-slept on.""
Judi also shared that Kanye clearly gave ""some se**** messaging"" here as the husband who films his wife not only lying in a ""bridal-looking state on the marital bed but also ignoring her husband as she plays with her phone while he films her.""
The expert speculated that with this short video clip of Bianca, Kanye may be ""trying to prove to her parents that the other shocking looks are just ‘showbiz’ and this is more like the heart of their relationship.""",2024-03-21T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

The father of Bianca Censori is eager to meet Kanye West.
The Australian architect is ""hesitant,"" according to sources cited by Daily Mail, to meet her father Leo, who has regularly criticised her for her daring wardrobe choices and contentious marriage to the rapper.
Kanye's father-in-law now desires a face-to-face confrontation with him.
Leo's wife reportedly voiced worries about Kanye's ""intimidating"" behaviour during a visit earlier this month, prompting Leo to reportedly demand that he travel overseas to meet him in Australia.
Alexandra, Bianca's mother, travelled to the US lately in an attempt to ""rescue"" her daughter, but she never got in touch with them.
“Bianca's father was not necessarily pleased with his wife's visit to see their daughter because he feels like she enabled Bianca to continue doing what she was doing. Yes, Bianca dressed provocatively while her mother was there, but it was nothing in comparison to some of the outfits she has worn prior to and since the visit,” the insider claimed.
According to an informant who spoke to Daily Mail, Bianca is ""apprehensive"" about the I Wonder hitmaker's invitation to Australia since she knows how her father will respond.
“Her dad still plans to have a sit down with Kanye, and Leo will not be intimidated by Kanye's power or control. No one is expecting this to be all rainbows and family portraits,” they stated.",2024-03-21T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Kim Kardashian ends feud with Bianca Censori for a special cause,"File Footage
Kim Kardashian seemingly wants to build an amicable relationship with her ex-husband Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori for the rapper and her children.
For the unversed, the ex-wife of the rapper was recently photographed enjoying with his present partner at the listening party for Kanye's new album Vultures.
Speaking of this unexpected union, relationship expert Louella Alderson told The Mirror that ""it's in everyone's best interest to get along for the sake of the children.""
The expert added, ""Based on their public appearances together, it seems like Kim and Bianca have an amicable relationship. It's unlikely that they would ever be really close friends, given the circumstances of their connection through Kanye.""
Louella believes that initially, it could've been difficult for the Skims founder and her kids to accept Bianca as a permanent part of their lives, especially soon after her messy divorce from the Yeezy founder.
However, Kim, Kanye and Bianca are now putting their differences aside and creating a harmonious co-parenting dynamic.
The expert shared that their latest public appearance ""indicates that they put their children's needs first.""
For the unversed, Kim was married to Kanye for ten years. However, the two parted ways in 2021.

The Sun can exclusively reveal that rapper and designer Kanye, 46, has decided he wants to dethrone Kim in the shapewear market which is why he's had Bianca, 29, modelling outrageously revealing outfits lately.
An insider told us: ""Kanye is seething about how successful SKIMS is - he wants to take Kim on with his own brand, but wants it to be riskier, sexier and make more money than SKIMS.
""He’s putting Bianca in these outfits as a sort of test - she’s his muse and will model the line, he thinks she can showcase his brand and it’ll sell out.
""That’s why he’s parading her around in these outfits to take revenge on Kim.""
Kanye and Bianca, who married in December 2022, have been making headlines with their increasingly x-rated public appearances.
And 29-year-old Bianca is seemingly wearing less and less with every outing.
Recent reports have claimed Bianca's family in Australia are concerned that the model is being forced to parade herself in the revealing outfits.
However it was recently claimed that Bianca is more than on board with Kanye's plans.
PR Guru Mark Borkowski told Dailymail.com: ""Kanye understands outrage and is trying to break the Internet.
""I think a lot of people are starting to feel rather uncomfortable, despite everything he's said, about that he feels he can do whatever he wants with his partner.

Bianca Censori Turns Heads With See-Through Outfit On Cheesecake Factory Lunch Date With Kanye West,"Ye and Bianca Censori were walking around L.A. and got hungry, and what better place to fix the munchies than a Cheesecake Factory? Moreover, it's always funny to see celebrities hit the popular spot up, and it wouldn't be the first time that the couple was spotted there. On Wednesday (March 20) in The Grove, they strolled through streets on their way to the locale and got the attention of plenty of passerby and paparazzi. The Chicago rapper donned a characteristic all-black fit with sunglasses, although he didn't cover up his face as he often likes to do for the cameras. On the other hand, the architect wore a nude-colored bodysuit with pulled-up grey shorts and small heels.
While they tried to get into Cheesecake Factory before their 11:30 AM opening time, Ye made some calls to get inside and security ushered paparazzi and onlookers away. Of course, pop culture's interest in the couple's every move (and fashion choice) has been pretty cemented for over a year now. While it hasn't been without its fair share of new controversies on top of dealing with old ones, they seem in a much more measured and tranquil place now. After all, novelty wears off with time, something that they might be appreciative of to a certain extent.

Meanwhile, this follows Ye's recent relationship comments which had fans wondering who he referred to. ""If you have to ask someone for something more than three times, then you're asking the wrong person,"" he posted on his Instagram Story. Sure, this has nothing to do directly with a romantic bond, and many interpreted this message as relating to his business moves and his wider career. But it's curious to think about whether this says something about a deeper relationship dynamic, as far-fetched as it likely is.
Also, with another Vultures listening party at the Pyramid of Djoser, it seems like this album series rollout is still in the cards. The second installment hasn't come out yet, but it's a Yeezy affair: things were obviously never going to be simple. We'll see where this takes the couple in the near future. Still, check out the video of them hitting up a Cheesecake Factory with the ""Via"" link below. Stay logged into HNHH for the latest news and updates on Ye and Bianca Censori.

Is Bianca Censori's Mom Really Worried About Her Safety? She Traveled Thousands Of Miles To Be With Her Daughter And Kanye,"The relationship between Kanye West and Bianca Censori may only be a bit over a year old, but there’s been no shortage of talk about the couple, namely for the number of outrageous outfits the Yeezy architectural designer has worn in public, including one that exposed her genitals and could lead to a fine or even jail time . The body-baring looks have led to rumors and concerns that West might be controlling his new wife , and now that Censori’s mom has traveled thousands of miles to be with her, some are questioning if she’s really worried about her daughter’s safety.
What Are Reports Saying About Bianca Censori’s Mom Traveling Thousands Of Miles To See Her And Kanye West?
A new report from the Daily Mail has revealed that Bianca Censori’s mom, Alexandra, traveled from her home in Australia to visit her newlywed daughter and her husband, Kanye West, just last week. An unnamed source has told the outlet that the elder Censori made the trip to see whether or not Bianca actually needed “saving” from Ye’s influence, adding:
Bianca's mom had to see for herself after Bianca told her family she has this under control. This has been a wonderful opportunity for Alexandra to get to spend time with Bianca and assess the situation for herself.
Censori is from Australia, where her mother still resides, so it must be difficult for her to see that Bianca has changed her style so drastically since marrying West in a secret ceremony in December 2022, one month after his divorce from Kim Kardashian was finalized. On top of that, there have been a number of rumors about why she’s been seen out wearing things such as a quirky condom-like body covering and some ultra-low cut neon green tights and a tube top, and supposedly engaging in lewd public behavior with her hubby that got them banned from a water taxi in Italy .
As mentioned above, many believe that West is controlling pretty much everything in his wife’s life now, with him allegedly having “a set of rules” for her that include what she wears, eats, the particulars of her workouts and her not speaking. However, some have said that’s not true, and that Censori does at least have “a lot of say in what she wants to wear.” And, other reports have suggested that all of the clothing choices and intriguing behavior are just to use public “outrage” to keep people talking about the Wests.
While it makes complete sense for a mom to want to go and personally check up on her kid with so many conflicting reports going around about what she’s going through, it’s also not impossible that they just wanted to see each other, especially since they now live so far apart. At any rate, the insider continued, noting that Alexandra’s alleged fears were calmed by her visit:
Right now is a pivotal time and Alexandra was lowkey believing she would come to save her daughter. But this is not the case. Kanye has started to turn things around since the release of Vultures in the sense that he is not going off on as many unhinged rants. He also knows how to sweet talk a mom. This has been, really, a good experience, and everyone is so relieved to see her with Alexandra.
Whether this was just a standard family visit or more of an emergency trip to check up on Censori’s well-being, at least it sounds like things went well and her mom has no immediate fears about her life right now.",2024-03-21T16:28:50Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend

Here’s Why Rapper Kanye West Is Suing His Former Employee YesJulz,"Rapper Kanye West, known for his controversial style, is suing a former employee because they broke a non-disclosure agreement. He is demanding an enormous amount of $8 million from media personality YesJulz, with whom he had collaborated, accusing her of disclosing private information protected by an NDA, per The Sun. The turbulent internal conflict at Yeezy that has been going on for a few days has resulted in several leaked messages and social media swipes between Milo Yiannopoulos, Ye, and YesJulz, per Indy100. Ye even posted an Instagram Story on the million-dollar claim days after YesJulz challenged him and Yiannopoulos to do so.
The history of this dispute begins with West's hiring of YesJulz to help and collaborate on his album, Vultures 1. YesJulz, whose real name is Julieanna Marie Goddard, is an American social media star, entrepreneur, and talent manager who was born on March 2, 1990. Since throwing a party for LeBron James in 2014, YesJulz has become quite popular. She has been spotted with famous people at events like the Grammys and the NBA All-Star Game.

When hired by West, YesJulz's duties included taping live streams for Ye's fan following and keeping a detailed record of the majority of the rollout. But, on March 12, West disclosed that they'd decided to let her go. ""We have decided to no longer have YesJulz involved in the rollout of Vultures 1,"" Kanye posted on his Instagram story. ""All the activity on her page and with our fans in the past few days has been unauthorized.""

West asserted that YesJulz violated a non-disclosure agreement, which is why he is suing his former employee. YesJulz allegedly advised followers to make an app just for Yeezy enthusiasts. According to reports, she continued by describing virtual money users would get and use to make purchases on the app. But the rapper claimed he didn't give his approval to any of these business decisions beforehand.

Following her dismissal, Milo Yiannopoulos, Yeezy's chief of staff, sent YesJulz a dismissal letter with a staggering $7.7 million fine. On his Instagram Stories, Kanye posted a copy of the lawsuit he filed against the talent management. It said, ""Julianne Goddard has repeatedly, intentionally and grossly violated the terms of her Non-Disclosure Agreement with complainants including publicly disclosing corporate sales figures, social media strategies, text messages with Ye and management, release plans for Vultures album and product designs before release.""
This is my life, my livelihood, how i take care of my entire family.
I will never back down.
I never signed that NDA.

Following her dismissal, YesJulz, who denies ever signing an NDA, retaliated on social media by claiming, ""I never wanted work done for free. I wanted to help the fans present their work to Ye. So that he could hire them. Anyone who has ever been in contact with me for as little as 5 minutes knows the last thing I'd ever need to steal, Is an idea.""",2024-03-21T06:56:09Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Ye & Ty Dolla $ign Announce Egyptian Pyramids ‘Vultures’ Show,"Ye — the artist formerly known as Kanye West — and Ty Dolla $ign are taking their talents to Egypt next month.
The rapper announced on Wednesday (March 20) that the next Vultures listening experience will be taking place at the Step Pyramid of Djoser on April 20. The show is set for a tentative start time of 8 p.m. locally in the desert of Saqqara, Egypt. There aren’t any other details regarding the show available at this time, but tickets are currently on sale. If the pair go through with it, Ye and Ty will be some of the first in rap to perform at the pyramids.
Travis Scott attempted to put together a show at Egypt’s nearby Great Pyramid of Giza last summer, but plans were eventually scrapped due to “production issues” after the Egyptian Musicians Syndicate reportedly revoked La Flame’s license to perform, citing “rituals” surrounding his artistic values that they believed contradicted Middle Eastern culture.
“After examining social media opinions and feedback, as well as the news circulating on search engines and social media platforms, which included authenticated images and information about peculiar rituals performed by the star during his performance, contradicting our authentic societal values and traditions, the Syndicate’s president and board of directors have decided to cancel the license issued for hosting this type of concert, which goes against the cultural identity of the Egyptian people,” the Syndicate said at the time.
Trending on Billboard
Scott pushed back against the notion and voiced that his music is meant to “unite” his fans around the globe. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he replied in a statement last year. “My only intent with live performances is to unite people around the world over a shared bond in music.”
Only a few American artists have ever had the chance to perform at the pyramids, including the Grateful Dead in 1978 and Mariah Carey, who brought her five-octave vocal range to the Middle East in 2010.
On the rap side, Russ performed at the Pyramids of Giza in 2022. He’s also been spotted with Ye at various stops throughout the Vultures rollout.
After Ye and Ty Dolla earned a No. 1 album atop the Billboard 200 and “Carnival” topped the Billboard Hot 100, the Vultures duo is rolling into the sequel. However, Vultures 2‘s arrival remains murky after earlier tentative release date in March came and went.

"Kanye West Announces First Of Its Kind ""Vultures"" Listening Party At The Pyramid Of Djoser","Kanye West has always been a visionary when it comes to his music. Overall, he is also a pioneer in how he delivers his music to the masses. A great contemporary example of this is what he did with the Donda live listening parties. These were streamed on Apple Music and gave listeners a glimpse into his process as he attempted to perfect the album. Subsequently, he is doing the same thing with Vultures, although he is substituting a tour for these unique listening party experiences. He is trying to go all the way around the world, and his next location may take some by surprise.
As Ye revealed in his latest Instagram post, he will be taking his talents to Saqqara, Egypt. This new listening party will take place on April 20th of this year, which is exactly one month from now. Moreover, the show will take place in front of the Pyramid of Djoser which is an infamous step pyramid. This is all extremely cool and it will serve as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some fans. However, these kinds of performances can sometimes draw the anger of locals who see the pyramids as sacred ground. That said, exert caution if you plan on buying tickets to the show.

"Nicki Minaj's Barbz Tell Ice Spice To Tread Lightly After Discovering She Submitted A Verse For Kanye West's ""New Body""","As most Kanye West fans know, he has been working tirelessly to get out some version of ""New Body"" for a few years now. However, his attempts have been futile. Nicki Minaj was the original feature alongside Ty Dolla $ign. But last December, the Trinidadian superstar declined to clear her verse. The reasoning behind her decision was that too much time had passed. It led to a passionate response from Ye as he mentioned how supportive he has been throughout her career. However, more life was breathed back into ""New Body"" after some leaked texts from YesJulz revealed that the track was sent to Ice Spice and Doja Cat.
Unfortunately, the hype was short lived as Ice Spice's team said that they would not clear her verse either. That led to Kanye again venting his frustrations via Instagram story. ""ICE SPICE SENT A VERSE IN FOR NEW BODY NOW HER TEAM SAYING WE CAN'T USE IT."" When Ye went on that rant about Nicki, there must have been some animosity from the Barbz fanbase. We say that because Minaj's fans feel that Ice Spice went behind her back by submitting a verse for ""New Body.""

For example, one fan tweeted, ""I hate [that] Ice Spice has shown her hand. Going against the Queen will be the demise of her career. You don't get in the game and make a move like that. It's not about ""being scared."" it's about being loyal to ones that are loyal to you. This is why Nicki is the way she is."" One person did play devil's advocate, ""What if Ice called Nicki and talked about this when she received the request and Nicki gave her blessing 🤷🏾‍♂️""
What are your thoughts on Nicki Minaj's fans attacking Ice Spice for recording a verse for Kanye West's ""New Body?"" Do you think the Barbz are the most ruthless fan base out of any artist?

Bianca Censori Still Hasn't Surpassed Kim Kardashian In This Area,"Bianca Censori is the new wife of Kanye West, and overall, she has made quite the splash as of late. This is mostly due to the wild outfits that she has been wearing. Over the last few months specifically, it has become clear that Censori is a star in her own right. She doesn't need Kanye West to help make headlines for her. Instead, she is able to make them herself. These past few days, she has been ramping up the absurdity of her outfits, and it has led to an increase in headlines, as well as Google Search volume.
With this new rise to stardom, TMZ decided to do some research on whether or not Censori had surpassed Kim Kardashian in popularity. They quickly found out that beating Kim's level of popularity is almost impossible. While Censori has had a massive rise to fame, Kim remains more consistent in the amount of Google searches she receives. In fact, there is only one state in America that looks for Censori more than Kim, and that would be Wyoming. Interesting data sets, indeed.

As per Semrush data, it was also shown that Kardashian had one million searches over an entire year, while Censori had two-thirds as many. Needless to say, Censori is going to have to do a lot more than just wear wild outfits to surpass Kim. At the end of the day, Kim is a billionaire entrepreneur who had a massive head start. Regardless, Censori's career prospects are most definitely promising.

"Bianca Censori, la novia de Kanye West, evoca a su ex, Kim Kardashian, y enciende las alarmas en su familia","La moda de Bianca Censori: un reflejo del estilo de Kim Kardashian según cercanos a la pareja. (Créditos: Grosby/Gettyimages)
En un reciente paseo por las calles de California, Bianca Censori, la esposa de Kanye West, captó la atención de muchos al vestir un atuendo diminuto y que, además, hizo recordar a un antiguo estilo de Kim Kardashian. La diseñadora australiana de 29 años lucía un conjunto formado por un bikini metálico plateado y una minifalda extremadamente corta, revelando más de lo habitual. Este estilo de vestimenta, según fuentes cercanas a la famosa pareja, se ha convertido en una firma de Kanye, quien parece influir significativamente en la moda de su cónyuge.
El rapero y productor estadounidense, conocido por sus innovadoras pero a veces polémicas elecciones, parece estar moldeando el estilo de Censori de una manera que se asimila al de su exesposa, Kim Kardashian. De acuerdo con testimonios cercanos a su entorno, la indumentaria de Bianca parece extraída directamente del guardarropa de la socialité, creando así una fusión de estilos que ha generado conversación entre sus seguidores y críticos por igual.

Vestimenta de Bianca Censori preocupa a sus padres
Además, la preocupación no se limita solo al ámbito público o de las redes sociales, sino que ha llegado a la esfera íntima y familiar de Bianca. Fuentes cercanas a su familia han expresado un creciente malestar ante la transformación y exposición de Bianca, indicando que sus padres están “mortificados” al ver a su hija en looks cada vez más reveladores. “Su familia está tan angustiada por esto porque no la reconocen. Ella no haría esto a menos que estuviera siendo controlada”, reveló un insider, según Daily Mail. Esta situación llevó incluso a poner en práctica una intervención por parte de sus seres queridos, inquietados por los supuestos “modos de control” de West.
En medio de la controversia exacerbada por fotografías que aparecen todos los días en la prensa, la madre de Bianca, Alexandra, voló desde Australia a Los Ángeles con la intención de “salvar” a su hija, buscando comprender mejor las circunstancias y verificar si realmente tiene todo “bajo control” como afirma. Durante su estancia en Estados Unidos, Alexandra parece haber experimentado un cambio en su percepción, gracias, en parte, a las habilidades de West para “halagar a una madre”. “Este ha sido realmente una buena experiencia, y todos están tan aliviados de verla con Alexandra”, comentó otra fuente.

Una cuestión que hace más crítica la situación es el supuesto deseo de Bianca y Kanye de tener hijos juntos, lo que significa que Alexandra busca mantenerse cercana y jugar un rol activo en la vida de los futuros nietos. Mientras tanto, el padre de Bianca, Leo, expresó su deseo de confrontar al rapero sobre la controvertida transformación de su hija y cómo la ha exhibido como un “pony de trofeo” desde que contrajo matrimonio con ella. “Ningún hombre debería alentar a la mujer que ama a salir en público y presentarse de esta manera. Eso no es amor. Eso es control”, expresó angustiado.

Qué piensa Kim Kardashian sobre la actual esposa de Kanye West
Por otro lado, Kim Kardashian, la exesposa de Kanye West que comparte cuatro hijos con el rapero (North, Saint, Chicago y Psalm), se vio a sí misma en una posición de mediadora. Se informó que Kim le pidió a Kanye que le sugiriera a Bianca Censori que se “cubriera” alrededor de los niños, demostrando, tal vez, una preocupación compartida por el bienestar de los menores y el impacto de las controversiales elecciones de vestimenta de Censori: “Kim le dijo a Kanye que nunca dejara que Bianca se vistiera así cerca de sus hijos”, señaló un insider. “Está realmente sorprendida de que Kanye deje que su mujer salga de casa así”.",2024-03-20T14:01:34Z,https://www.infobae.com,infobae

Bianca stripped down and ate an ice cream cone while stepping out in the streets.
She wore a tiny metallic silver bikini top that left little to the imagination.
On the bottom, she wore a matching micro mini-skirt.
The skirt was severely cropped and exposed her bare butt as she wore a tiny thong.
Bianca's hair was slicked back into an up-do and she wore glamorous makeup.
She appeared to look solemn and kept a straight face despite Kanye wrapping his arms around her.
Kanye dressed modestly in an oversized black sweatshirt and matching pants.
The couple are no strangers to exposing Bianca's crazy outfits, which some say is a sign of Kanye trying to control her.
Their most recent outing came after reports that Kanye was trying to win over his mother-in-law.
Bianca's mom has been spotted out with the couple in Los Angeles, California, in recent days amid reports she came to ""save"" Bianca over fears the rapper is controlling her.

Eagle-eyed fans have previously spotted that Bianca wore outfits that resembled Kanye's ex, Kim Kardashian.
Bianca's latest look resembled another outfit of Kim's, which she wore previously in 2022.
Kim donned a metallic silver bikini top with matching leggings.
Some fans previously commented that he could be a sign of control.
""If Kanye is the one that 'revolutionized' Kim’s style, what is his influence doing to Bianca? There are ways to look sexy AND classy without this,"" a fan wrote on a Reddit board about the matching outfits.
Kanye is supposedly trying to sweet-talk Alexandra and doing his best to turn things around after his supposed control.
Family talks
Bianca's big family in Australia have supposedly expressed their fears in recent months after seeing her being paraded around in increasingly revealing and outrageous outfits while out in public with the producer.
""Bianca's mom had to see for herself after Bianca told her family she has this under control,"" an insider told DailyMail.com this week.
""This has been a wonderful opportunity for Alexandra to get to spend time with Bianca and assess the situation for herself.""
""Right now is a pivotal time and Alexandra was lowkey believing she would come to save her daughter. But this is not the case.
Mom's approval
""Kanye has started to turn things around since the release of Vultures in the sense that he is not going off on as many unhinged rants,"" the source continued.
""He also knows how to sweet talk a mom. This has been really a good experience, and everyone is so relieved to see her with Alexandra.""
It's also been claimed that Bianca wants kids with the Touch The Sky rapper, and Alexandra is hoping she can stay close and be involved with any future grandchildren.

"Bianca Censori 'inspired by Kim Kardashian' with latest look, fans say as they spot 'sad' detail in LA with Kanye West","An expert said Bianca might be wearing outlandish outfits on purpose
DOUBLE TAKE Bianca Censori ‘inspired by Kim Kardashian’ with latest look, fans say as they spot ‘sad’ detail in LA with Kanye West
KIM Kardashian has influenced Bianca Censori, as one of her most recent outfits is a doppelganger for one of the Hulu star's previous looks.
Fans were quick to spot the similarities between the pair after Bianca, 29, was seen walking hand in hand with her husband Kanye West, 46, in Los Angeles, California.

Kim's lookalike
In photos taken this week, Bianca wore an unusual outfit that seemed to only include random pieces of underwear.
Her legs were covered in a neon green stocking - similar to one of Kim's previous looks - but she was not wearing underwear.
Bianca's stockings were pulled down on the right side to expose her lower back and rear end.
A nude bandeau bra covered her modesty, but barely, as it too was a suspected size too small.
Kim, 43, and Kanye filed for divorce in 2021 after getting married in 2014 and having four children together.
Since their very public split, the stars have moved on, with Kanye settling down with architect Bianca, and Kim rumoured to be dating NFL star, Odell Beckham Jr.
Bianca accessorized her outfit with a pair of tall patent leather pumps and her cell phone.
Her toned and muscular abs were on full display while showing off her flawless tan.
She was wearing a face full of simple makeup, and her hair was pulled back into a tight and tiny bun at the back of her head.
The rapper stood by her side fully clothed in a baggy black sweatshirt and oversized black pants.

Baby Bun
Bianca and Kanye critics on Reddit got a hold of the photos and tore her outfit apart.
One fan also called Bianca out for copying Kim's signature lowkey hairstyle - the slicked-back bun.
The fan said: ""OK the sad tiny struggle bun is the first thing I’ve seen on her that may be Kim-inspired.""
Other fans wondered about her style and asked: ""My only question is: WHY does she dress like this?
""If Kanye is the one that 'revolutionized' Kim’s style, what is his influence doing to Bianca? There are ways to look sexy AND classy without this.""
""Yeah, they're clearly trolling at this point. Anything for attention I guess,"" another added.
A fan commented: ""You know the outfit is bad when it looks unflattering on someone that hot.""
New game plan
In recent months, Kanye has fans worried that he's forcing Bianca to wear these outrageous outfits.
However, earlier this week it was revealed that his 'controlling' behaviour could be part of a plan to outdo his ex-wife.
Ye and Bianca have stolen headlines after she wore x-rated outfits in public.
There have even been reports that her family has been concerned that she's being forced to wear revealing looks.
Experts weigh in
A PR expert recently claimed that the strange outfits are a publicity strategy to outdo Kim, according to PR Guru Mark Borkowski and the DailyMail.
Mark said: ""Kanye understands outrage and is trying to break the Internet.
""I think a lot of people are starting to feel rather uncomfortable, despite everything he's said, about that he feels he can do whatever he wants with his partner.""
He mentioned that people and brands typically fell into two camps - one that thinks Kanye is controlling and the other that believes Bianca is complicit.

"YesJulz Tired Of ""Misogynistic Yes Men,"" Will Fight Tooth And Nail Against Kanye West In $8 Million Lawsuit","It has been nearly a week since YesJulz, a former promoter for Kanye West and his VULTURES 1 project, was fired. This all went down because the social media influencer was having unauthorized engagements with fans and brands on multiple platforms. On top of that, she never put her signature on the NDA and because of that violation she is being sued for $8 million. This set the internet on fire and came as quite as a surprise. Part of the reason for that is due to Milo Yiannopoulos being Chief of Staff and terminating YesJulz immediately. If you want more information on why Milo is not the most shining figure, read this article here. This led to YesJulz essentially telling Kanye West to send over the lawsuit.
""F*** an NDA. Sue me,"" she wrote on X. They handed that down as we said, but YesJulz is not going down without a fight. According to AllHipHop, she sent out another scathing taking a shot at everyone on the Yeezy staff and almost certainly Milo in particular. ""One thing I wont do is sit here and let a group of d**k riding, misogynist yes men go out of their way to slander my name in an attempt to ruin everything i have worked my a** off to build from scratch over the past decade.""

However, this is far from the last message sent back toward Ye and Milo. ""The audacity for a company ran by someone who posts screen shots to over 20 million people at his leisure, without consent, to attempt to intimidate a former team member with a ridiculous lawsuit with basis claims of over $7million in incurred fees for breaking a doc that was never signed is truly laughable."" Finally, she admitted to taking accountability for being ""blindly loyal to Ye."" But it is not going to take away from the fact how furious she is.

Kanye West calls out Ice Spice’s team for delaying his song ‘New Body’,"Kanye West is not happy with Ice Spice, alleging that her team is holding up the release of his song New Body.
In classic Ye fashion, the 46-year-old rapper took to his Instagram Stories on Tuesday and spilled that the 24-year-old rapper recorded and sent him her verse for a new version of the song, but her team isn’t giving the go-ahead.
“ICE SPICE SENT A VERSE IN FOR NEW BODY NOW HER TEAM IS SAYING WE CAN’T USE IT,” he wrote over a blank white post.
This isn't the first time New Body has faced setbacks.
The track has been a long time in the making, initially intended for Kanye's unreleased album Yandhi back in 2018.
Originally featuring Nicki Minaj, the song was even slated for inclusion on Ye's recent collaborative album Vultures with Ty Dolla Sign, released last month.
However, the Trinidadian rapper, 41, declined to have her verse included in the final version.",2024-03-19T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
"Kanye West Records ""CARNIVAL"" Verse In Room Full Of Friends: Video","When asked about their recording process, some artists insist that they can only work in quiet studios free of all distractions. Kanye West, on the other hand, doesn't mind performing while making his album, as we saw with Vultures 2. The controversial project finds Ty Dolla Sign and Ye further pushing creative boundaries and topping the charts, even with the latter's widespread cancellation through the entertainment industry in recent years.
On Monday (March 18), a video surfaced online showing West in a room surrounded by dozens of friends, many of them seated around them. He had his recording tools set up in front of him, and headphones wrapped around his temples while seemingly nodding along to music blaring out of them. Around him, small talk and chatter continued until he began spitting his provocative bars. ""Now I'm Ye-Kelly, b**ch / Now, I'm Bill Cosby, b**ch,"" the father of four assertively declares. ""Now, I'm Puff Daddy rich / That's 'Me Too' me rich.""

Kanye West's Vultures 2 Recording Process
Along with the NSFW song, Ye and Dolla shared a CGI-generated visual to accompany ""CARNIVAL,"" which showcases a lot of violent imagery. Despite the controversy surrounding the ""Stronger"" hitmaker and his latest LP, his circus-themed track still managed to nab the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 chart earlier this month. He's hinted that at least one more installment of Vultures is coming our way this year, and we're eager to see what his creative process will be for that.
Now that we've filled you in on how Kanye West recorded his verse on ""CARNIVAL,"" you can turn your attention to Ice Spice's rumoured ""New Body"" verse. According to Ye. the New Yorker's team is gatekeeping the music from being released, which doesn't come as a surprise to many considering Spice's working relationship with Nicki Minaj.

"Kanye West Claims Ice Spice's Team Is Blocking Her ""New Body"" Verse","Kanye West has been trying to release the song ""New Body"" for years at this point. Overall, the song has been anticipated since 2018. However, a release has never actually happened. For those who may not know, the original version of the song features Ty Dolla $ign and Nicki Minaj. Considering the fact that Ye and Ty Dolla have collaborative albums on the horizon, it makes sense that this song is back on everyone's mind. In fact, Ye has made numerous strides to get the song released. For instance, a few months back, he was asking Nicki Minaj to clear her verse. Unfortunately, she refused and the song never dropped.
Earlier today, we reported on how YesJulz leaked a text message chain between herself and Ye. It was here where YesJulz revealed that she had actually sent ""New Body"" to both Doja Cat and Ice Spice. This was an absolutely massive reveal that had fans extremely excited. After all, these are two huge women artists, and to have them on a song with Ye would be a lot of fun. Subsequently, around Noon EST today, Kanye confirmed that Ice Spice actually sent a verse back. However, her team is refusing to clear it, and Ye wants some answers.

Cosa c’è dietro il look spinto di Bianca Censori? “Non è succube di Kanye West”,"Los Angeles, 19 marzo 2024 – Kanye West e Bianca Censori sotto la lente dei tabloid .
Il rapporto tra il rapper americano, 46 anni, e la moglie, 29, è sempre stato considerato controverso, a causa degli atteggiamenti assunti in pubblico dai due, che farebbero pensare ad una relazione non equilibrata, all’interno della quale la figura di Kanye sembra essere quella predominante mentre lei viene descritta come “sottomessa”. Ciò che fa più discutere sono gli outfit di Bianca, sempre molto ‘minimal’, per usare un eufemismo, che contrastano con quelli del rapper, coperto dalla testa ai piedi in ogni occasione. Diverse persone hanno mostrato la loro preoccupazione sullo stato della donna, tra cui anche il padre della Censori, che vorrebbe dei chiarimenti dal rapper sulle scelte stilistiche della figlia.
Secondo i retroscenisti, il look spinto di Bianca sarebbe una scelta di Kanye che vorrebbe così oscurare l’immagine dell’ex moglie, Kim Kardashian. Kanye non si è fatto scrupoli a condividere immagini altamente sessualizzate della compagna: un comportamento che stride con quelli assunti in passato. Il rapper, infatti, ha criticato diverse volte Kim Kardashian per essersi ""vestita troppo sexy"" durante il suo periodo come artista gospel.
Secondo l'esperta inglese di linguaggio del corpo, Judi James, l'ultima uscita pubblica della coppia potrebbe rivelerebbe una dinamica diversa. L’apparenza è sempre quella di una relazione ‘maschiocentrica’. Nelle immagini scattate ieri al The Grove (centro commerciale a Los Angeles), Kanye sembra abbassare i leggings trasparenti della moglie per esporre le sue natiche. Eppure – dice James, intervistata da Femail - Bianca mostra “segnali di fiducia e leadership"", mentre Kanye ""sembra più accondiscendente"". Censori sa quello che fa: ""Come una PR professionista – sostiene l’esperta citata da Daily Mail – Bianca sembra essere quella che si occupa degli affari, si avvicina e chiama l'ascensore aspettandone l’arrivo. Anche se si tratta di piccoli gesti, implicano che sia lei a prendere alcune delle loro decisioni, piuttosto che essere semplicemente portata in giro passivamente”. La postura di Bianca suggerirebbe sicurezza, nonostante l’abbigliamento. Se la famiglia di lei teme un condizionamento da parte del marito, secondo James il linguaggio del corpo della coppia in realtà segnala affetto reciproco. ""La loro stretta di mano sembra affettuosa, con le dita intrecciate, e Kanye sembra voler mostrarsi come un gentiluomo vecchio stile con le sue manifestazioni di etichetta"".",2024-03-19T16:15:58Z,https://www.quotidiano.net,QUOTIDIANO.NET

The 29-year-old Yeezy employee also wore a nude-colored bandeau and black high heels for the day out, while Ye donned an all-black outfit.
As Ye and Bianca walked upstairs, the “Jesus Walks” artist appeared to speak with photographers for a moment before he held the door open for his wife, according to a social media video. Later that day, multiple outlets reported that Bianca changed into clear high heels for their date at the Cheesecake Factory.

Last week, Bianca made headlines for appearing alongside Ye’s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, at his Vultures album listening event. While it was unclear whether or not the two women talked, they appeared cordial as they watched the show from behind a barricade.
Over the past year, Bianca has been seen wearing unique and risqué outfits while out and about with Ye. The two have even travelled around the world to attend events together.
The pair — who wed in December 2022 — made headlines for their marriage when a report surfaced claiming that they had broken up due to tensions with Bianca’s family.
“Her family has never been a fan of Ye, and those close to her have questioned whether marrying him was the right decision,” The U.S. Sun reported in November 2023. “He is a very difficult person to be around and work for, and Bianca has been one of the most patient people ever to deal with him. She’s been all about Ye.”
However, Ye and Bianca shut down the split rumors once they were seen together later that year. In fact, the model was photographed carrying Ye and Kim’s daughter Chicago West while on their way to the Vultures launch event in Florida in December 2023.
In addition to Chicago, 5, Kim and Ye share kids North, 10, Saint, 8, and Psalm West, 4.
Ye and Bianca married shortly after he and Kim, 43, finalized their divorce in 2022. The Kardashians star had previously filed for divorce in February 2021, but the “Stronger” artist didn’t make it easy for them to move on from their marriage. From social media rants to publicly referring to Kim as his “wife” throughout 2021, the ex-spouses experienced difficulties in their co-parenting relationship. However, they were declared legally single in March 2022, eight months before they finalized their divorce.",2024-03-19T15:49:49Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife

Bianca Censori Wore Nothing But A Pair Of Neon Green Tights And A Tube Top For Latest Outing With Kanye West,"Kanye West’s wife Bianca Censori has been causing quite a fuss with her fashion options lately, with outfits so risque there’s been talk of a fine or even jail time . As speculation continues over how much say Censori has in her wardrobe or whether Ye is choosing all of her outfits , she was turning heads again on a recent outing with her husband. The couple were photographed on March 18, with Censori sporting nothing but a pair of tights and a small tube top.
The embattled rapper may have declared 2024 the year of “no pants,” but that’s pretty much all his wife was wearing — if we are, indeed, considering tights “pants” — when they stepped out for some business meetings in Beverly Hills on Monday. Bianca Censori put the “casual” in business casual as TMZ obtained photos of her in nothing but low-cut neon green tights and a cleavage-baring pink tube top.
One of the photos appears to show Kanye West adjusting his wife’s hip-hugging nylon bottoms to intentionally show off more of her backside, as he dressed in his typical uniform of a hoodie, baggy jeans and boots — all black, of course. Bianca Censori wore her hair pinned back and completed the ensemble with a pair of black heels.
Following their meetings in Beverly Hills, the couple — who tied the knot in January 2023 — reportedly hit up some shops at The Grove, including the Cheesecake Factory, but the report is unclear if this visit was for business or pleasure.
It seems clear that Bianca Censori intended to draw attention with her outfit, given the bright color and mismatched top. One PR expert shared his thoughts on why Ye styles his wife in revealing outfits , saying it’s his way of ensuring his name stays in the conversation. Kanye West understands the power of public outrage, the expert continued, and he appears to be leaning into that after he got “ beat to a pulp ” and lost millions, if not billions, of dollars after making multiple antisemitic comments.
In the past months we’ve seen Bianca Censori baring it all in see-through and barely there ensembles, and those controversial looks are not the only bizarre fashion choices that involved her husband of over a year. She wore nothing but black body tape while promoting Yeezy last May, with a daring look that drew a lot of praise, including from Kanye West’s ex-girlfriend Julia Fox. Less well-received was a head-to-toe black number a few weeks later that many fans compared to a condom .
Kim Kardashian knows only too well how Kanye West can be when it comes to controlling his partner’s fashion, and while she obviously has no say in the matter regarding Bianca Censori, Kardashian reportedly has a rule that her ex-husband cannot allow Censori to dress in such a revealing way around their four kids. Despite her feelings about Ye’s wife — she reportedly hated Censori for years — the Hulu reality star did recently hang out with her at Ye’s Vultures 1 listening party .

The Yeezy architect, 29, showed off some booty in her fluorescent tights, which she wore pulled down to reveal the top of her derrière — and allowed her husband to adjust, seemingly pulling the back down even further as they waited for the elevator.

Censori wore a tiny nude bandeau top with her tights-only ensemble, baring her toned abs in the outfit.
Although she wore a pair of black pumps for a business meeting earlier in the day, she swapped the high heels for a low pair of clear sandals to get her fill at outdoor mall The Grove.
Censori wore her hair in a slicked-back style and as usual, she wore minimal accessories, going jewelry-free other than a few earrings.

The Australian beauty wore an even more racy outfit over the weekend, sporting a completely sheer black bodysuit with nothing underneath as she headed out with the “Flashing Lights” rapper.
However, Censori covered up in a pretty pink minidress when she headed out for a shopping date with her mom in Los Angeles last week.

Kim Kardashian Had Initiated an Affair With Ex-Husband Kanye West While Dating Reggie Bush,"Kim Kardashian ""manifested"" Kanye West even while still dating her ex Reggie Bush. The rapper and the reality star took wedding vows in May 2014, and the couple were in a two-year courtship prior. However, it was reported that The Kardashians star was fond of Ye and found him attractive while still in a relationship with Bush.

The SKIMS founder has reportedly been sending messages to West during her three-year on-again-off-again relationship with Bush, which finally ended in 2010, as reported by Radar Online. Apparently, she attempted to ""initiate"" the dating process with Ye many times.
A source close to Kardashian revealed, ""Kim attempted several times to initiate an affair with Kanye and even was busted by Reggie for it."" Consequently, it affected their relationship. The insider added, ""It led to a couple of their short-term break-ups."" However, the fashion mogul smartly dodged these allegations of having ""secret encounters"" with the Yeezy owner.

But, the sources close to her confirmed, ""Even Kim herself admits that while she loved Reggie, she was obsessed with Kanye because she found him fashionable and exciting in a way that Reggie just wasn't."" Kardashian had a few run-ins with her ex, but her friends claimed she's over the moon for the Praise God rapper.
The billionaire was smitten by West. ""She is absolutely one-hundred percent not in contact with Reggie, despite crossing paths with him,"" the sources clarified. ""She even lets Kanye look at her phone every night to put his doubts at ease."" But it wasn't just Kardashian who attempted to woo Ye.
Apparently, her baby daddy, too, spent around nine years convincing Kardashian to date him despite being in a committed relationship with Amber Rose. The ""crazy-in-love"" Ye went so far as to put himself next to her in the annual Kardashian/Jenner family Christmas card and sent it to the 42-year-old professing his love, as per Daily Mail.
His excuse was, ""I just dreamed about being next to her."" West's girlfriend at the time, Rose, alleged the ex-couple cheated while they both were in a relationship. The American model accused Kardashian of calling, texting, and sending pictures to West. ""Kim is one of the main reasons why me and Kanye are not together,"" said Rose.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Cut Life (@thecutlife)
""She's a home wrecker! They were both cheating on me and Reggie with each other,"" she added. The 39-year-old even demanded an explanation through an e-mail. ""She was sending pictures, and I was like, 'Kim, just stop. Don't be that person."" However, Rose received no response.
""I thought at least she'd be woman enough to respond to me,"" said Rose. ""She never responded."" The cheating allegations were resuscitated when Myla Sinanaj posted a series of Twitter rants. Her tweets alleged she witnessed West entering Kardashian's suite at 2 AM while she was still with Bush, per Daily Mail.
""I was the one making Kanye keys to her suit at 2 AM!!! Back when she was supposed to be with the love of her life, Reggie Bush, right??"" Sinanaj claimed in 2013. She concluded her rant, ""My advice to Kanye is 'if they cheat with you, they cheat on you.' Remember that sh*t.""

Bianca Censori Dons Barely-There Top & Neon Pants While Out With Kanye West,"Bianca Censori has caused quite a stir thanks to her provocative outfits. Whenever she goes out with Kanye West, you can be sure that she is wearing something truly unique. Overall, these outfits are typically extremely revealing. Furthermore, it has gotten to the point where some people are accusing Ye of parading her around and stripping her of her agency. At this stage, it is impossible to say what is going on. We don't live their lives. However, Censori appears to be doing just fine as she continues to support her husband amid his rollout for Vultures.
Throughout this rollout, the two have been seen out and about in Los Angeles. For instance, according to TMZ, the two were attending some business meetings on Monday. During this run, Ye could be seen wearing a black hoodie and black pants. Meanwhile, Censori had a much more colorful outfit.

"Kanye West Sent ""New Body"" To Ice Spice & Doja Cat, According To Leaked Text Messages With YesJulz","Kanye West has a lot of unreleased songs in his arsenal. Overall, one of the most beloved unreleased Kanye tracks is ""New Body."" This is a song that was supposedly going to drop back in 2018. Moreover, it was going to come with a verse from Nicki Minaj. All of these years later, fans still fantasize about what would happen if this track made its way to streaming services. With Vultures 2 on the horizon, there have been rumors that ""New Body"" could very well be dropping. However, there are no confirmations that this is true. Instead, fans have been forced to hope and pray that things will go their way.
In the midst of all of this, Kanye is looking to sue YesJulz for $8 million. He has accused her of breaking her NDA, and it has led to a huge fallout on social media. YesJulz has begun leaking texts, and her latest leak speaks directly to the ""New Body"" hype. As you will see down below, Julz admits to sending ""New Body"" to both Ice Spice and Doja Cat. Of course, Nicki Minaj is currently refusing to clear her verse, and it seems like Ye wanted to hear other woman artists on it. Whether or not either artist actually sent back a verse, is unknown.

BARING ALL Kanye West’s wife Bianca Censori exposes her butt at family-friendly LA mall as fans ‘can’t believe she wasn’t arrested’
KANYE West's wife Bianca Censori exposed her butt at a family-friendly restaurant in Los Angeles.
The couple, who married in December 2022 following Kanye's divorce from Kim Kardashian in March of the same year, stepped out in the Grove mall.

Bianca ate at the Cheesecake Factory restaurant along with her husband.
The Australian designer wore a revealing outfit that left fans shocked.
Bianca donned a tiny nude strapless bra paired with neon green leggings.
She wore her pants low on her hips, which revealed her butt crack.
Her brunette locks were slicked back into an updo and she went make-up free.
Kanye was completely covered up in a black sweatshirt and baggy pants.
The couple walked around the Californian streets and visited a candy store.
Fans flooded Reddit with outraged comments at Bianca's supposed public indecency.
A user posted photos of Bianca and Kanye on a social media thread.
""Ye and Bianca in Beverly Hills today… this is mental illness,"" they titled the thread.

""Remember when he would police what Kim wore if it were 'too sexy' & 'made him uncomfortable'?"" wrote a fan.
""They’d be kicked out of anywhere else if they weren’t famous,"" added another.
""I still can’t believe she hasn’t been arrested. What she’s wearing here barely counts as underwear. If she weren’t hot and he wasn’t famous, she would be arrested,"" noted a fourth.
""Kanye always dressing like it's winter while displaying his new wife like a walking sex doll,"" said a fifth.
RACY LOOKS
This was not the first time Kanye was criticized for Bianca's outfit.
Kanye's supposedly 'controlling' behavior is allegedly part of a big plan to 'outshine' ex-wife Kim - and Bianca is reportedly fully onboard.
They have been making headlines with their increasingly x-rated public appearances.
Recent reports have claimed Bianca's family in Australia are concerned that the model and Yeezy architect is being forced to parade herself in the revealing outfits.
But a new report has shed some light on what might be really happening.
A PR expert claims that it's all part of the couple's game plan, and they hope to 'break the internet' with Bianca's NSFW looks.
KANYE'S PLAN?
Kanye, 46, is 'copying' the publicity strategy used by his ex-wife but pushing it to the very limit, PR Guru Mark Borkowski told Dailymail.com.
""Kanye understands outrage and is trying to break the Internet,"" Mark said.
""I think a lot of people are starting to feel rather uncomfortable, despite everything he's said, about that he feels he can do whatever he wants with his partner.
""There is a line here drawn between those who believe this is control and those who believe that this woman is complicit and fully involved with this freak show.
""But it is a weird freak show that everybody is engaging with and some are enjoying these quite explicit photos.""

For West’s part, he sported an all-black fit, consisting of a black jacket, pants and shoes.
Censori hasn’t shied away from stepping out in skimpy outfits as her family reportedly fears she is being turned into “trashy commodity” by the “Bound 2” rapper, 46.
Per the Daily Mail, the Austrailian model’s father, Leo Censori, allegedly wants to speak to his son-in-law about his controversial behavior.

“Bianca’s father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” a source told the outlet earlier this month.
“He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.”
The insider continued, “He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife.”

Per the source, Bianca’s family also believes West is distancing his wife from them, adding, “If this isn’t bad enough, the man who is supposed to protect Mr. and Mrs. Censori’s daughter is the same man that is shutting her out from her own family.”
Additionally, Leo believes West is hurting his “beloved daughter” by turning her into a “trashy-looking marketable commodity.”
“No man should ever encourage the woman that he loves to walk out in public and present herself like this. That isn’t love. That is control,” the insider concluded.

"Kanye & North West, Nicki Minaj","A first Thursday night (March 14) show spotlighting a special Vultures performance by ¥$ (Ye + Ty Dolla $ign), plus North West making her debut festival performance, were among the highlights and surprises for fans attending 2024 Rolling Loud California. Holding court for an unprecedented four nights (March 14-17) at Inglewood, Calif.’s Hollywood Park, the annual festival’s stacked deck of headliners also included Nicki Minaj, Post Malone and Future x Metro Boomin.
Just as buzzworthy, however, were the additional acts rounding out Rolling Loud’s three full days of programming. Among them: Bryson Tiller, Sexyy Red, Summer Walker, Flo Milli, PartyNextDoor, Don Toliver and Big Sean, as well as Los Angeles rap legends YG and Tyga in a joint performance.
The first Rolling Loud event of 2024 also presented a wide-ranging collection of merchandise inspired by L.A. sports teams, street art, racing culture, anime, skateboarding and more. Curated by Rolling Loud’s director of merchandise Ray Guilbauilt and primarily designed by Prism Works Group, the merch offerings also included collaborations with YG, marking the rapper’s 10th anniversary of his classic album My Krazy Life; Chief Keef’s Glo Gang; a Rolling Loud co-branded belt by BB Simon; and the fest’s continued partnership with Forever 21 for the popular merch activation Bunny’s Bae Bar.
Those unable to attend in person could tune in each day to Rolling Loud’s livestream on its YouTube channel. Presented by Sprite, the fest’s official livestream was hosted by Jazzy of Jazzy’s World (with whom 10-year-old North West, aka Miss Westie, did her first on-camera interview about her forthcoming debut album Elementary School Dropout), Tallie Spencer, Speedy Morman, Bootleg Kev and Hakeem Rowe, among other personalities.
Approaching its 10th anniversary in 2025, Rolling Loud — co-founded by Matt Zingler and Tariq Cherif — is heading next to Europe this summer (July 5-7, 2024, near Vienna, Austria), coming back Stateside for Rolling Loud Miami (July 19-21) and then returning to Asia with Rolling Loud Thailand (Nov. 22-24).

Kanye West making desperate moves to 'sweet talk' with Bianca Censori's mother,"Kanye West making desperate moves to 'sweet talk' with Bianca Censori's mother
Based on reports, Kanye West is ""sweet talking"" to her wife Bianca Censori's mother in an attempt to ""turn things around.""
Fearing that Bianca is being ""controlled,"" Bianca's mother is said to have gone to the US to ""save"" her daughter from the rapper. He has been inspired by the beauty ever since they first met.
Ever since the 29-year-old Australian married 46-year-old Kanye in December 2022, Bianca's family has not kept their worries to themselves.
According to reports, her father Leo has been eager to speak with the rapper about his daughter's striking outfit since she started dating Kanye.
A source told The DailyMail: ""Bianca's mom had to see for herself after Bianca told her family, she has this under control. This has been a wonderful opportunity for Alexandra to spend time with Bianca and assess the situation for herself.""
It is said that Bianca's mother hurried to ""save"" her daughter. But it seems like Kanye has assisted in assuring her that things are not as they seem.
A source said: ""Kanye has started to turn things around since the release of vultures in the sense that he is not going off on as many unhinged rants."" They added: ""He also knows how to sweet talk a mom.""",2024-03-18T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Nach Kritik von Biancas Papa: Kanye West will sich versöhnen,"Kanye West (46) möchte allem Anschein nach die Wogen zwischen sich und Bianca Censoris (29) Familie glätten! In einem Interview mit Daily Mail erklärt Insider, dass die Schwiegermutter des Rappers zu Besuch gekommen sei, um sich vom Wohl ihrer Tochter zu überzeugen. ""Gerade jetzt ist eine entscheidende Zeit und Alexandra glaubte insgeheim, dass sie kommen würde, um ihre Tochter zu retten. Aber das ist nicht der Fall"", plaudert der Informant aus und fügt hinzu: ""Kanye hat seit der Veröffentlichung von 'Vultures' eine Kehrtwende vollzogen, da er nicht mehr so oft ausrastet. Er weiß auch, wie man eine Mutter umschmeichelt!""
Am vergangenen Mittwoch wurden die 29-Jährige und Kanyes Schwiegermutter gemeinsam gesichtet und seither verbrachte das Mutter-Tochter-Gespann viele gemeinsame Stunden und besuchte unter anderem Kanyes Auftritt beim Rolling Loud Musikfestival. Auf dem Event war sogar die Ex des 46-Jährigen anwesend: Kim Kardashian (43) feierte zusammen mit der Stiefmutter ihrer Kinder. ""Dies war eine wunderbare Gelegenheit für Alexandra, Zeit mit Bianca zu verbringen und sich selbst ein Bild von der Situation zu machen"", enthüllt der Insider gegenüber besagtem Medium und fügt hinzu, dass sich ihre vorherigen Bedenken dank ihres Besuchs verringert haben: ""Diese Woche war für Bianca in Bezug auf ihr Wachstum wirklich sehr wichtig. Sie hatte nicht nur die Möglichkeit, Zeit mit ihrer Mutter zu verbringen, sondern auch mit der Mutter ihrer Stiefkinder.""
Hintergrund des Besuchs scheinen unter anderem die Negativschlagzeilen zu sein, mit denen sich Kanye zuletzt konfrontiert sah. Der Vater des italienischen Models äußerte sich nämlich vor wenigen Wochen zur Beziehung seiner Tochter mit dem Musiker und bezeichnete sie als ""billige Trophäe"" ihres Ehemanns. Daraufhin schätzte eine Expertin die Situation gegenüber der zuvor genannten Zeitschrift ein und befürchtete, dass sich der Streit negativ auf die Beziehung der beiden auswirken könne: ""Es könnte zu Spannungen zwischen Bianca und Kanye führen, wenn sie wegen des öffentlich gemachten Konflikts zwischen ihren Familien in eine unangenehme Lage gebracht werden!"" Dem Konflikt scheint das Paar nun jedoch den Wind aus den Segeln genommen zu haben.

Kanye shared his original take during an interview with Big Boy after his headlining set at Rolling Loud, last week. “I done invented every style of music of the past 20 years, I created this genre. I created Weeknd’s genre, Trav, Drake…I’m gonna go ‘head and say it, with all love, Future and Thug also, because of the autotune album if you think about it,” Ye said.

"Kanye West To Sue YesJulz For $8 Million, She Responds","Kanye West and his rollout for Vultures has certainly been filled with big headlines. Overall, the first Vultures came out a couple of days late, however, some fans felt it was worth the wait. Of course, the track ""Carnival"" ended up going number one in North America, which just goes to show that people are still listening. However, as it pertains to Vultures 2, the project has been delayed quite a bit. At first, it was supposed to drop on March 8th. Although now, it is believed that the album is only going to come out on May 3rd. In the midst of all of this, Ye is under scrutiny for the actions of his Chief Of Staff, Milo Yiannopoulos, who recently accused YesJulz of breaching her NDA.
As we reported last week, YesJulz was fired from the Yeezy team. It was said that she was having unauthorized conversations with Kanye West fan pages. This subsequently led to Milo claiming that YesJulz was on the hook for $7.7 million in unpaid fines. Overall, this was quite the number, but Julz was unbothered. On Twitter, she exposed Milo for the inappropriate language he used while describing Kanye fans. Regardless, it seems like Ye and his team are ready to pursue legal action against her. In the Instagram story below, you can see that Ye is preparing to sue her for $8 million.

As this news broke, YesJulz remained at ease. She subsequently took to Twitter and decided to lash out at Milo as opposed to Ye. ""Lol FUCK MILO Try me you little bitch,"" she wrote. Needless to say, she is not scared of the lawsuit right now. It has not been filed officially, which means there is a chance it won't go through. However, if Ye and his team win, then it will serve as a warning to anyone else who may work for his company in the future.

Kanye West's Limited Edition GAP Clothing Line Worth $1M Stolen From LA Warehouse,"GAP, the clothing company, and Kanye West have a lengthy history of collaboration. The Donda rapper first worked with the fashion label at the age of fifteen, ""When I was working at the Gap at 15, I don't think I had any desire to actually make clothes, but I always felt like that's what I wanted to be around. I loved the fabrics, I loved the colors, I loved the proportions,"" he said in a 2015 interview as reported by The Things. ""Abercrombie [& Fitch] was too expensive for me, and the Gap was too expensive for me. Even though I worked at the Gap, I didn't get enough hours to get a discount. I was a part-time employee because I went to high school."" However, West recently suffered a $1 million (£785,000) loss after his limited-edition Yeezy GAP clothing line vanished from his Los Angeles warehouse.
Kanye West’s team is claiming over $1 million in clothing was stolen from his Los Angeles warehouse 🚨😳
📸 @TMZ pic.twitter.com/NykERX62hw — Salt Flash (@SaltFlash) March 16, 2024
As per The UK Mirror, a few days ago, the Hoodrat hitmaker's employees discovered that a significant quantity of Yeezy apparel had vanished from Ye's storage. The crew conducted some online research and came across a Kanye fan account promoting a clothing sale where buyers could get Yeezy GAP clothing, which is typically valued at over $100 (£78), for $20 (£15). Even though West's team appears to have found the stolen goods—roughly 60,000 pieces of apparel valued at an astounding $1.2 million (£943,000)—the American Boy rapper may not be able to get them back because the people behind the clothing sale assert that they were able to legally procure the Yeezy merchandise.
Milo Yiannopoulos, West's chief of staff exclusively told TMZ, that the fan account's clothes sales were unquestionably stolen. He asserted that the Yeezy crew had no documentation of the transaction, would never permit anyone to buy bulk merchandise, and promised that the team would go to all lengths to retrieve the missing items. Law enforcement officials on the other hand reported that not all of the apparel in question had receipts, but those in control of the event did.

According to Yiannopoulos, Yeezy accused the people organizing Friday's auction of fabricating documents to show the police that they had the products lawfully. The accusation was made in a cease and desist letter. Ye's right-hand man further asserted that his group had located one of the purported thieves and that he intended to provide any information to the police. West's team is committed to uncovering the circumstances surrounding this incident and has filed a police complaint since the theft occurred. It doesn't seem likely that the Runaway rapper will make any significant public remarks on the stolen goods.

Fans Accuse Kim Kardashian of 'Chasing' Kanye and Bianca as She Covers Her Face at Rapper's Concert,"Kim Kardashian was spotted supporting Kanye West during his concert in Los Angeles as their kid North West joined her father on stage. As reported by The Sun, Kardashian moved past the photographers, covering her face with her hand as if she didn't appreciate the attention. She was seen leaving the performance wearing a black hoodie over her arms, black trousers, and a tight white crop top.

Kardashian came under fire from several fans for attending the performance and reportedly 'chasing' after Kanye and his 29-year-old wife, Bianca Censori. As per the outlet, one fan commented in an online thread, ""She's clout chasing Ye and Bianca, but she's trying to disguise it like she's there to support North when she's not."" Another user said she was ""desperate for attention"" and that she watched the program to get material for her family's Hulu reality series. After Kanye's single, ""Vultures 1,"" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, a third person surmised that Kim's participation was a calculated power play. Recently, Censori and Kim made their first public appearance together when they were seen standing next to one other in a guarded section of the Chase Center in footage that was circulated on social media.

Kardashian was seen chit-chatting with Censori while she recorded her spouse singing live beside their kid, North. The Kardashian family member looked chic as always in an oversized black coat and shirt. In the meanwhile, Censori donned skintight leggings and a plunging pink shirt. She also slicked back her hair. Chicago and Psalm, the children of West and Kardashian, were present as well. Fans expressed their disbelief and emotions on Twitter, also called X, after seeing the unusual occurrence. One user commented, ""More shocked that Kim is there to begin with than I am that she's next to Bianca."" Another user wrote, ""Lmao! this was definitely not on my 2024 bingo card."" A third user wrote, ""Keeps her distance when he’s down and wants to steal the show when he’s up. Clout demon.""

Although this may be the first time Censori and Kardashian have met in public, the founder of SKIMS has said that she wants to continue having a calm divorce from her six-year marriage. As a source previously informed EOnline, Kim had no intention of severing her relationship with her ex, despite Kanye's controversial news. The source revealed, ""All the kids are very bonded to Kanye and adore him despite what's going on. Kim is doing a great job of not letting that change their relationship. Kanye will always be their dad and it won't change."" Censori and West got married in December 2022. In contrast, Kardashian has a history of high-profile relationships. She was previously in a relationship with Pete Davidson from November 2021 until August 2022. Since September 2023, she and Odell Beckham Jr. have had a romantic relationship.",2024-03-18T03:31:10Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Dr Max Pemberton: Why men like Kanye feel the need to control their wives,"The family and friends of Australian-born Bianca Censori, the wife of Kanye West, are said to be concerned for her wellbeing. From the photographs and stories I have seen online, I can’t say I blame them.
Censori, 29, an architect with a masters degree from Melbourne University, and West, 46, the rapper ex-husband of reality star Kim Kardashian, married in secret in December 2022 and have been causing controversy ever since.
Censori has been seen in increasingly risqué and compromising situations, from appearing to perform a sex act on her husband in Venice to wearing ever-more revealing clothes.
In addition, West has posted disturbing images of her on his Instagram page for his 20 million followers to view. They include shots of his wife in fetish gear, performing domestic chores, all uploaded to a chorus of criticism.
TheNightly Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. READ NOW
Censori has no social media accounts of her own — apparently banned by her husband, who says it is for her own protection.
There are further reports that West dictates what his wife wears, what she can eat and when she can speak.
Of course, what we see is just a snapshot of a marriage, and, for his part, West has said he just wants to show off his beautiful wife.
Yet former girlfriend, Julia Fox, 34, who dated West for a month in 2022, made some serious allegations in her memoir, Down The Drain, about someone she refers to only as ‘the artist’.
She revealed that ‘the artist’ attempted to control what she wore by sending her a wardrobe of clothes he had pre-approved. He also tried to persuade her to have breast implants.
When it comes to Censori, photographs of her before she met West show a happy, smiling young woman partying with her friends in Melbourne, wearing cocktail dresses, shorts and T-shirts.
By contrast, the photographs of her taken last month during Paris Fashion Week wearing a fur stole and sheer tights, with what seems to be no underwear beneath (a choice that could well see her face charges for indecent exposure) seem alarming.
Even though Censori insists she is comfortable in her own body, it’s clear to her family and friends that something has changed.
Over the years, I have had a number of patients who have been in coercive and controlling relationships — a form of psychological abuse whereby the perpetrator carries out a pattern of manipulative behaviours within a relationship.
What is shocking for those on the outside is how the victim is often unaware that it is even happening.
I’ve sat in front of people (mostly women, but men can be the victims of coercive control, too), and told them I’m worried they are being controlled, and they have shaken their head in utter denial.
One woman wasn’t allowed to see her family, have her own bank account and had to keep a tracker on her phone so her husband knew where she was at all times. She didn’t see this as disgraceful, chilling behaviour.
He had convinced her it was because he cared about her so much and wanted to know she was always safe.
The manipulator is often very clever in how they gain control — it happens gently at first and in small, subtle ways. They might suggest a partner isn’t very good with their finances, or is being ripped off in some way, and it would be better if they took sole control of the money.
Perhaps, after an argument with their family, the controller will encourage someone to cut off contact, saying their family don’t deserve them.
It’s usually couched in terms of wanting to help the other person be happier. Bit by bit, the victim’s sense of self is destroyed, their confidence eroded.
Sometimes it can happen so gradually that the person doesn’t realise — until, one day, they wake up and realise they hardly know themselves any more.
As they will often be deliberately distanced from friends and loved ones, opening their eyes to what’s really happening is all the more challenging.
But people can and do escape these kinds of toxic relationships, and the first step is always recognising the signs they might be being manipulated. Women’s Aid highlights ten key red flags to watch out for:
Isolating you from friends and family;
Depriving you of basic needs, such as food;
Monitoring your time;
Taking control over aspects of your everyday life, such as where you can go, who you can see, what you can wear and when you can sleep;
Monitoring you via online communication tools or spyware;
Depriving you of access to support services, such as medical services;
Repeatedly putting you down, saying you’re worthless;
Humiliating, degrading or dehumanising you;
Controlling your finances;
Making threats or intimidating you.
This is by no means an exhaustive list. But if any of these ring a bell for the relationship you’re in, then it might indicate coercive control, a recognised form of domestic abuse. It is a crime and the law is on your side.

Bianca Censori's Mother Joins Kanye West's Listening Party For the First Time Along With North West,"Amid the uproar surrounding her provocative attire, Bianca Censori, the wife of Kanye West, gained a new admirer when Alexandra Censori was seen accompanying her daughter, the Yeezy architectural designer, to the Vultures 2 album listening party. Exclusive photos that The US Sun was able to obtain showcased the mother and daughter duo inside a car as they arrived for the event. The former model sat in the middle seat behind her mother, who occupied the front seat. The pair looked shocked by the waiting paparazzi but displayed stony expressions on their faces.

During the Vultures 2 performance, the Donda rapper's eldest child, North West, 10, joined him on stage together with Ty Dolla $ign. Wearing an oversized black T-shirt and a fur hat, North stood out from the crowd in Inglewood, California. Alongside her cousins, Mason, 14, and Penelope, 11, whom Kourtney Kardashian has with her ex Scott Disick, the young rapper was also spotted engaging with admirers.

On Wednesday, the matriarch of the Censori family was spotted with her daughter and West. She was beaming as she got off a private jet in Los Angeles, California. Censori Sr. was dressed in a long-sleeved black dress and black heels. The young model attended the party as well, wearing a skimpy translucent bodysuit that showcased her figure. Ty Dolla $ign, was also present with the West-Censori family. After sponsoring another Vultures listening party in San Francisco, they made their way back to Los Angeles. Fans were primarily concerned about Bianca West's decision to wear provocative clothing in the presence of her mother.

""Unbelievable she's ok to dress like that in front of her mom,"" one fan wrote on a popular Reddit forum. ""You ever think she just wants to wear sweatpants or something? Like how is she comfortable?!"" a second fan noted. ""But I thought her family didn't approve of their relationship?"" a third fan asked. Bianca's mother reportedly became ""distressed"" last month after observing her daughter in yet another unduly skimpy costume. Her parents hardly recognized their daughter, according to insiders who spoke with The Daily Mail. ""Her family and friends are mortified because it just keeps getting worse and worse,"" the source said.

"Kanye West Addresses Boosie Badazz Diss, Takes ""No Responsibility"" For His Music","Kanye West is certainly no stranger to stirring up controversy, and his latest Big Boy TV interview was no exception. During the conversation, which also included Ty Dolla Sign, Ye claimed that he's behind the past two decades of music in one way or another. Of course, plenty of viewers disagreed with his take, and took to social media to chime in.
""I invented every style of music of the past 20 years, I created the genre. I created Weeknd's genre. Trav, Drake, everybody. I'mma go ahead and say with all love, Future and Thug also because the auto-tune album, 808s,"" he explained. ""Everybody thinks about Trav, Weeknd, and Drake but no one thinks about Future and Thug also. The auto-tune album. Now everyone, they added whatever it was to it. But here's a new genre.

"Why Kanye West Allegedly Makes Bianca Censori Wear Revealing Outfits And How Kim Kardashian May Be Involved, According To PR Expert","The relationship between Kanye West and Bianca Censori can be signified by several intriguing developments. That includes their secret wedding and an Italian vacation that was marked by a lewd act that reportedly got the couple banned from a water taxi . More recently, there have been a lot of eyes on Censori’s fashion choices, as many of her outfits have been notably revealing. This has led to speculation amongst the public about just how much control she has over her attire and general autonomy. Now, a PR expert is weighing in on why West allegedly has her dress in such a way, and they mentioned the rapper’s ex, Kim Kardashian, while making their case.
At this point, it’s honestly hard not to notice the Yeezy architectural designer’s bold looks, like one involving only body tape and another outfit that commentators said looked like a condom . This may all seem odd from the outside looking in, but Mark Borkowski believes there are specific reasons for all of this. Burkowski, who’s one of the UK’s most esteemed public relations veterans, claims Ye is having his wife dress in such a way to mirror a strategy supposedly used by Kim Kardashian. As the PR expert explains, the buzz that the “Jesus Walks” rapper is trying to create has the public divided as well:
Kanye understands outrage and is trying to break the Internet. I think a lot of people are starting to feel rather uncomfortable, despite everything he's said, about that he feels he can do whatever he wants with his partner. There is a line here drawn between those who believe this is control and those who believe that this woman is complicit and fully involved with this freak show. But it is a weird freak show that everybody is engaging with and some are enjoying these quite explicit photos. I think we'll be looking back at this if a rift appears between them as something that is something exploitative. Some of the dresses are built for craving for publicity.
So what the man seems to be saying here is that even if some of the publicity might be negative, it’s still publicity nonetheless and is earning attention for the Grammy winner and his brand. It’s fair to say that Kim Kardashian has indeed donned her share of distinct looks, yet one could argue that her outfits weren’t as revealing as those of the new Mrs. West. Also, ironically, as mentioned by DailyMail.com , Ye began to take issue with his partner “dressing too sexy” while they were together.
Over the past several months, Kanye West has continued to share pics of his scantily clad wife on social media. In January, he kicked off the new year by sharing (since-deleted) photos of Bianca Censori and declaring 2024 to be the year of “no pants.” Mark Borkowski shared more thoughts on West’s actions while speaking with DailyMail and, while he believes this buzz will keep the rapper in public conversations, he’s not sure if his image is salvageable due to other controversies:
You can only assume this is a way of Kanye keeping his name at the forefront and on everybody's lips and also a statement to his ex-wife Kim who engaged in the same publicity, which he is taking to another level but she did with a lot more style and panache. It wasn't as direct as this. … But I can't see a strategy here. He has pushed himself so far away from brands with his anti-Semitic remarks and outrage that there has to be a limit where he doesn't want one.
After making inappropriate remarks about people belonging to the Jewish faith, Ye was dropped by a number of companies, including Adidas, GAP, CAA and Balenciaga. He eventually opened up about the losses he’d experienced as a result of his statements. In his own words, he’d been “beat to a pulp.”",2024-03-17T15:28:28Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
"""20 Millionen Dollar"": Schuldet Kanye West Amber Rose Geld?","Kanye West (46) und Amber Rose (40) waren von 2008 bis 2010 ein Paar. Nach ihrer Trennung zofften sie sich zeitweise in der Öffentlichkeit. Nun spricht das Model in dem Podcast The Jason Lee Show über ihren Ex-Freund und meint, dass er ihr sogar Geld schulden würde. Der Song ""Monster"" von Kanyes Album ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" erlangte vor allem durch die Beteiligung von Nicki Minaj (41) große Bekanntheit. Doch laut Amber sei das ihre Idee gewesen. ""Ich sagte, dass 'Monster' ein großartiger Song sein könnte, an dem sie mitwirken könnte"", erklärt Amber und meint: ""Ich glaube nicht, dass ich dafür Anerkennung bekommen habe."" Die zweifache Mutter betont: ""Ich hätte 20 Millionen Dollar für 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' bekommen sollen. Aber ich habe nichts bekommen.""
Doch damit nicht genug: 2016 war in dem Video zu dem Song ""Famous"" eine nackte Wachsfigur von Amber zu sehen – allerdings ohne ihre Einwilligung. ""Niemand hat mich kontaktiert und gefragt: 'Ist das okay? Können wir dich für die Verwendung deines Bildes bezahlen?' Nichts dergleichen. Ich meine, das ist ziemlich abgefuckt"", schimpft die US-Amerikanerin. Und auch hier sah die 40-Jährige keinen Cent: ""Ich habe nichts bekommen. Ich habe kein Geld für irgendetwas bekommen. Ich hätte in irgendeiner Weise dafür entschädigt werden müssen, dass er mein Abbild und so viele Songs und die Wachsfigur verwendet hat.""
Dass Amber gar nicht gut auf den Skandalrapper zu sprechen ist, machte sie des Öfteren klar. ""Er mobbt mich mittlerweile seit zehn Jahren. Gerade erst nannte er mich eine Prostituierte. Da denke ich mir: Lass mich doch endlich in Ruhe"", gab sie in der YouTube-Show ""No Jumper"" preis. Laut der Tattoo-Liebhaberin sei Kanye ein Narzisst.

Bianca Censori Goes Braless For Shopping Trip Without Kanye West,"A lot of people think that Bianca Censori's provocative fashion choices are a result of her husband Ye, but it's clear that she doesn't need him to turn heads. Moreover, she recently went for some cosmetics shopping with her mother Alexandra in the San Fernando Valley. The former Yeezy architect donned a small pink minidress with no bra, paired with simple heels and slicked-back, tied-up hair. It's definitely a pretty small and innocuous fit choice compared to her usually revealing, scantily-clad, and more experimental style. But we can't say we're surprised at this being a pretty diverse spectrum of Bianca's own volition rather than the close-minded interpretation you'll often see in the media.
Furthermore, she's actually been spending a lot of time with her mother recently, such as hitting up Los Angeles to see Ye and Ty Dolla $ign's VULTURES ""performance."" In fact, Bianca Censori even ran into the Chicago artist's ex-wife Kim Kardashian at this event. They've been seeing a lot more of each other as of late, and it's great to see that they can keep up an amicable relationship. We don't know the details of their bond beyond what the cameras show, but considering that Censori's also spent time with their children, we can hope that things are pretty stable.

Meanwhile, she and Ye have never been shy about displaying some public affection at these events, such as dancing closely at a private L.A. listening party.

He's in a lot of public hot water, but it seems like this is one of the few bonds that he always champions and defends lovingly. Sometimes, the rapper's lyrical references to her don't match that energy, though, so we'll see if that changes in the near future.

Kai Cenat Shocked By Kanye West Manager Fight Threat,"Kai Cenat was taken aback when he learned that Kanye West's manager had threatened to fight him. John Monopoly had threatened to ""link up"" in Cenat's hood with a ""plus one"", casually saying that Cenat could ""bring his whole team"". In typically Kai Cenat fashion, the young streamer threw a tantrum, screaming and flopping back in his chair.
Cenat and West are beefing over Cenat's ""complaints"" about free Vultures merch he received. West felt Cenat should have been more grateful, instead of remarking that some of the clothing he had received was too big. However, he's not the only streamer that West has been beefing with as of late. West recently reflected on forcing Adin Ross to apologize to him over comments Ross made about West potentially needing a handout.

Elsewhere, Cenat and Druski are facing allegations of colorism after Druski said that a woman also appearing on Cenat's stream had ""manly"" features. While a number of online commenters were confused how the remarks were colorist when they didn't mention her skin, the answer is quite simple. Druski's comments fed into the longstanding sentiment that Black women are less visually feminine than their non-Black counterparts. Another term used to describe this attitude towards Black women is misogynoir. However, the backlash has been met with just as vocal support.
Neither Cenat nor Druski have addressed the controversy. Meanwhile, many people have leapt to the pair's defense. ""They literally said nothing about her skin tone. Y’all had adopted this “IG baddie” aesthetic that is also very similar to the T girls, & not all men like it. & I’m not debating with anybody. 😘,"" one person argued. Several other commenters would proceed to make incredibly transphobic comments to defend that Druski was simply expressing his ""preference"". These comments included stating Druski was ""making she was not a trans"" and other vile comments about the trans community. Where do you stand on the issue? Let us know in the comments.

Diddy Attends Kanye West's Rolling Loud L.A. Set With Ty Dolla Sign,"Ye and Ty Dolla $ign's Rolling Loud L.A. set this weekend probably wasn't what many fans expected for a couple of reasons. For one, it was more akin to their VULTURES listening parties than it was to a traditional festival performance, as they didn't really ""perform"" anything. Not only that, but another element that surprised a lot of folks is something they found out a couple of days after it went down, and relating to an even larger story in pop culture right now. From what TMZ footage indicates, it seems like Diddy went to this VULTURES event with his family and crew, as footage also emerged of his twin daughters attending Nicki Minaj's set.
Furthermore, this is interesting considering they are both in controversial, albeit very different, situations when it comes to their public image. Ye is still dealing with a lot of fallout from his antisemitism and the breakdown and volatility of his personal relationships, whereas Diddy faces multiple massive lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault and much more. As such, a lot of people think that they have more reason to link up now. After all, they've both spoken on the importance of solidarity and unity, although these circumstances make that sentiment hard to swallow.

For those unaware, their last public interaction concerned Ye's scandalous Drink Champs interview in which he expressed antisemitic and anti-BLM views. It notably got a lot of backlash for downplaying and spreading misinformation about the death of George Floyd, and folks called Diddy out for letting it air in the first place. While Revolt took it down eventually, this was a very odd situation given that the two had beefed over these controversial views before. With this in mind, many wondered why Sean Combs would let something like this happen in the first place.
Meanwhile, they're also both facing issues with their academic institutions, as well as a lot of legal trouble and general public scrutiny. We can only wonder where the two stand on each other right now, and whether they found reason to support each other. It will take a lot from both of them to one day find forgiveness from the media, society, and their fans. See the clips and footage of Diddy at Ye's show with the ""Via"" link below.

Bekommen Kanye West und Bianca Censori etwa bald Nachwuchs?,"Krönen sie ihr Liebesglück mit gemeinsamem Nachwuchs? Kanye West (46) und Bianca Censori (29) traten angeblich im Dezember 2022 vor den Traualtar. Seitdem macht das Paar mit seinen skurrilen Auftritten immer wieder von sich reden. Immer wieder vermuten Fans auch ein Liebes-Aus. Doch laut Justin LaBoy, einem langjährigen Freund des Rappers, könnte es zwischen dem Rapper und der gebürtigen Australierin nicht besser laufen.

Das Leben mit Kanye ist überhaupt nicht stabil"", verriet ein Insider im Gespräch mit Daily Mail.
Bianca selbst stellte ihre Mama-Qualitäten erst kürzlich unter Beweis: Vor wenigen Monaten kümmerte sich die gelernte Architektin rührend um die Kids ihres Liebsten: Nach einem Auftritt des ""Carnival""-Interpreten stellte sie sicher, dass die Kinder sicher in ein wartendes Auto einsteigen konnten.

On Wednesday, Kayne and his wife were seen exiting a private jet with rapper Ty Dollar $ign and mother Alexandra, with Censori sporting a leggy, black bodysuit and heels.
LaBoy, a source close to the controversial couple recently told TMZ he felt a family was on the cards.
“I think they are going to have a bunch of babies,” the rapper said.

Amigo da esposa de Kanye West revela a verdade sobre ela,"Kanye west, Bianca Censori / Reprodução TV / ExtraTV / YouTube
Bianca Censori, esposa de Kanye West, tem ganhado as manchetes com seus looks bizarros, e agora um amigo da arquiteta australiana defendeu seu estilo, e afirmou que ela sabe exatamente o que está fazendo.

Embora uma fonte anterior afirmasse que Ye é quem força a mulher a usar esses looks picantes, seu amigo sugeriu que Bianca tem seu próprio plano.
Em declarações ao jornal “Daily Mail”, a fonte afirmou que “ela sabe o que está fazendo” e assegurou que Censori, de 29 anos, não está sob o controle do rapper.
“Bianca conversou com sua família e disse aos amigos a mesma coisa desde a última vez que voltou para casa, ou seja, que sabe o que está fazendo e tem tudo sob controle”, explicou o informante.
“Ela investiu muito em seu casamento com Kanye e seu plano de jogo está começando a ficar aparente”, acrescentou a fonte.

Ela sempre foi picante, mas sabe que este é o seu minuto e que o seu minuto não durará para sempre”, justifica.
Sem Apoio
Segundo o jornal “Daily Mail” Bianca Censori tem planos de ter filhos com Kanye West, mas os pais da arquiteta australiana não apoiam de jeito nenhum essa ideia, devido à forma como pensam que o rapper trata sua filha.

Kanye West wollte Dreier mit Nicki Minaj und Amber Rose!,"Vor rund 14 Jahren hatte die Sängerin Nicki Minaj (41) den Song ""Monster"" veröffentlicht, in dem sie unter anderem über einen Dreier mit Kanye West (46) und Amber Rose (40) rappte. Wie nun herauskommt, versuchte Kanye die Zeilen des Liedes Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Laut Daily Mail, plauderte Kanye selbst im Interview mit Big Boy über den amüsanten Vorfall: Der Rapper hatte zusammen mit Künstler Safaree Samuels (42) an dem Album ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" gearbeitet – zu diesem Zeitpunkt war Kanye mit Amber Rose zusammen und Safaree war in einer Beziehung mit Nicki – wovon Kanye angeblich nichts wusste. ""Safaree, glaubst du, Nicki würde mich und Amber ranlassen? Wie sie es gesagt hat?""', stellte Kanye seinem Kollegen dann die pikante Frage.
Der Instagram-Account DJ Akademiks, der seine Follower mit Neuigkeiten aus der Hip-Hop-Szene auf dem Laufenden hält, teilte einen Ausschnitt des aufschlussreichen Interviews. ""Ye sagt, dass er versucht hat, einen Dreier mit Nicki und Amber Rose zu haben"", lautet die Bildunterschrift. Safaree bestätigte den witzigen Vorfall und kommentierte: ""Ja, das ist passiert"". Ergänzend dazu versah er seinen Kommentar mit einigen Lach-Emojis.
Kanye und Amber waren von 2008 bis 2010 ein Paar. Doch das Model ist mittlerweile gar nicht gut auf den Ex von Kim Kardashian (43) zu sprechen. ""Er mobbt mich mittlerweile seit zehn Jahren. Gerade erst nannte er mich eine Prostituierte. Da denke ich mir: Lass mich doch endlich in Ruhe"", erzählte sie in der YouTube-Show ""No Jumper"". Amber betonte, dass sie ja auch nicht schlecht über ihren Ex sprechen würde – einen kleinen Seitenhieb konnte sie sich allerdings nicht verkneifen und bezeichnete Kanye als ""Narzissten"".

Derfor går hun nesten naken,"Kona til Kanye West (46), australske Bianca Censori (29), har skapt overskrifter med sine dristige antrekk og vågale spaserturer i offentligheten. Fra gjennomsiktige ponchoer til å risikere fengselsstraff i Paris for sine antrekkvalg, har den 29 år gamle arkitekten ikke vært redd for å vise hud.
Men hva er årsaken til hennes kontroversielle stilvalg?
Eksperter spekulerer nå på om det hele er en del av et større spill mellom henne og Kanye West, hvor de prøver å overgå hans tidligere kone, Kim Kardashian (43), og ""få internett til å koke"" med deres nakenstunt.

Mark Borkowski, en anerkjent PR-guru, mener ifølge Daily Mail at Kanye vet hvordan man skaper opprør og oppmerksomhet, men at det ikke synes å være noen tydelig strategi bak parets oppførsel. Til tross for dette har deres oppsiktsvekkende offentlige opptredener, inkludert en romantisk stund båttaxi i Venezia der Kanye viste frem sin bare bak for forbipasserende turister, fått mye oppmerksomhet.

Cripto dispara 3.500% após brasileira seguida por Kanye West vender conta; entenda,"Rapper seguiu vários fãs em 2021 e depois fez ""limpeza"" no Instagram, mas perfil de brasileira ""sobreviveu"" porque esteve desativado temporariamente
Publicidade
Uma brasileira viveu seus momentos de fama nos últimos dias após viralizar na internet por ser uma das poucas pessoas seguidas pelo rapper americano Kanye West. Em questão de horas, a situação se transformou em uma memecoin que disparou de preço e movimentou milhões de dólares – e “morreu” pouco depois.
A situação começou quando a brasileira soube por acaso que era seguida por West no Instagram – a única conta acompanhada por ele na rede social além do também rapper Ty Dolla Sign. Segundo o site TechTudo, seu perfil foi um dos seguidos por West em 2021, durante campanha de lançamento de um novo álbum em que ele passou a seguir vários fãs. O cantor, no entanto, fez uma limpeza no perfil tempos depois, mas a brasileira “sobreviveu” porque sua conta estava temporariamente desativada – a surpresa veio nesta semana, quando ela reativou o perfil. A história foi compartilhada pela usuária na quinta-feira (14), no X (antigo Twitter).
Após a repercussão nas redes, ela anunciou aos seguidores: havia vendido a conta. “Não me interessa e não é de minha responsabilidade o que a pessoa vai fazer com a conta. Sou apenas uma pobre universitária devedora do Fies”, disse a internauta em uma de suas últimas publicações no X , segundo o TechTudo.

“Memecoin” dispara 3.500%
Após o anúncio de venda, o perfil foi remodelado e passou a promover uma nova criptomoeda chamada YE (em referência a Kanye West, que adotou esse nome), que logo ganhou notoriedade e passou a ser uma das mais negociadas do dia entre os ativos digitais que rodam na rede Solana (SOL), a mais popular do momento no mundo das criptos que têm origem em memes.
Por volta das 6h de sexta-feira (15), a criptomoeda era negociada por cerca de US$ 0,60. No pico, às 18h do mesmo dia, chegou a atingir US$ 21, uma disparada de 3.500%. Minutos depois, a cripto já havia perdido quase todo o seu valor. Segundo dados da plataforma Dexscreener, o token acumula queda de 91% nas últimas 24 horas.

Golpe
O caso traz características de um conhecido golpe no mundo das criptomoedas chamado de rugpull (puxão de tapete, em português). Ele envolve a promoção de uma criptomoeda controlada pelo criador, que usa as redes sociais para estimular que outras pessoas adquiram o ativo para inflar o preço.

Quando o valor alcança um determinado objetivo, ele despeja uma grande quantidade de tokens no mercado, usando compradores como liquidez para embolsar os lucros – e fazer a criptomoeda “evaporar”.
Em geral, o golpe é perpetrado por pessoas por trás de perfis anônimos nas redes, principalmente no Twitter e no Telegram. A brasileira que vendeu a conta nega ligação com o comprador. Seu ganho, aparentemente, teria sido apenas com a venda do perfil no Instagram, que já não é seguido mais por Kanye West. Enquanto isso, a conta da usuária no X, onde ela contou o caso, está fechada. O InfoMoney tentou contato, mas sem sucesso.

Schon wieder beim Ex: Kim Kardashian besucht Show von Kanye,"Kim Kardashian (43) ging zum zweiten Mal in dieser Woche auf ein Event von Kanye West (46). Fotos, die Just Jared vorliegen, zeigen, wie die vierfache Mutter sich für den Auftritt ihres Ex-Mannes in Los Angeles herausgeputzt hat. Auf den Bildern trägt sie eine schwarze Schlaghose aus Leder, passende Lederstiefel sowie ein bauchfreies weißes T-Shirt. Dazu kombiniert sie einen schwarzen Fellmantel und eine Tasche in Netzoptik. Der Anlass war eine Show des ""Flashing Lights""-Interpreten beim Musikfestival Rolling Loud. Der Hauptgrund für Kims Anwesenheit wird allerdings ihre Tochter North West (10) gewesen sein. Die stolze Mama konnte ihren Sprössling dabei beobachten, wie sie zu ihrem Song ""Talking / Once Again"" auf der Bühne tanzte.
Das Gesangstalent der Zehnjährigen konnten die Zuschauer leider nicht genießen. Bei den sogenannten ""Listening Partys"" spielen Kanye und Ty Dolla $ign ihr Album ab, ohne selbst dazu zu performen. Im Gespräch mit XXL Magazine verteidigte der ""Sucker For Pain""-Interpret diese Entscheidung: ""Es ist immer noch eine bessere Show als bei anderen Leuten, die ein Mikrofon haben."" Besucher des Festivals sind da teilweise anderer Meinung. ""Ich will nicht sagen, dass es scheiße war, aber ich hatte mir eine Show von Kanye einfach anders vorgestellt"", schreibt ein Fan auf X. ""Wir wollen unser Geld zurück!"", verlangt ein anderer Besucher vom Veranstalter.
Kim wird sich wahrscheinlich trotzdem gefreut haben, ihre Tochter auf der Bühne zu sehen. Schon am Dienstag hatte die Unternehmerin ein Event von ihrem Ex in San Francisco besucht. Dort hatte sie sich zum ersten Mal mit Kanyes neuer Partnerin Bianca Censori (29) gezeigt. Ein Livestream auf Instagram hatte gezeigt, wie die zwei Ladys nebeneinander zur Musik wippten. Das Verhältnis der beiden soll aufgrund der gewagten Outfits des Models schwierig sein. Eine Quelle verriet gegenüber Daily Mail: ""Kim hat Kanye angewiesen, dass Bianca sich niemals in der Nähe ihrer Kinder so kleiden darf.""

Qual o motivo do Kanye West ter sido vetado de se apresentar no Brasil?,"Meus amores, como sabemos os comportamentos e falas controversas do rapper norte-americano Kanye West nos últimos anos estão custando muito caro para suas apresentações fora dos EUA. De acordo com o jornal US Sun, depois de ter apresentações negadas na Europa, Austrália, Ásia e Oriente Médio, ele também foi barrado aqui no Brasil. Segundo fontes da reportagem do Veja, publicada nesta sexta-feira (15) não há “absolutamente nenhuma chance” do artista se apresentar por aqui e nenhum promotor de eventos quer arriscar sua credibilidade trabalhando com Kanye.
Os principais motivos para essa rejeição toda são os discursos recentes de Kanye com falas antissemitas e o fluxo constante de aparições controvérsias de sua esposa, Bianca Censori. O rapper esperava repetir o show icônico que os Rolling Stones fizeram em 2006 na praia de Copacabana, que contou com mais de 1 milhão de fãs, mas seu pedido teria recebido com uma recusa firme. Segundo uma fonte que trabalha para o governo do Rio teria dito ser “óbvio” que esses planos seriam recusados imediatamente. “A imagem de Kanye é muito controversa. Ninguém quer estar ligado a ele e às suas recentes controvérsias.”
E o jornal US Sun também garantiiu que tanto o Estádio do Maracanã, quanto o Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos, sede do Botafogo, também teriam sido procurados pelo artista, mas ambos os locais rejeitaram os pedidos. Kanye teria tentado contratos em São Paulo, Salvador e Belo Horizonte, mas teria sido rejeitado em todos os lugares.
“Nenhum governo local ou pessoas que administram os estádios e locais para shows ou eventos culturais querem que Kanye venha à sua cidade. É demais para lidar. A resposta sempre será não”, disse ao US Sun um consultor de negócios musicais para shows e turnês na América do Sul.",2024-03-16T12:00:00Z,https://jornaldebrasilia.com.br,Jornal de Brasília
"Kanye West and Bianca Censori Want to Have a ‘Bunch of Babies’, a Source Revealed","Critics have aimed at Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori after reports surfaced suggesting the controversial couple is looking to expand their family. Justin LaBoy, the rapper's close friend, confirmed that the pair, who got married in December 2022, are eager to start a family sooner, according to OK! Magazine. This revelation followed West's hint in his recently released track Timbo Freestyle that he might be considering having children with Censori. LaBoy said, “I think they are going to have a bunch of babies."" Additionally, West is already a father to North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm, whom he shares with his former wife, Kim Kardashian.

The disclosure has sparked widespread criticism online, with numerous fans asserting that the couple, who often grab attention due to Censori’s progressively daring fashion selections, are not suitable to raise a family, as per the Daily Mail. On a different note, when questioned about the speculation that West exerts control over Censori and has influenced her thinking, the friend remained tight-lipped. He said, “I don't, I can't speak on my brother's wife, I love him, I love her. She's great. She lives an amazing life. They're extremely happy. I've been around Ye for years now, he's the happiest he's been and she's extremely happy.""

While LaBoy is supportive of the artist's relationship, Censori's father reportedly takes issue with West. A source disclosed that Censori's dad wishes to speak with West regarding allegations that he has influenced his wife to wear inappropriate clothes. “Bianca’s father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the h--- he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” an insider said. The source added, ""He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.""
Meanwhile, amid the family planning talks, several users commented on a Social media post. One user wrote, ""They need help not babies. Neither of them seem to be in a healthy headspace."" Another user said, ""I hope they're going to have a bit more self-respect for the sake of their children."" Others also questioned whether Censori would adopt a more modest wardrobe once she becomes a mother. One user commented, ""So how are you going to explain to your child one day, why did mummy wear such few clothing?"" Another user commented, ""I feel sorry for the future children. Disfunction all around!!!""
Furthermore, Censori, who has embraced her role as stepmother to West's four children, appears to share the same desire to expand their family as her husband. This revelation follows a disclosure from a source close to Censori, indicating that she has discussed future family plans with her loved ones. Previously, Censori's parents had expressed their disapproval of her intentions to have a child with her controlling rapper spouse. An insider shared, ""He is her husband so of course she has talked about this and being a stepmom to Kanye's kids has really only made her desire to have kids stronger.""",2024-03-16T10:30:02Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Brazil Joins Growing List of Countries Banning Kanye West from Live Performances,"With his most recent smash album, Vultures 1, which has rocketed to the top of the charts since its release earlier this year, Kanye West is reveling in his newfound success. Promoters are obviously not delighted despite this being his first #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 since 2011. ""Nobody wants to be linked with him,"" stated a music industry consultant for South American tours and venues. The 40-minute anti-Semitic tirade by the Donda rapper has come back to haunt him because big nations won't allow him to perform in their venues.
Kanye goes on a rant, proudly comparing himself to Hitler as he mouths off against Jews, to cheers from the anonymous onlookers.

Promoters allegedly urged the controversial rapper to forget about touring in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Middle East since no one wants to jeopardize their reputation by providing him a platform, as The US Sun reported last week. According to a reliable source based in South America, there is ""absolutely no chance"" that he will perform in Brazil.
The 46-year-old infamous rapper has become practically untouchable after his latest crazy internet tirade about Jesus and Hitler, and promoters and organizers have distanced themselves even more from any discussions about potential shows due to a constant supply of suggestive photos of his wife Bianca Censori.

""Nobody wants to be linked with him and his recent controversies."" The Bound 2 rapper also apparently approached the famed Maracana Stadium and the Botafogo soccer team's home, the Nilton Santos Olympic Stadium, but both locations turned down the offers. Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and São Paulo all had similar stories.

West uploaded the since-deleted video in February in what looked to be his recording studio. As per The US Sun, he was seen complaining to his fans, ""We just sold out the United Center in seven minutes and I just wanted to reach out to see if there was anyone who could help with this,"" he said. ""It's the only arena that I had access to in the past year."" ""I call and people say there are no availabilities for me,"" he continued. ""You know why that is. If there's anybody out there who could help with this, please do,"" he concluded while asking for help in booking venues. West then uploaded a picture to Instagram.

Aussie architect and model Bianca Censori has been caught in her most recent questionable attire — another sheer G-string bodysuit exposing much of her figure.
Censori, 29, and West, 46, were spotted hopping off a private jet alongside Censori’s mother Alexandra and rapper Ty Dolla $ign on Wednesday, ahead of West’s Los Angeles Rolling Loud performance.
The Aussie star paired her revealing black bodysuit with tights that left little to the imagination and matching kitten heels, styling her short hair in a slick bun.

“You already know I’m impulsive/and another baby is my end goal”, raps West.

The musician’s close friend Justin LaBoy has confirmed the sentiment while talking to TMZ.
“I think they are going to have a bunch of babies,” said the fellow rapper.

LaBoy only had positive news to share surrounding the pair and said they are having an incredible time.
“She lives an amazing life. They’re extremely happy. I’ve been around Ye for years now, he’s the happiest he’s been and she’s extremely happy.”
Responding to claims West is controlling Censori, LaBoy did not confirm anything.
“I don’t, I can’t speak on my brother’s wife, I love him, I love her. She’s great.”
West currently has four children with ex-wife and world-famous reality star Kim Kardashian.
The controversial rapper has brought his children on stage with him during his recent performances.

Performance or Listening Party?,"Kanye West may have appeased his most diehard fans last night at Rolling Loud, but he likely didn’t win over the millions of skeptics who were open to giving the “Carnival” rapper another chance following his behavior over the last two years.
When the Vultures 1 star took the stage at Rolling Loud Thursday night (Mar. 14) at Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif., most weren’t expecting West to apologize for the hurtful, antisemitic comments he has made over the last few years.
However, he failed to do the one thing that more than 50,000 fans had come out expecting him to do: perform his music. Instead, he and Ty Dolla $ign, his collaborator on his new album, Vultures 1, took the stage without microphones and danced, vibed and waved their hands around while tracks from the album blared over the loudspeakers. In fact, neither artist rapped, sang or spoke during the performance, which took place during the annual hip-hop festival’s opening night.
Trending on Billboard
Despite the insistence from West and his followers that Thursday’s performance was high art, most fans left the hour-long performance looking disappointed and confused.
“Was I just tricked?” Gloria Appel, 22, from El Segundo, Calif., asked her group of friends as they walked back to their cars. One of her companions offered that, if anything, it was fun dressing up with friends and going out for the night — prompting the group to nervously laugh before scurrying away.
There’s a larger performance art aspect to the show, Ty Dolla $ign suggested in an interview he and West gave to radio personality Big Boi for XXL released this morning but recorded prior to Thursday’s show. “It’s still better than other people’s shows that have a mic,” said Ty during the chat.
What does it mean to “perform” a concert in 2024, when DJs play prerecorded mixes and vocalists sing over backing tracks? For the last two months, Ye and Ty have made millions from hosting “listening party” events around the world — effectively the same thing they did Thursday night — in the process generating some praise and lots of press for West as he once again attempts to revive his career. It also puts cash in Ty’s pocket, who, on the Vultures 1 track “Paid,” fittingly raps: “I’m just here to get paid.”
That same quote was retweeted Thursday night by The Rolling Loud team who spent weeks dodging specifics on the show. What was communicated to fans was that the concert was supposed to be different than the listening parties. During an X Spaces session with fans on Feb. 28, Rolling Loud co-founder Tariq Cherif told participants, “I’m fully prepared for Ye to perform and Ty Dollar $ign to perform. Whether or not they decide to grab the mic is up to them. That’s what they’re contracted to do.” Afterward, for clarity, a rep for the festival confirmed with Billboard that West and Ty Dollar $ign were “contracted to perform a live performance.”
Even if West and Ty Dollar $ign didn’t rap or sing, they clearly invested the kind of money associated with a major headline concert. There were dozens of stage managers and production and front-of-house staff furiously directing the set as the artists wandererd on and off the specially created in-the-round style stage, which was wedged between the bright red exterior lights of the KIA Forum and the subtler hues of the multibillion-dollar SoFi Stadium. During the set, West roamed the stage in a black jacket and a face mask as Vultures 1 tracks played over the festival’s huge sound system. After he and Ty Dollar $ign exited the stage for good, an offstage DJ continued on, playing about 30 minutes worth of classic Kanye tracks including “N* in Paris,” “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” and “All of the Lights.”
Most fans watched the performance without any visible reaction, though some modestly applauded at times. From the start of the show, it was unclear what was happening on stage, and by the time it ended, around 10 p.m., about half the fans in attendance had already trickled out. Those remaining behind took their time walking the exceedingly long, winding fence maze back to their cars, with many overheard saying that while the show was not what they had hoped for, it was what they expected. Kanye wasn’t speaking to them any longer, one fan noted, and he probably wasn’t listening to them, either.
Not exactly a ringing endorsement for West, who has hired back former manager John Monopoly and is planning a global tour for 2024, according to a recent Billboard report.
Following the confusion on Thursday night, one thing is clear: If West isn’t going to perform live at his future shows, he should be more transparent about it. While he certainly entertained at least some of his fans, he did so with a bare minimum of effort and, ahead of the show, didn’t make any attempt to repudiate rumors that he was planning to sing and rap.
As West told Big Boi during their interview, he believes most fans are coming to his events “just for the experience.” He further noted that he wants to create more call-and-response style chants with the audience at his performances, but didn’t explain how he could do that without speaking on stage. He said a highlight of past listening parties was hearing attendees mimic the wailing chorus of “Carnival,” noting that fans have come up with their own chant: shouting “F— Adidas!” after the shoemaker cut ties with him in 2022.
As for which artist would open future concerts, West had a unique suggestion.
“The smoke is like an opener with the lights themself,” he told Big Boi as Ty Dolla $ign shook his head in approval. West probably meant to say “fog,” the industry term for the smoky effect created by atomizing glycerin-based fluids with mineral oil. West is certainly right about the substance’s appeal to fans. As many in the business say, the fog effect has almost no downside — it’s just here to get sprayed.",2024-03-15T23:12:14Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Kanye West's Allegedly Stolen YZY GAP Merch Sold At LA Pop-Up, Dov Charney Puts Them On Blast","It's no secret that Kanye West is making a ton of cash off of Yeezy, and allegedly, an LA pop-up recently tried to get in on some of his success. Today, a clip of Dov Charney accusing said pop-up of stealing Ye's YZY GAP clothes and selling them for profit started to make its rounds online. In the clip, the American Apparel founder is frantic, shouting about the allegedly stolen goods until police intervene.
""This merchandise has been stolen!"" he yells, ""From Ye, formerly known as Kanye West!"" Eventually, a law enforcement officer ushered him away from the storefront, and they exchanged a few words that can't be made out in the clip. ""On what grounds?"" Charney then asks loudly, ""This was stolen! Ongoing investigation?"" He appeared to rally some support from onlookers.

American Apparel Founder Goes Off Over Kanye West's Allegedly Stolen Goods
The YZY Gap pop-up was promoted by Urban Necessities and SRGN Studios on social media earlier this week. They also boasted that every item would be on sale for $20 and be available on a first-come, first-serve basis. Originally, the pop-up promised that over 60,000 items would be available for purchase. Shortly after it opened, however, it was shut down by the Los Angeles Police Department. Authorities confirmed that they had received a call about possible theft in a recent conversation with Complex, also stating that there is an ongoing investigation into the pop-up.
Ye seemingly supported the theft allegations by reposting the above clip of Charney on his Instagram Story today. It remains unclear how organizers of the pop-up were able to get their hands on the merch. What do you think of an LA pop-up being accused of selling stolen YZY GAP merch? What about Dov Charney calling out the pop-up publicly for the alleged theft? Share your thoughts in the comments section down below, and keep an eye on HNHH for more updates.

Ye Says He Invented ‘Every Style of Music of the Past 20 Years’,"Ye and Ty Dolla $ign sat down with Big Boy to talk all things Vultures for an exclusive interview. They touched on a variety of topics, ranging from the duos chemistry, Ye trying to convince Ty Dolla to make a “clean” album with no profanity, how their No. 1 song “Carnival” came about, and family. But the clip that stood out was the one in which Ye claimed he “invented every style of music of the past 20 years,” essentially saying he birthed the careers of The Weeknd, Drake, Future, and Young Thug.

“I done invented every style of music of the past 20 years, I created this genre. I created Weeknd’s genre, Trav, Drake…I’m gonna go ‘head and say it, with all love, Future and Thug also, because of the autotune album if you think about it,” Ye said to Big Boy.”

Now, that is certainly an interesting take. Some may agree while others would be right to bring up T-Pain when it comes the question of who popularized autotune. We all know those two have a rocky history, so maybe it’s not all that surprising Ye would conveniently forget to mention the influential Florida artist.
It’s also interesting that Ye did not give Kid Cudi the credit many believe he deserves for ushering in a new style of melodic hip-hop. After all, it’s well known that Cudi heavily influenced Ye’s 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak. That’s the “autotune album” he’s referring to in the interview. It’s also the album many believe paved the way for an artist like Drake to flourish.
Elsewhere in the interview, Ye explained that the reason he decided to go on this album run with Ty is due to the fact that Ty stood by him when “a million people told him to not stand beside me.” He also compared the singer/songwriter to another longtime collaborator, producer Mike Dean, saying, “you can give him something, even just like a murmur or something, and he could bring it back with the words; he can fix all the notes on it; he can bring the drums, the music.”
Also interesting is the origin of the Vultures duo. Ty said the idea for the group and the album originated when the two met up in a studio while in Japan. He asked Ye if he would executive produce his next album and Ye agreed. The first song they made after that was the Band of Thieves-sampling “Burn” which lead them to say “f**k it, let’s just do a whole [album]!”
Released on February 10 after months of false starts and delays, Vultures 1 debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 200 albums chart. The album’s third single, “Carnival,” featuring Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti recently hit number one on the Hot 100 chart, marking Ye’s fifth chart topper and Ty’s second.

North teases collab with dad Kanye West on upcoming debut album,"file footage
North West played coy when asked about a potential team up with father Kanye West in her debut album.
In a recent interview with 13-year-old Brooklyn reporter Jazzy at Rolling Loud festival, the 10-year-old daughter of Kanye and Kim Kardashian offered an insight into her upcoming album titled, Elementary School Dropout.
“It’s gonna [sic] be great,” she enthused when asked about the expectations from the album.
The granddaughter of Kris Jenner refused to give away the album release date and said upon asking about a potential collaboration with Kanye West: “Maybe. We don’t know yet!”
North first announced her prospective music project during an appearance on stage alongside her rapper dad at his Vultures 2 listening party in Phoenix, Arizona last week.
The album title is understood to be a tribute to the Donda rapper’s debut album, which was titled The College Dropout, released in 2004.
Besides accompanying her father at several album launch events across his career, North was also featured on a track from Kanye’s new album, in which she showcased her rapping skills.
She sang in the song titled, Talking / Once Again: ""It's your bestie. Miss, Miss Westy! Don't try and test me. It's gonna get messy. Just, just bless me. Bless me!""",2024-03-15T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Kim Kardashian Supports Kanye West With Rolling Loud Appearance,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were a power couple for many years. However, their marriage eventually fizzled out all the way back in 2021. At the time, Kanye was saying some damning things in the media, and it became too much for Kim. Overall, fans thought they would be together forever. That said, it was just not meant to be. These days, Ye is married to Bianca Censori, while Kim is currently dating Odell Beckham Jr. They both seem to be quite happy, albeit supportive of one another.
For instance, Kim was recently at a Vultures listening party. During this appearance, Kim was standing right next to Censori. No one could get a read on how they feel about one another, however, they stuck around each other nonetheless. A few days later, Kim and Bianca found themselves in the same vicinity, this time at Rolling Loud California. Although there is no footage of the two together, there is a chance they crossed paths. Either way, Kim seemed to be enjoying her time amongst the crowd.

Unfortunately for Kanye and Ty Dolla Sign, the reviews of their latest show have not been positive. Instead of actually performing, they just vibed to their own music on stage. Overall, fans expect a better product and the reactions on social media dictate as such. Regardless, Ye and Ty are massive artists, so this won't hurt them that much. Although it may force them to adjust how they go about their performances, moving forward. Hopefully, this isn't going to become the norm not just for them, but other artists as well.

"Kanye West And Ty Dolla $ign's ""Vultures"" Experience At Rolling Loud Was All About Missed Potential","Kanye West is an artist who's always been able to see the value of a great performance. His career is full of legendary on-stage moments from his rendition of ""Hey Mama"" honoring his late mother at the 50th Grammys, to him and Jay-Z unpacking a Watch The Throne classic 12 times in a row in Paris, to his brief rekindling with Drake for a special Larry Hoover Benefit show. In the past 10 years of his career, however, he's become a fan of the listening party.
But despite assumptions the iconic moments haven't slowed down a bit since. The unveiling of his Yeezy Season 3 collection alongside the debuting of material from The Life Of Pablo is one of the most recognizable moments of his career. A few years later he captivated fans all over again with a trio of DONDA listening experiences preceding the album's release. Fans watched early material transform over time and shared in the surprise as artists like DaBaby and Marilyn Manson appeared. All of that is to say that a special VULTURES listening party at Rolling Loud Los Angeles was rife with potential to be his next legendary moment. Despite all of that potential, West delivered a night that won't exactly enter the textbooks of rap history.
Kanye West's Underwhelming Evening

To start, many of the fans in attendance were fully expecting a performance instead of just a listening party. Rolling Loud itself didn't exactly build up expectations for a live performance, but they were also careful about their wording. ""Vultures headlining,"" and ""Vultures live"" were used to describe the set. For fans paying attention to West's recent run of shows it was easy to connect the dots, but it's clear that many others came in expecting a more conventional concert.
Those disappointed fans got the chance to express themselves in the comments of a Rolling Loud post about the show. Underneath pictures of the duo on-stage attendees shared their thoughts. ""I’m grateful to see Kanye Live but this was probably his worst performance ever"" one of the top comments on the post reads. ""This should’ve just been a Fortnite concert"" another agrees.
Fans React To Kanye West's Rolling Loud Set
The bulk of Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's ""VULTURES"" show was similar to many of the other recent listening parties. It got underway around 40 minutes after the scheduled start time, which felt early by West's standards. The pair made the long walk onto a stage in the center of the crowd sporting ski masks and black jackets. The stage itself sat underneath a dome-like pair of crisscrossing beams. They served as overhead lighting throughout the performance while massive smoke machines covered all the artists on stage in a thick mist.
As you'd expect, the listening party was a star-studded affair. Among the least surprising guests was North West, who brought a group of friends along sporting matching Vultures shirts to dance to her now beloved guest verse on ""TALKING."" Despite being an expected addition the adorable moment was undeniably one of the highlights of the night. YG was also there which was unsurprising as he's performing at the festival alongside Tyga at the festival on Friday.

Throughout the night numerous guests joined. Freddie Gibbs marked the first surprise appearance of the night and fans erupted when he came on stage to mime his standout verse on ""BACK TO ME."" Additionally Quavo, Rich The Kid, and Bump J were all in attendance for their appearances on various VULTURES cuts. Though the crowd was excited as guests emerged on stage, the allure of seeing a surprise collaborative performance didn't quite transition into a listening party.
As the set went on, more and more attendees appeared to realize that they weren't there for a performance. Compared to viral videos showing seas of hyped crowds at Rolling Loud the demeanor of the audience felt stuck in a permanent state of anticipation. Throughout the night the DJ pulled a classic live performance move and cut out memorable refrains from various songs to let the audience's singing take over. But it was impossible not to notice throughout the night that the enthusiasm was fading.
A Series Of Unfortunate Teases

West and Ty left the stage after around 40 minutes with their performance failing to reach the 9:30 time promised despite getting off to a late start. Around 30 minutes into their set, in full view of the crowd, the pair both dramatically removed their masks and headgear on stage. It would have been the absolute perfect time for them to pick up a microphone and surprise the crowd with an actual performance. But it never came to be and the pair departed the stage after playing shortened versions of every song from VULTURES 1 and the previously debuted Backstreet Boys-sampling ""EVERYBODY.""
What followed was unfortunately the crystalizing moment of the entire evening. Following a 5 minute interlude where fans waited in bulk for some kind of encore, the crowd erupted in cheers as ""Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1"" came on over the speakers. The expectation of the audience was clear, West would come back out and finish his set with a few classics, but that never happened. As one hit after another came on over the speakers, ""Flashing Lights,"" ""Runaway,"" ""Fade,"" and more, fans slowly realized that the show was over.
One of the most fascinating features of Rolling Loud's main stage is that planes fly shockingly low overhead as they land at LAX. It happened throughout the night and fans repeatedly pointed their cameras at the passing aircraft in bulk as they soared by. Around 10 songs deep into the DJs set following West's exit the Watch The Throne classic ""Otis"" came on the speakers. Just as the song shifted into the intense final verse yet another plane passed overhead, shortly followed by West's lyric ""Can't you see the private jets flying over you."" Had he been performing the track live, the moment could have been yet another instantly timeless entry into Kanye West's career. Instead fans were left with the perfect lasting image of the VULTURES Rolling Loud set. Watching an accidentally brilliant moment fall short of its potential as more and more of the fans in attendance began shuffling away from the empty stage towards the exit.",2024-03-15T18:10:47Z,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com,HotNewHipHop
Fans Expected Kanye West To Perform At Rolling Loud. They Did Not Hold Back When He Ended Up Only Dancing Instead,"Kanye West was seemingly having a week free of controversy after cameras spotted his ex, Kim Kardashian, hanging with his wife, Bianca Censori, and his daughter North West announced her first album. However, unfortunately, he ruffled some feathers with fans after his big performance at California's Rolling Loud festival ended up not being much of a performance at all. Yeezy spent most of his set dancing, and those who attended didn't hold back with how they felt about that.
Ye was the headliner for Night 1 of Rolling Loud, and thousands showed up to see the rapper perform songs from his Vultures 1 album alongside collaborator and singer Ty Dolla $ign. Many were led to believe this would be a traditional concert performance, but once the show started, it became clear that this was a performance more in line with the listening parties he hosted in the past. Posts began to roll in from social media complaining about the performance, and there was even a video of Ye dancing on stage without a microphone in hand:
I’m not gonna say the show sucked but I just thought going to a Kanye show would be different #rollingloud pic.twitter.com/pbFYiccZ16March 15, 2024 See more
Audiences watched as Kanye West and other musicians danced on stage to the songs, but once the music from Vultures 1 ended, West promptly left the stage. The final stretch of the concert featured a DJ playing some of the rapper's most classic songs while smoke poured over the stage, potentially to hide the fact he wasn't there. If that was the intention, it doesn't seem like attendees were fooled:

This wouldn't be the first time Kanye West has disappointed his listeners. He charged attendees a lot of money at a previous performance only to drastically drop the price closer to showtime. The concert was so lackluster that some in attendance had the suspicion it wasn't actually the rapper on stage the entire time.

Some were shocked by the performance, but others weren't as surprised. The rapper has been known for these types of things before, and some believe it was his plan all along to do a listening party rather than a performance:

Not everyone who attended had a bad time though. While there were plenty of tweets critical of what they saw during the Rolling Loud performance, there were also attendees who loved hearing Vultures 1 and seeing all the talent that took the stage. While it may not have been a traditional performance, it still seemed like a party with a concert atmosphere and fans jammed to the music:

No word from Ye as of yet on how he felt about his performance at Rolling Loud, but it could be coming. The musician has taken to social media to talk about everything from his terminated Adidas contract to making apologies in Hebrew on Christmas Day, so it's possible that he'll comment on this situation. Whether fans are off or on board with Ye, there's no denying he knows how to generate headlines with his antics.
Those who miss the old Kanye, as his song goes, can use their Netflix subscription to watch his documentary series Jeen-Yus: A Kanye Trilogy. It's a great look at the musician's early career and the storied life he's led that transformed into where he is in right now.",2024-03-15T14:55:41Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Rapper Kanye West é vetado de tocar no Brasil; entenda o caso,"Os comportamentos e falas controversas de Kanye West nos últimos anos estão custando agora suas apresentações fora dos Estados Unidos. Segundo o US Sun, depois de o rapper ter tido show negado na Europa, Austrália, Ásia e Oriente Médio, agora ele também foi vetado no Brasil. De acordo com o site, promotores de eventos alegam que ninguém quer arriscar sua credibilidade.
Ainda de acordo com o site, um produtor que trabalha na América do Sul afirmou que não há “absolutamente nenhuma chance” de ele se apresentar no Brasil.
O recente discurso de Kanye nas redes sociais com falas antissemitas e um fluxo constante de fotos picantes de sua esposa, Bianca Censori, vem acendendo alertas de negócios no país e fazendo com que promotores e organizadores evitem qualquer conversa sobre possíveis shows.
Intenções de Kanye - O rapper, que agora atende como Ye, esperava replicar o que os Rolling Stones que fizeram em 2006 com um icônico show na praia carioca de Copacabana, onde mais de 1 milhão de fãs compareceram para prestar homenagem.
No entanto, segundo o US Sun, o cantor recebeu um firme não por causa da sua imagem e por questões de segurança. Uma fonte que trabalha para o governo do Rio disse que era “óbvio” que esses planos seriam rejeitados imediatamente.
“A imagem de Kanye é muito problemática”, disse a fonte. ""Ninguém quer estar ligado a ele e às suas recentes controvérsias.""
O Estádio do Maracanã e o Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos, sede do time de futebol Botafogo, também teriam sido abordados, mas ambos os locais rejeitaram os pedidos.
Ele também supostamente teria tentado a sorte em São Paulo, Salvador e Belo Horizonte, mas teria sido rejeitado em todos os lugares
Seu primeiro lugar no topo da Billboard Hot 100 desde 2011 não seria suficiente para mudar as percepções atuais.“Ninguém quer estar ligado a ele”, disse um consultor de negócios musicais para shows e turnês na América do Sul.“Nenhum governo local ou pessoas que administram os estádios e locais para shows ou eventos culturais querem que Kanye venha à sua cidade. É demais para lidar. A resposta sempre será não"".",2024-03-15T12:40:57Z,https://www.tnh1.com.br,TNH1
"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign Accused Of ""Scamming"" Rolling Loud With Lackadaisical Performance","Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign are still in the midst of their Vultures rollout. Overall, they have seen quite a bit of success with Vultures 1. Now, however, fans are waiting on them to come through with Vultures 2. The album is not out yet, and fans are starting to get antsy. However, the pair has come through with some listening parties, which have effectively given fans something to be hopeful for. On Thursday, however, they had a huge opportunity at their fingertips as they performed at Rolling Loud.
This Rolling Loud performance was a special one as they were the only set of the day. If you had bought a three-day pass to the festival, you were granted access to this special set. Unfortunately, it seems as though some festivalgoers wish they had just stayed home entirely. In footage posted to Twitter, Kanye and Ty could be seen walking around the stage, barely engaging with the music. In fact, some reported that their mics weren't even on, which made this more of a listening party.

In the tweets below, you ca see just disappointed people were with the entire ordeal. Overall, it just wasn't the best look for Ye and Ty. Especially when you consider how Vultures 2 is a week past due at this point. Fans want the album, and they were hoping that tonight could serve as some sort of launch point. Instead, it was a disappointing performance that showcases just how out of touch Ye is these days.

Kanye West Just Stands During Headlining Rolling Loud 'Performance',"For their headlining set opening the Rolling Loud California festival in Los Angeles on Thursday night, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign merely stood onstage for an hour while pre-recorded music from their already released first album played over the loudspeakers.
While the wording in the official announcement of the late-added performance was unspecific — “Vultures headlining new Thursday night,” the since-deleted post read — it’s safe to say that most people expected the duo, who have been working together under the name Vultures, to at least deliver vocals. But instead, the pair — clad in dark hooded outfits, with West wearing his now-familiar hockey mask — merely roamed the circular stage at SoFi Stadium for an hour while their “Vultures 1” album played. After the duo had left the stage, a DJ played hits from earlier in West’s career as the stage filled with dry ice.
The pair defended their appearance in an interview on Big Boy TV in the early hours of Friday, with West claiming, “People just came for the experience.”

pic.twitter.com/hi2N3dNMoc — XXL Magazine (@XXL) March 15, 2024
Sources tell Variety that the festival had expected a more conventional performance as well, and even erected a special stage with a circular lighting rig for the set, which was announced on Feb. 15 and added as a stand-alone Thursday night show for the three-day weekend festival, months after the full lineup was unveiled. Many people criticized the festival for hosting West, due to his antisemitic remarks over the past months, which have left him without a label or publishing deal and cost him all of his high-profile endorsement deals.
There was no immediate confirmation of reports that the pair were to be paid $10 million for the appearance.
While the format was similar to his public album-listening sessions that he’s staged for nearly every release since the run-up to the “Life of Pablo” album in 2016, they’ve always been advertised as such — and have never before featured only previously released music, or taken place at a festival. It was unclear whether the move was a statement about the album — which West has gloated about reaching No. 1 on the Billboard 200, despite his detractors — or some sort of dig at Rolling Loud, a festival he has performed at twice before.
Given West’s often-contrarian nature, it would not be surprising to see him take the stage with another artist later during the festival, which kicks off in earnest tonight and runs through Sunday with acts including Nicki Minaj, Post Malone and the duo of Future and Metro Boomin.
Not surprisingly, many fans were enraged while others defended West, although rarely specifically about Thursday night’s format. Thursday-only tickets were sold for the event, although fans who had already purchased tickets for the festival’s main three nights did not pay extra for admission. Attendees say venue entrances were very congested before the show, causing many fans to arrive late.

The YesJulz and Kanye West drama explained,"It's all getting messy behind the scenes at Yeezy, with famed influencer YesJulz getting fired from Kanye West's brand by the chief of staff, Milo Yiannopoulos.
This has led to chaotic fallout including leaked text messages, emails and formal statements from everyone involved.
Here's everything we know:
Who is YesJulz?
Julieanna Goddard, 34, is an influencer, talent manager and entrepreneur, who posts as 'YesJulz' online.
Her role was seemingly to connect with West's fanbase, including livestreaming his Las Vegas listening party.
What has she allegedly done?
YesJulz allegedly violated her NDA by communicating with West's fan base online.
Reportedly, YesJulz suggested fans create an app dedicated to the Yeezy fanbase. She allegedly went on to detail a virtual currency they would be credited with that could be used to purchase things on the app. However, none of this was pre-approved by the rapper himself.
""We could all close our eyes and imagine what a Yeezy universe would look like if we were in a video game. We know that we’d be willing to pay to pull up to the shows and watch those livestreams. We’d even be willing to pay to have a meeting like this where we can ideate together, not only with Ye but some of his most trusted collaborations,” she reportedly said during a stream.
She continued: ""He knows how active you’ve been. I know sometimes it might feel like you might be working all day, every day, and your work is not being seen or recognized,""
""But let this week be a testament that every single thing that you guys do is appreciated, and it’s 1,000 per cent seen by myself, the team, and most importantly, Ye.""
What has Kanye West said?
West took to his Instagram Story on 12 March, stating that his company has parted ways with the creator.
""We have decided to no longer have YesJulz involved in the roll out of Vultures [1]. All the activity on her page and with our fans in the past few days has been unauthorized,"" he wrote in a statement.
What has happened since?
YesJulz was ""fired"" and received a letter from Milo Yiannopoulos, Yeezy's chief of staff, fining her a staggering $7.7 million.
""Enclosed please find a letter and statement of account from your time with Yeezy. Fines incurred to date as a result of your NDA violations come to $7.7m,"" the letter, which has been shared online read.
""While you were a contractor, I suspended enforcement of this debt. It now falls due. Hassan from the compliance team will reach out with information about payment.
""Please note that any further violations will accrue more fines. Because you are being terminated for cause, but also because you forgot to sign your contract, your termination is effective immediately.""
A separate email from Yeezy and signed off from Yiannopoulos read: ""Obviously, you are fired.""
What has YesJulz said?
YesJulz has taken to X/Twitter to expose Yiannopoulos, who ""controls who gets hired + fired & when they get paid.""
Despite not addressing the firing or aspects of the NDA she supposedly violated, she did leak some text messages from him.
One message from Yiannopoulos allegedly read: ""Surely the last thing we need is bright ideas from Down Syndrome [Kanye West] megafans on social media.""
He seemingly continued: ""Half of these obsessive megafans online have developmental disorders. I'm very much not a fan anyway of the fake sounding 'tell us what you think!' outreach. Feels atrociously off brand for Ye and needs a rethink.""
Here's what people online have said about the fallout:

"Kanye West Is Letting Drama Over Shadow the Success of ""Carnival""","“Carnival” is Ye’s (the artist formerly known as Kanye West) first No. 1 single since being featured on Katy Perry’s “E.T.” (his first as a lead artist since 2007) and it seems like he’s back on top. Musically, at least.
“Rich, Ty, Carti and the supporters that stood by us through everything, this No. 1 is for you. It’s for the people who won’t be manipulated by the system and f*ck adidas and everybody who works there or with them. Anyone who goes to school with anyone whose parents work at adidas, just know they tried to destroy me and here we are with the No. 1 song in the world,” he posted in a since-deleted statement on his Instagram account this week.
If you thought Ye wasn’t going to be cocky after earning his first No. 1 in 13 years, you thought wrong. He clearly feels that him sitting atop the Billboard Hot 100 is a huge deal. And to be fair, it is. At 46 years old he’s the oldest rapper to achieve this feat — and doing so after some of the most tumultuous years of his career makes this achievement even more unbelievable.
Trending on Billboard
But the question on everyone’s mind right now is: how long will this last?
Kanye West disses Drake, Adidas, Hailey Bieber, Daily Mail and others in an Instagram post promoting his new music video for “Carnival.”
“And it’s f**k Drake for taking Durk right at the beginning of the Vultures role out.” pic.twitter.com/FKjViPbvO5 — XXL Magazine (@XXL) March 12, 2024
We’ve seen this movie before. Granted, this time it’s been both amplified and accelerated, but the general idea remains the same. Ye does something to infuriate a large group of people which puts his career in peril. When the peril seems all too real, he shows contrition either through an apology or through a piece of art that tries to explain why he did the thing that infuriated all those people in the first place. And eventually, after some passage of time, he winds up back in everyone’s good graces. Most people think of him on stage at the VMAs and the subsequent release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy as the precedent of this cycle.
That was all a long time ago, though. His legacy has taken a major hit over the years as his erratic and, at times, offensive behavior has overshadowed his art. Back in 2016, things got shaky for Ye when some of his Saint Pablo Tour performances were derailed by rantings and ravings. This was blamed on exhaustion and dehydration and led to him being hospitalized and forced to cancel the remaining legs of the tour. That same year he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and pledged his allegiance to Former President Donald Trump. Ye then became a born-again Christian and started to share some of his religious beliefs, like his pro life view on abortion.
Then came his very public divorce from Kim Kardashian and his run of antisemitic remarks that resulted in adidas dissolving their groundbreaking partnership and other companies like JP Morgan Chase severing ties with the artist. Amid all of this, the music he was releasing wasn’t getting the critical acclaim his earlier work received. Ye, Jesus Is King, Donda 1 & 2, and Kids See Ghosts all got mixed reviews. The combination of his controversial opinions and the stream of mid music resulted in fans starting to completely tune him out. History has proven that hit records can fix a lot. But smashes can only do so much—they ain’t magic wands.
It’s clear Ye has amassed a new legion of fans who are more tolerant of his antics off the field; ones who are able to excuse his bigotry and abrasiveness. But his older fans (I’m one of them) have been mostly turned off by his shenanigans in recent years and it’s going to take a lot more than a hot song to win us back. When I first ran through Vultures 1, “Carnival” didn’t immediately jump out to me as a song that had the potential of becoming a hit record. I thought “Paid” and “Vultures” were the “ones” off this album, and even then I didn’t believe either of them would hit the top of the charts. However, in hindsight, I underestimated “Carnival’s” anthem potential and the power of a #veryrare Playboi Carti feature.
Now, that said, even with “Carnival” going number one, I have to say that on a scale of 1 to 10, I’m at around a five when it comes to Ye continuing this run of success. I’m just not sure he’s into traditional success anymore. He seems to love the drama more than the music these days.
Just look at what’s happening with this Julieanna Goddard debacle. Instead of people talking about his first No. 1 in over a decade, people are talking about a controversy involving members of his Yeezy team. On Tuesday, Ye publicly distanced himself from the Miami-based marketer better known as YesJulz, posting an Instagram Story that read, “We have decided to no longer have YesJulz involved in the role out of Vultures. All the activity on her page and with our fans in the past few days has been unauthorized.” Then an email floated around—allegedly from Chief of Staff Milo Yiannopoulos, yes the far right commentator who managed Ye’s presidential campaign—saying she had been fired and will be fined $7.7 million for violating her NDA, even though she didn’t sign her contract. I’m no legal expert, but I don’t think you can violate a contract you never signed. YesJulz then went on the offensive and shared several screenshots and emails from Yiannopoulos which contained disparaging remarks about Ye’s fanbase. And, frankly, It’s all a sh*tshow.
Heres what Milo, the Chief of Staff
who controls who gets hired + fired
& when they get paid,
thinks about the very fan base that fought so hard to get Ye his first #1 in over a decade pic.twitter.com/N0FEZTny1k — Yesjulz (@YesJulz) March 14, 2024
We should be talking about Ye’s return to form, instead we’re trying to piece together why Milo Yiannopoulos is back on his team and if the original email is even legit or not. Ye eventually deleted his posts about YesJulz, but the damage has already been done. No one knows what’s really going on over there, but one thing is for sure: Ye is addicted to drama. How long before he makes more disparaging remarks about people he perceives to be against him? If his celebratory Instagram caption is any indication, it won’t be long at all. If he’s not able to get his house in order and focus on the art, his first No. 1 in nearly a decade and a half will mean nothing and he will only have himself to blame.",2024-03-14T23:04:02Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Em crise financeira, Y/Project chama Kanye West para divulgar coleção","Após anunciar que ficaria de fora do Paris Fashion Week, a Y/Project compartilhou um conteúdo virtual para divulgar a coleção de outono/inverno 2024. A marca, que estava anunciada como parte da programação da semana de moda, revelou que está enfrentando problemas financeiros e, por isso, cancelou o desfile desta temporada. Por isso, as novas peças são apresentadas por meio de um lookbook, que tem o rapper Kanye West como uma das estrelas.
Vem conferir!
Neste ano, a Y/Project completa dez anos sob o comando criativo de Glenn Martens. Para celebrar a data, a etiqueta tinha como propósito lançar uma nova coleção no Paris Fashion Week. Porém, semanas antes de começar o evento, a marca anunciou que está vivendo “tempos incertos” e abandonou o cronograma.
O lançamento de aniversário foi direcionado para um lookbook, publicado nessa terça-feira (12/3). Sediada na capital francesa, a marca convidou celebridades para o editorial.
Amigo de Martens há uma década, Kanye West, ou Ye, como passou a ser chamado, é um dos rostos da coleção de outono/inverno 2024 da Y/Project. A campanha chega após polêmicas do artista, que teve relação cortada com grandes marcas de moda, como Balenciaga e Adidas, devido a atitudes controversas e comentários preconceituosos.
Personalidades como Tyga, Charli XCX e Irina Shayk também posaram com as novas peças da Y/Project. Na coleção, códigos clássicos do estilista para a marca predominaram. Xadrez, couro e jeans estão entre os principais associados a caimentos não estruturados.
Y/Project
A Y/Project nasceu em 2011 a partir da mente criativa do designer Yohan Sarfaty. O estilista morreu dois anos após a estreia, vítima de um câncer. Glenn Martens assumiu os trabalhos e transformou a label em uma das mais conceituais e prestigiadas da indústria.
Ao longo da trajetória, celebridades internacionais vestiram peças da Y/Project. Na lista, estão Rihanna, Chloé Sevigny e Gigi Hadid, por exemplo. No repertório da etiqueta, também está uma colaboração que movimentou as redes sociais: com a etiqueta brasileira Melissa.
Apesar do sucesso nos últimos anos, a Y/Project alegou que está em uma fase complicada comercialmente. O período é de reformulação interna. De acordo com informações do portal WWD, o principal objetivo da empresa é encontrar um investidor que a apoie na manutenção e na expansão do negócio.",2024-03-14T18:30:00Z,https://www.metropoles.com,Metrópoles
Aus diesem Grund traf sich Kim Kardashian mit Bianca Censori,"Kim Kardashian (43) und Bianca Censori (29) könnten auf Versöhnung aus sein. Die Ex-Frau und die neue Liebe von Kanye West (46) wurden gemeinsam bei der Listening-Party zum neuen Album ""Vultures 1"" des umstrittenen Rappers gesichtet. Laut Daily Mail will nun ein Insider wissen: Kims Anwesenheit war Teil eines ausgeklügelten Plans, um eine ""vereinte Front"" mit Bianca zu demonstrieren. Es sei ihr wichtig, dass die Interessen ihrer Kinder an erster Stelle stehen. Die Reality-TV-Bekanntheit habe durch die Aktion zeigen wollen, dass sie die neue Ehefrau ihres Ex als Stiefmutter für ihre Sprösslinge akzeptiert.
""Es ist nicht so, dass Kim dafür nur kurz die Straße heruntergegangen ist. Sie ist extra nach San Francisco geflogen und Kanye war dankbar dafür"", erklärt die Quelle. Frieden zu schaffen sei ihr ein echtes Anliegen. Bianca sei zwar nicht der einzige Grund für Kims Besuch gewesen, jedoch habe sie definitiv im Hinterkopf gehabt, dass die Yeezy-Designerin ebenfalls anwesend sein würde. Die beiden Frauen haben wohl das Gespräch gesucht. Denn: Besonders bei den Kids soll Kanyes neue Liebe sehr beliebt sein.
Das Treffen der beiden Frauen findet vor dem Hintergrund statt, dass Kim und Kanye sich erst kürzlich wieder heftige Streitigkeiten geliefert haben. Der ""Can't Tell Me Nothing""-Interpret verlangte öffentlich, dass die The Kardashians-Bekanntheit die gemeinsamen Kinder auf eine andere Schule schicken soll. Dabei verriet er auch den Namen der Bildungsstätte der Promi-Sprösslinge. Um trotz solcher Vorfälle für Sicherheit vor Ort zu sorgen, bezahlt die vierfache Mutter der Schule bereits seit 2022 zusätzliche Sicherheitsmänner.

"Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign's 'Carnival' Remains at NO. 1 on TikTok Chart","Concurrent with its rise to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated March 16, “Carnival,” from Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and Ty Dolla $ign and featuring Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti, spends its second week at No. 1 on the TikTok Billboard Top 50.
The TikTok Billboard Top 50 is a weekly ranking of the most popular songs on TikTok in the United States based on creations, video views and user engagement. The latest chart reflects activity March 4-10. Activity on TikTok is not included in Billboard charts except for the TikTok Billboard Top 50. As previously noted, titles that are part of Universal Music Group’s catalog are currently unavailable on TikTok.
Trending on Billboard
“Carnival” remains the chart’s top song, becoming the first to reign for more than one week since Flo Milli’s “Never Lose Me” ruled for four frames between Jan. 20 and Feb. 10.
The song’s usage continues to largely revolve around its opening choir-led refrain and is used in a variety of ways, from lip-synching (usually in front of a mirror, known as the Carnival Mirror Trend) to soundtracking sports clips, gaming content, a dance trend and more.
“Carnival,” as previously reported, rises 4% in official U.S. streams to 33.7 million, assisting its ascension to No. 1 on the multimetric Hot 100.
The success of “Carnival” comes despite Ye’s various controversies, including recent and continued hate speech and antisemitic remarks that have caused some listeners to shy away from his material past and present.
The entire top five of the TikTok Billboard Top 50 remains both intact and in the same order, with Bobby Caldwell’s “What You Won’t Do for Love,” Djo’s “End of Beginning,” Kinfolk Thugs, GC Eternal and Tyme Bomb’s “Back It Up and Dump It (Dump Truck)” and Cat Janice’s “Dance You Outta My Head” rounding out the top five.
The rest of the top 10, however, is either made up of debuts or songs reaching the top 10 for the first time. They’re paced by Kaytoven’s “MONEY! (Money Money, Green Green),” which starts at No. 6. Released Feb. 24, the tune, which also sports slowed-down and sped-up versions on streaming services, had been teased on TikTok for weeks prior to its official release, sparking a strong premiere.
“MONEY!” has benefited from a variety of uploads using the sound so far, including some lip-synching to the “money’s all I need” chorus to explain why they care about their grades or work, while others soundtrack the “ew, look at that trio” challenge.”
AP$ENT’s “Can I Come With You” follows at No. 7. The Russian-language song (it translates to “Можно я с тобой”), originally released in 2022, has seen some of its biggest success in cat-related content.
Bryson Tiller’s “Whatever She Wants” starts at No. 8, while DeJ Loaf’s “No Fear” rises 16-9 and Cardi B’s “Like What (Freestyle)” rounds out the top 10. Tiller’s tune began being teased on TikTok in January and has seen a steady ascent since, concurrent with its move into the top 20 of the Hot 100, jumping 22-19 on the latest ranking. Its usage on the platform is mostly via lip synch and dance content.
“Like What” reaches the ranking as the song debuts at No. 38 on the Hot 100 following its March 1 premiere. Cardi herself got in on the action with one of the top-performing clips using the song so far, racking up over 1.7 million likes as of March 12.
See the full TikTok Billboard Top 50 here. You can also tune in each Friday to SiriusXM’s TikTok Radio (channel 4) to hear the premiere of the chart’s top 10 countdown at 3 p.m. ET, with reruns heard throughout the week.",2024-03-14T16:00:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"""Vultures 2"" Tracks Appear On TikTok & Instagram As Fans Await Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign's Album","When Kanye West delivers an album release date at this point in his career, few hip-hop heads are inclined to believe it. The father of four is notorious for hitting fans with delays, some of them even spanning months. We saw it with the original Vultures LP, which was set to arrive in late 2023 but didn't actually debut until February 10. The follow-up to that controversial project is expected to land this month, but as HipHopDX reports, there's some confusion about whether that will really happen.
Ye has already made it clear that Vultures 2 won't be available on streaming. Instead, he and his collaborators plan to sell the album online for $20 a piece – double the usual price. As we curiously wait to see if we'll be able to purchase Ty Dolla and West's work this New Music Friday (March 15), fans have noticed several titles from the tracklist appearing on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.

Will Vultures 2 Be Dropping Tonight?
""River,"" which features Young Thug and singer Leon Bridges has made it onto various apps, along with Future's appearance on ""Promotion."" Elsewhere, versions of ""Slide"" with James Blake and the rumoured Playboi Carti collab, ""Field Trip,"" which also includes Kodak Black, Lil Durk, and Don Toliver. According to @YeFanatics on Twitter/X, insiders are now saying these are ""ripped audio"" recordings, and could lead to delays in the official release of Vultures.
His work on Vultures 2 is certainly taking up a lot of Kanye West's time right now, but he's still making sure to put his family first. Earlier this week, the Yeezy founder and his firstborn, North, confirmed that her debut album is on the way, and it takes inspiration from one of her father's classic releases. Read all about that at the link below, and let us know if you think Ye and Ty Dolla Sign will be dropping this weekend in the comments.

Kanye West Debacle Leads To Adidas' First Annual Loss In Decades,"Kanye West and his Yeezy brand have been having a renaissance as of late. Overall, he is selling his products for just $20, and fans have been scooping up as much merch as possible. However, it has been a long rebuild for Ye, who was dropped by Adidas in the Fall of 2022. After all, he was begging to be let go by the brand. He was unhappy with the way he was being treated, and he was hopeful that his contract would be terminated. Meanwhile, he kept spewing anti-semitic talking points which made him a liability to Adidas' image.
Unfortunately for Adidas, letting Ye walk has come with a plethora of negative affects on their business. For instance, the brand has been posting sales losses every single quarter of 2023. In fact, the brand was forced to sell off close to $1 billion of leftover Yeezy products, just to get by. According to CNN, their latest numbers are pretty devastating. In 2023, the brand finished the year with a $63 million annual net loss. This is their first net loss in decades, and the Yeezy partnership's demise is a huge catalyst.

Adidas is also blaming a large tax bill and poor North American sales for their issues. The brand has struggled in America compared to the rest of the world, and with U.S. inflation on the rise, things have continued to worsen. However, it is expected that things will stabilize for Adidas, moving forward. Only time will tell if they can truly recover.

The model paired the cami with a pair of white lace tights and no underwear.

Kanye West and Bianca Censori’s Relationship Timeline,"Kanye West has always drawn on his relationships for inspiration for his music and fashion lines. The Yeezus rapper, 46, has found his latest muse in Bianca Censori. Ye has been married to the Australian-born architect for about 10 months now, but their relationship is still somewhat mysterious. In fact, people were unsure if they had even legally married until very recently.
As Ye and Bianca’s romance continues, get to know a little bit more about Bianca and look back on their romance, since the beginning.
November 2022: Kanye Drops ‘Censori Overload’
While Kanye and Bianca worked together for some time before going from a professional to a personal relationship, the lone hint that there may have been some spark came when Kanye’s song “Censori Overload” leaked in November 2022. The title is a play on his wife’s last name and the phrase “sensory overload.” While there are no definite references to his future bride on the track, some fans thought the lyric, “And the Bible said I can’t have any more sex till marriage” to be a hint at their future nuptials.
December 2022: Kanye and Bianca Get Married
When it comes to celebrity romances, usually there are at least a few hints about a relationship before they exchange vows, but Kanye’s relationship with Bianca first became widely known when the couple said, “I do.” The news of their wedding came just two months after Kanye’s divorce from Kim Kardashian was finalized. While the wedding came as a surprise for many fans, Bianca and the rapper had worked together for quite a while as she was the head of architecture for his Yeezy brand.
It was reported that Yeezy and Bianca had gotten married in secret, according to TMZ. After their reported secret ceremony, the pair were seen out and about on a few occasions, and they both had rings on their wedding finger.
At the time, it was reported that the pair hadn’t gotten a marriage license, meaning that their wedding wasn’t legally recognized. It was revealed that the pair had used a “confidential marriage” license, which kept it from the public record, according to Daily Mail.
January 2023: They Honeymoon in Utah
After the news of their wedding broke, it was reported that Kanye had taken the architectural designer on a romantic honeymoon to the Armangiri resort in Utah., according to Daily Mail. The resort costs about $5,000 per night, and the property is located on 600 acres in Utah’s Grand Circle of National Parks and Monuments.
After it was revealed that Ye and Bianca had secretly tied the knot, a few members of her family shared statements congratulating the pair. “It’s very exciting news for both my sister and the family but we choose to have some privacy for the time being,” one of her sisters Angelina told the Herald Sun. Her cousin Alysia also admitted that she was “super happy for them both.”
After the wedding, a source close to Kim revealed to Hollywood Life exclusively that she was indifferent to her ex’s new marriage. “Kanye did not tell Kim prior to getting married, so she does not know either way if this was legal but she is hearing that it was just a ceremony. She does not care either way and is not giving it any thought,” the insider said. “Kim does not care what he does with his romantic life, as long as he keeps up his duties as a father to their kids.”
A little over a week after Kanye and Bianca exchanged vows, it was reported that the couple was going to meet with his new bride’s family in Australia in a report by The Herald. The pair were heading to Melbourne so Kanye could “meet her family,” and they reportedly spent time where Bianca grew up.
January 2023: North West Joins Kanye and Bianca on a Date
Shortly after the news of their wedding surfaced, the pair were spotted out with Ye’s oldest child, North West, on a dinner date in Malibu on January 22. Kanye and Bianca arrived at Nobu for dinner, and shortly afterward, Kanye’s daughter was dropped off to join them.
June 2023: Bianca Celebrates Kanye’s 46th Birthday
A few months after the surprise of their wedding had settled down, Bianca seemed to settle into life with Kanye and his family nicely. When the rapper celebrated his birthday in June, a photo was snapped of her holding hands with North on the way to his party.
August 2023: Kanye’s “Cheeky” Outing With Bianca
The pair made headlines when they took a vacation to Italy in August 2023. During an outing, Kanye was seen bending over on a boat, but his rear end hung out of the bottom of his pants, as a boat of tourists sped by. Besides the memorable photo, the two were also spotted holding hands when not on the boat ride.
October 2023: Kanye Reportedly Tells Bianca Not to Speak
Despite Kanye’s marriage to Bianca being relatively new, a troubling report from Daily Mail about their relationship cropped up in October 2023. A source close to the designer told the outlet that Ye has a set of rules for his wife, including what foods to eat and clothes to wear. He’s also told her to work out and to “never speak.” The insider said that she just “obeys” Kanye, and she’s been “radicalized” by him. “She has no mind of her own anymore and obeys him because he has convinced her that they are royal,’ they said.
November 2023: Ye and Bianca Reportedly Split
The U.S. Sun reported that the couple were “taking a break” from their relationship because Bianca’s family allegedly didn’t appreciate how she became “all about Ye.”
February 2024: Kanye and Bianca Still Together
By early 2024, the pair had shut down breakup rumors, as they were spotted jet-setting around the world together. Bianca also was seen accompanying Ye to various events.",2024-03-14T14:25:42Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
Bianca Censori Showcases Her Curves In Sensual Photoshoot Orchestrated By Kanye West,"Bianca Censori and Kanye West have been married for over a year at this point. Overall, these two turned a lot of heads when they first got together. A lot of people were skeptical of their marriage. However, they have proven that they are very much in love with one another. Wherever Kanye goes, Bianca can be seen with him. In fact, she was even with Kim Kardashian a few nights ago for yet another Vultures listening party. At this point, the two are inseparable, and it has been cute to see.
One thing that Kanye loves to do with Bianca is coordinate some photoshoots with her. According to TMZ, Kanye posted some photoshoot images to social media recently. Although they appear to be deleted, the photos made their way to TMZ. In these images, the model can be seen wearing tight-fitting clothes that show off her curves. For instance, she dons a pink top as well as some white lacy leggings. In fact, it appears to be the same outfit she wore to the recent Vultures listening party.

Kanye West’s Wife Bianca Censori Poses in Braless Lace Outfit: Photos,"Kanye “Ye” West and his wife, Bianca Censori, appeared to have a spontaneous photo shoot, and the 29-year-old model slayed in her new look. In pictures that he shared to his Instagram Stories on Wednesday, March 13, the 46-year-old rapper revealed Bianca’s full ensemble: a rose pink braless top, white lace leggings and matching high heels. The front of the shirt featured small white bows down her chest, and the back had a criss-cross tie-up.
Ye made sure to snap various pictures while Bianca changed poses for the photo shoot. In a few of the snaps, the architect looked past the camera, seemingly at whomever took the pictures. She also turned away from the lens to showcase the back of her outfit.
Earlier this week, Bianca was spotted standing next to Ye’s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, at his Vultures album listening party. While it’s unclear if the two women spent much time together, social media clips revealed they stood side by side and appeared cordial at the event. Kim, 43, also brought along her and Ye’s son Saint. The ex-spouses also share children North, Chicago and Psalm together.
Ye and Bianca — who tied the knot in late 2022 — have made headlines for their mysterious marriage, as fans initially didn’t know much about the Australia native. Over the past year, the Yeezy designer has brought his wife to various events around the world and put together some of her outfits.
Last year, a report surfaced claiming that Ye and Bianca’s relationship was in trouble due to alleged tensions with her family.
“Her family has never been a fan of Ye, and those close to her have questioned whether marrying him was the right decision,” the U.S. Sun reported. “He is a very difficult person to be around and work for, and Bianca has been one of the most patient people ever to deal with him. She’s been all about Ye.”
Nevertheless, the duo is still together. Ye’s friend Justin LaBoy even claimed that he believed the “Stronger” artist and the Yeezy staff member will have children of their own.
“I think they’re going to have a bunch of babies,” Justin told TMZ earlier this week. “I love her. She’s great. She lives an amazing life. I’ve been around Ye for years now, and she’s extremely happy.”",2024-03-14T14:02:41Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
YesJulz Exposes Milo Yiannopoulos For Saying Kanye West Fans Have Down Syndrome,"YesJulz was thrust into the spotlight on Wednesday thanks to a letter that was sent to her by Milo Yiannopoulos. For those who may not know, Milo is the Chief of Staff over at Yeezy. Overall, he is mostly known for being a political provocateur. However, Ye now has him working for a music and streetwear empire. His involvement with Ye is truly bizarre although considering Kanye's political affiliations, it makes sense at least a little bit. Regardless, Milo was taking aim at YesJulz, claiming that she violated her NDA, all while having unauthorized conversations with Kanye fans.
Since this termination, fans have been waiting to hear from YesJulz. After all, it was revealed that she would have to owe $7.7 million in fines. Well, on Wednesday night, YesJulz unleashed the clip on Twitter. Below, you can see that she exposed some DMs from Milo. In these messages, Milo showed contempt for Kanye fans, saying that they have ""down syndrome."" ""Heres what Milo, the Chief of Staff who controls who gets hired + fired & when they get paid, thinks about the very fan base that fought so hard to get Ye his first #1 in over a decade,"" YesJulz wrote on X.

She subsequently said ""f*ck and NDA. Sue me."" Overall, this probably isn't the best strategy to deploy against Ye. However, there is no doubt that Milo's comments about Kanye fans are disturbing. When you consider Milo's political views, it shouldn't be surprising that he sees hip-hop fans this way. Quite frankly, he shouldn't be anywhere near the genre. That said, Kanye likes to do whatever he wants, regardless of how irrational it may be.

"Antonio Brown Teases Kanye West Remix Of ""Put That Sh*t On""","Antonio Brown has teased a remix of his song ""Put That Sh-t On"" featuring Kanye West. Brown revealed cover art for the single on X, formerly Twitter along with a the ""coming soon"" emoji as well as tagging West. The song was originally released in 2022 and gained a music video in 2023. While it never charted, it did enjoy a modicum of internet success. However, West is yet to confirm the report.
Furthermore, the promotion of his music sees Brown taking a breaking from his regular content - trolling for his CTESPN brand. However, Brown found himself in hot water over that last weekend. After posting a meme about LeBron James engaging in a threesome with members of the Lakers front office, Brown was accused of stealing a post from his replies. This has led fans to question just how many of the CTESPN posts are actually original content.

Antonio Brown Posts AI Art Of Him Kissing Taylor Swift
Elsewhere, Antonio Brown took shots at the Swifties as the controversial ex-NFLer posted AI art of Taylor Swift. The image shows Brown, decked out in his Steelers uniform, kissing Swift in front of a crowd of cheering Asian fans. Furthermore, Brown tagged Swift in the photo, as well as his CTESPN brand. However, fans were quick to note that Brown was likely about to face a wave of hate from the dedicated Swiftie fandom.
Of course, it's far from the first time that Brown has angered a popular figure's fanbase. In a shot at Swift last year, the former wide receiver recently tweeted out a picture of Ariana Grande in his Steelers jersey alongside Mac Miller's mother presumably getting ready for a Steelers game. “I had baddies at the game before the announcements…….. Arianators,” Brown captioned the photo. However, the picture did not go over well with Mac's fanbase. For many of Miller's fans, the inclusion of his mother takes the post beyond the pale. ""Nah you foul for this fam,"" one fan wrote. Another added, ""Don't disrespect Mac"". Brown even faced backlash from prominent fandom sources.

"Kim Kardashian y Bianca Censori, juntas en el último concierto de Kanye West","Quizá fuera más para apoyar a su hija North West ahora que ha dado a conocer, también en un concierto de su padre, que está trabajando en su primer álbum, Elementary School Dropout, pero la noticia es sin duda sorprendente: Kim Kardashian asistió al último espectáculo de Kanye West y lo hizo sentada justo al lado de la actual esposa del rapero, Bianca Censori.
Este pasado martes por la noche, la empresaria y fundadora de Skims hizo acto de presencia en el Chase Center de San Francisco, donde Ye realizó una de sus actuales ""fiestas para escuchar"" su nuevo disco, Vultures 1. Y, casualmente, le tocó compartir la experiencia junto a Censori, a quienes las redes consideran que el músico está ""obligando"" a parecerse a Kim.
En los vídeos que han salido a luz a través de las redes sociales, la más mediática de las Kardashian, de 43 años, no parece querer ocultar su tremendo aburrimiento, con un rostro entre tenso e inexpresivo y casi siempre pendiente de su hijo Saint, al contrario que Bianca, de 29 años, que iba cantando las letras mientras grababa el show con su móvil.
A pesar de estar juntas, eso sí, no parece que tengan una buena sintonía, dado que, según dichos vídeos, apenas si interactuaron en momentos determinados entre ellas y siempre entablando una conversación que ante todo fue corta, según los testigos. Por último, eso sí, se fundieron en un abrazo.
Hay que puntualizar además que recientemente salieron a la luz noticias de que Kim Kardashian detesta los controvertidos conjuntos que la modelo y diseñadora viste en público y en redes, muchos de ellos dejando poco lugar a la imaginación, por lo que puedan pensar sus hijos, delante de quienes, hace poco, hizo unas ""atrevidas"" decisiones estéticas, como explican desde el portal Page Six.
Aun así, las nuevas informaciones hablan de que Kim Kardashian, que estuvo casada con West desde 2014 hasta 2022, ha estado trabajando estos últimos días para tener una relación más amistosa con la nueva esposa de su exmarido por el bien de sus hijos, si bien se puntualiza que le ha costado acercarse a ella.",2024-03-14T09:20:32Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos
Bianca Censori et Kanye West bientôt parents ? Un ami du couple fait des révélations,"Crédit photo : Sansho Scott/BFA.com/Shutterstock
Kanye West et Bianca Censori font encore parler. La dernière polémique en date ? Les tenues osées et parfois jugées vulgaires de la femme du rappeur. Lors de la dernière Fashion Week à Paris, elle a notamment opté pour un collant totalement transparent, laissant apparaître ses parties intimes. Des choix vestimentaires qui sont loin de faire l’unanimité. Pourtant, l’interprète de Stronger continue d’être très épris de sa femme, malgré les critiques. Déclarant d’ailleurs qu’il était « très heureux » avec elle. Et alors qu’il est déjà papa de quatre enfants, se pourraient-il qu’à 46 ans, il le soit à nouveau avec la jeune australienne de 29 ans.
Kanye West et Bianca Censori, un bébé en route ?
Sont-ils heureux au point de vouloir fonder une famille ? La réponse est oui ! Du moins, si l’on en croit les propos du designer et ami de Kanye West, Justin LaBoy. De fait, il a partagé des informations auprès de TMZ concernant le couple qu’il forme avec Bianca Censori. Et il semblerait que les deux tourtereaux ne soient pas fermés à l’idée d’avoir des enfants prochainement. « Je pense qu’ils vont avoir un tas de bébés », a-t-il déclaré à nos confrères américains. Expliquant par la même occasion qu’ils étaient « plus heureux que jamais ». D’ailleurs, l’ami de Kanye West n’a pas hésité à dire ce qu’il pensait de « la femme de son frère ». Il confie : « Je l’aime. Elle est géniale. Elle mène une vie extraordinaire. […] J’ai côtoyé Ye pendant des années maintenant, et elle est extrêmement heureuse ».
Kim Kardashian et Kanye West parents de quatre enfants
Si Bianca Censori n’a pas eu d’enfants jusqu’à présent, ce n’est pas le cas du rappeur. De fait, avant son couple avec l’australienne, Kanye West a longtemps été marié à Kim Kardashian, avec qui il est devenu papa de quatre enfants. C’est en avril 2014 que les deux stars américaines s’étaient dit « oui » pour la vie. Soit un an après la naissance de leur première fille : North West. En décembre 2015, ils accueillent Saint, puis Chicago en 2018. Enfin, c’est en 2019, deux ans avant leur séparation, que le rappeur et la mère de famille accueillent dans la famille petit dernier : Psalm West. Depuis, bien qu’ils ne soient pas particulièrement en bons termes, les deux parents tentent de s’organiser pour la garde partagée.
Kim Kardashian et Bianca Censori très proches
Mais alors, où se situe Bianca Censori dans tout ça ? Contrairement à ce que l’on pourrait croire, il se pourrait bien que nous assistions à la naissance d’une belle amitié entre l’actuelle femme de Kanye West et son ex, Kim Kardashian. De fait, ce mardi 12 mars, les deux femmes ont été aperçues très proches lors d’un événement à San Francisco. Et ce, malgré les reproches et remontrances de Kim Kardashian à l’égard de l’australienne. En effet, elle aurait notamment pointé du doigt les tenues osées de Bianca Censori, ne voulant pas qu’elle s’affiche de la sorte devant ses enfants. Malgré tout, la femme du rappeur serait très proches de ses enfants et les deux femmes semblent ainsi avoir mis de l’eau dans leur vin. En somme, nous ne sommes pas à l’abri d’une belle petite famille recomposée… Mais bien sûr, ces choses-là demandent un peu de patience.",2024-03-14T09:07:20Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
"Kim Kardashian and Bianca Censori Get ""Chatty"" at Kanye West's Concert Looking Oddly Similar","Kanye West's ex-wife Kim Kardashian, and his present, Bianca Censori were spotting getting chatty at his concert. On Tuesday, March 13, 2024, the women stood in the stands of the Chase Center for Ye's listening party for his new album Vultures 2. And fans couldn't believe the uncanny resemblance between the two.

It seemed like a family affair as Ye performed alongside his collaborator Ty Dolla $ign and his 10-year-old daughter North West. Kardashian, who donned an all-black outfit for the event and tied her hair back in a bun, held her youngest 6-year-old daughter, Chicago West, in front of her, per The Sun.
Meanwhile, Censori stuck to her signature style and flaunted a pale pink top with a plunging neckline and bare back. She also had her hair back in a wet hairdo as she tried to lip-sync with her husband. The 29-year-old architect was accompanied by her mother, Alexandra, on one side, with sister Angelina, on the other.

The two were spotted chatting and looking comfortable in each other's presence. However, it wasn't their camaraderie that caught fans' attention but their similar faces. DJPharris shared the video on his Instagram account, and fans on a Reddit forum discussed how Ye's ex and his current wife look so alike.
A Reddit fan, u/Ambitious_Ad623, wrote, ""Kim looking like Bianca."" Another user, u/autozone_repair_hoes, added, ""One in the same."" u/Countdown2Deletion_echoed, ""They look related."" Meanwhile, other fans speculated why Kardashian was present at her ex-husband's concert.
u/Prior-Net-6090 theorized, ""These two have known each other a long time. Kimmy always felt threatened by Bianca and hated her working for Ye. She actually thought they were seeing each other on the sly."" Another fan, u/Exciting_Problem_593, said, ""Next thing will be Kim announcing how she and Bianca are BESTIES!!!!!""
A user, u/Uhhhhokthenn, added, ""It's not surprising. The 2 little kids are on stage, and it's not just North. Kim probably wanted to watch them."" u/vapidjuulia echoed, ""Avoiding each other would have been way worse for all. Especially for her kids who hold hands with Bianca,"" referencing the architect's recent outings with kids.
Kardashian has been seen with her new alleged boyfriend, Odell Beckham Jr., and the body language expert, Judi James told The Mirror both women seemed ""calm and un-troubled"" at the event. James said, ""Could this be the reason why Kim suddenly went public with Odell? It's always easier for current and ex-wives to meet up if the ex is happily paired up with her own partner.""
The expert continued, ""The ex and current Ms. West look relatively calm and un-troubled about sitting together to watch his show here, with their proximity suggesting a mutual desire to pitch themselves as friends. There is enough mirroring here, with matching hair and body poses, to show they are not in a combative or even competitive state, showing up like two fans of Kanye's, enjoying the concert.""",2024-03-14T07:02:06Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

Pela primeira vez Kim Kardashian e a nova esposa de Kanye West, Bianca Censori, foram fotografadas juntas. Kim mostrou apoio ao ex-marido ao comparecer com os filhos à festa de audição do próximo álbum de Ye, “Vultures 2”.
North West anuncia lançamento de álbum
Vídeos de fãs, que foram compartilhados nas redes sociais mostraram a empresária de 43 anos, ao lado de Censori, 29, durante o evento, que aconteceu no Chase Center, em São Francisco, na terça-feira, 12 de março.
Kardashian se manteve sutil em um conjunto todo preto, enquanto Censori optou pelo rosa.
Kim estava acompanhada por três de seus filhos: Saint, de oito anos, Chicago, seis, e Psalm, quatro, enquanto North, 10, não foi vista na multidão.

A festa de audição do álbum de terça-feira aconteceu dois dias depois de a primogênita do ex-casal anunciar que está se preparando para seguir os passos de seu pai na música.
“Estou trabalhando em um álbum”, disse North à multidão durante uma festa de audição, que aconteceu em Phoenix no domingo, 10 de março. “E se chama Elementary School Dropout”.

North fez o anúncio ao se juntar a West no palco do evento ao lado de seus irmãos.
Herança Musical
Ela disse ao público: “Estou trabalhando em um álbum”, comentou ao público enquanto estava no palco com o pai. “E se chama ‘Elementary School Dropou’ [abandono da escola primária].”
Aparentemente o título do primeiro álbum de North é uma homenagem ao aclamado álbum de estreia de Kanye, “College Dropout”, lançado há duas décadas.
Kim Kardashian quer que filhas assumam o controle das empresas
A menina já conhece bem a indústria musical, porque tem acompanhado o cantor em várias apresentações para cantar seu tema de estreia “Talking”, lançada recentemente por Kanye e Ty Dolla $ign, que alcançou a posição 30 no Hot 100.
O single fez dela uma das artistas mais jovens a aparecer no gráfico, segundo a revista “Billboard”.
Em 25 de fevereiro, North tocou “Talking” ao vivo durante uma festa de audição na Accor Arena em Paris.
No entanto, a data de lançamento do álbum ainda não foi anunciada.",2024-03-14T06:00:00Z,https://www.ofuxico.com.br,OFuxico
"Lo nuevo de Kanye West y el himno del Celta de C. Tangana, historia de una coincidencia","El artista, productor y músico Kanye West se ha convertido en meme y objeto de mofa por sus habituales declaraciones polémicas y excentricidades. Un escarnio en parte merecido, pero también injusto si tenemos en cuenta que se trata del autor de un disco considerado revolucionario, My Beatiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, creador de la multimillonaria marca Yeezy y organizador de aquellas delirantes misas gospel en su rancho de Wyoming, por poner solo algún ejemplo. Como afirmaba hace unos días el actor y músico Donald Glover (Childish Gambino) ante la pregunta de quién es en su opinión el mejor rapero de todos los tiempos: “Kanye. Sé que es controvertido, pero creo que de no ser por él no tendríamos a ninguno de los raperos de ahora”.
Vultures 1 es el título de su nuevo álbum que, tras mucha expectación y un lanzamiento caótico, que incluyó su retirada de plataformas por líos de distribución, enseguida se situó en el número uno de Spotify, Apple Music y la lista Billboard. “Somos número uno, ¿sabes? Todo lo que han hecho no ha hecho más que ayudarnos. Me gusta. Retiradnos. Me gusta la simplificación. De todos modos, las plataformas son una mierda para los artistas”, declaraba West en redes sociales la misma semana en la que emitió en el intermedio de la SuperBowl un cutrísimo vídeo selfi anunciando los productos de su web. Un original impacto publicitario que le reportó 19 millones de dólares en un solo día, según sus propios cálculos. Su última amenaza contra los gigantes del streaming es que cuando publique Vultures 2 quizá lo venda exclusivamente a través de Yeezy.com.
Una de las cosas que más llama la atención de su esperado trabajo junto al cantante Ty Dolla Sign es la participación de ultras del Inter de Milán vociferando en dos de sus canciones. El origen de este cameo de aficionados italianos está en un partido del Génova contra el Milan —justo, curiosamente, el rival ciudadano del Inter—al que asistió Kanye con su hijo Saint y en el que se quedó deslumbrado por el ambiente y cánticos futboleros de la afición. El mismo enamoramiento que vimos en otras estrellas del hip hop como Snoop Dogg, fan declarado del Real Madrid y coleccionista de equipaciones, o Drake, que vive prendado del Manchester United.
La cosa es que también el máximo referente de la música urbana en España, C. Tangana, es amante del balompié y más concretamente del R.C. Celta de Vigo, equipo de la ciudad natal de su padre. En julio de 2023, varios meses antes de la experiencia deportiva en el estadio genovés Luigi Ferraris que inspiró a West a la hora de meter berridos futboleros en su disco, el músico madrileño ya incluyó a miembros de una peña celtista haciendo coros en Oliveira Dos Cen Anos, el himno que compuso para el equipo gallego en su centenario. Las imágenes de los hinchas de Curva Nord Milano berreando con auriculares durante la sesión de grabación de la introducción de Carnival recuerdan a las de los siareiros de la peña Tropas de Breogán haciendo lo mismo en los estudios Planta Sónica de Vigo.
Sin llegar a la dimensión de Macarena, bailada hasta por Bill Clinton en los años noventa (y Hillary hace un mes en Sevilla), no cabe duda de que el nuevo himno del Celta ha tenido proyección internacional, siendo alabado por medios como The Guardian (“El himno de fútbol más ambicioso artísticamente de todos los tiempos”) y The New York Times (uno de los 10 mejores lanzamientos de la semana). Sería extraño que la canción no hubiese llegado a oídos de Kanye West o que incluso le entusiasmara tanto como a esa entrenadora personal de Arizona que subió a su cuenta de Instagram con un millón de seguidores el vídeo viral de una clase de spinning pedaleando al compás de: “¡Un escudo no meu peito! ¡Sempre celta!”. La hipótesis de si la obra de El Madrileño inspiró, aunque sea levemente y de forma inconsciente, al controvertido genio de Atlanta no es más que eso, una hipótesis. Y ni siquiera es relevante.
Y no lo es porque Pucho señala insistentemente sus limitaciones musicales, habla sin tapujos del síndrome del impostor y destaca que lo que se le da bien es “ver el talento de otros”. De hecho, en Oliveira Dos Cen Anos, no solo se sirve de ritmos ancestrales y tradición oral, sino que la construye con un dream-team de artistas que ya habían mezclado folclore y electrónica con el músico catoirense Baiuca.
Lo cómico es que no sería descabellado que Kanye West, impulsivo y fagocitado por su personaje, reprochase cualquier día a C. Tangana que los ecos de muiñeira y mujeres que golpean sachos de labranza en su cantiga celtista son una copia del arranque épico de su canción Power. O que las bengalas que desplegó en el vídeo junto a la ría de Vigo están copiadas del videoclip rodado por Romain Gavras para su tema No Church In the Wild. En cambio, Pucho, controlador y preciso en sus declaraciones, luce más sosegado y próximo a la teoría de una conciencia colectiva en forma de nube compartida de la que nos servimos para coger ideas.
Kanye West se inspiró en el Bundesadler alemán para crear el escudo de lanzamiento de 'Vultures 1', con el que ha estampado sudaderas y camisetas
El escudo de C. Tangana para el himno del RC Celta de Vigo combina el emblema del equipo con ramas de olivo, símbolo de la ciudad gallega.
Probablemente, Tangana reste importancia al parecido remoto entre el escudo de Vultures 1 con el que Kanye ha estampado sudaderas y el suyo para el lanzamiento del himno del Celta, que hoy lleva tatuado Iago Aspas. El infografista de The Washington Post Artur Galocha, cofundador de la revista Líbero y diseñador del libro del Celta 100 Anos de Afouteza e Corazón, ve semejanzas “en la elección del blanco sobre negro y en que los dos tienen esa forma clásica de escudo que viene de la heráldica”. Matiza que “el de Kanye es más obvio, menos trabajado, un escudo estereotípico que recuerda al Bundesadler alemán y es justo lo que te esperarías de un yanqui al que le gusta el fútbol”. El emblema celtista “está más trabajado, es casi una ilustración, con efecto desgastado y las ramas de olivo símbolo de la ciudad”, explica Galocha, inmerso justamente en crear la cubierta de La tribu vertical (Libros del K.O.), obra de Borja Bauzá sobre hooligans y bandas radicales.
Todo ese imaginario macarra de grada enfurecida es, según el divulgador musical especializado en rap Al Sobrino, “un movimiento muy Kanye”. El responsable de la plataforma El Sonidero indica que West “en la canción Off the Grid ya menciona a Lionel Messi y el fenómeno ultra conecta con las obsesiones que ha demostrado a lo largo de los años”. En ese saco entrarían “la moda desde un punto de vista del impacto popular, la cultura más callejera londinense, su conexión con Europa y su ya extinta relación con Adidas”. Añade que “su ADN es el trabajo colaborativo juntando a perfiles dispares bajo un mismo techo y la integración de momentos culturales en su obra”. Para ilustrarlo, pone como ejemplo los BRIT Awards de 2015, cuando subió al escenario al británico Skepta junto a decenas de encapuchados vestidos de negro y un par de lanzallamas. “Es la misma clase de energía y espíritu que persigue ahora”.
Tecleando “Kanye West” en el apartado de noticias del buscador aparecen los siguientes titulares: Los hijos de Donna Summer denuncian a Kanye West por usar ‘I Feel Love’ en una de sus canciones, Bianca Censori, esposa de Kanye West, podría ir a prisión por el conjunto que usó en la semana de la moda de París, Kanye West critica a Adidas por lanzar Yeezys falsos sin su consentimiento y Kim Kardashian harta de los señalamientos de Kanye West.
Ojalá pronto podamos leer este titular: Kanye West asiste de incógnito a un partido en Balaídos disfrazado de mascota del Xacobeo cantando Oliveira Dos Cen Anos junto a los aficionados de la peña celtista Tropas de Breogán.

Yeezy shoe sales lead Adidas to $150 million in donations to anti-hate groups,"Adidas said Wednesday that it’s donated or is planning to give away more than $150 million to groups fighting antisemitism and other forms of hate from the sales of Yeezy shoes last year after it severed ties with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.
The German sportswear brand had 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) worth of popular Yeezy sneakers piled up in warehouses after it broke off its partnership with Ye in October 2022 over his antisemitic and other offensive comments on social media and in interviews.
Adidas decided to sell some of the remaining shoes in batches, with two releases last year and another that launched late last month, and donate a portion of the proceeds to anti-hate groups.
The company has made donations to the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change, run by social justice advocate Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd.
Net sales of what’s left of Adidas’ former banner line of sneakers brought in about 750 million euros last year, compared with over 1.2 billion euros in 2022, the company reported.
Of the 300 million-euro profit it earned from the sales of Yeezy shoes last year, the company said it had given away or planned to donate over 140 million euros (about $152 million).
Adidas said deciding to sell a big chunk of its Yeezy inventory and improved operations helped it pull out operating profit of 268 million euros last year, a nearly 60% plunge from the previous year. It blamed a high tax rate for ending the year with a net loss of 58 million euros, a massive turnaround from net income of 254 million euros in 2022.
“Although by far not good enough, 2023 ended better than what I had expected at the beginning of the year,” said CEO Bjørn Gulden, who took over the top job last year.
Looking forward, Adidas expects to make about 250 million euros in sales of the remaining Yeezy shoes this year.
But the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company points to North America as a persistent problem spot, expecting revenue to decline in the mid-single digits this year and grow everywhere else. It said that North America was “particularly affected by the negative Yeezy impact” and that revenue there dropped 16% last year.
Adidas expects to almost double operating profit to about 500 million euros this year despite “macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions.” It plans to further scale up popular shoe lines like Samba that are seeing “extraordinary demand,” launch new ones and get a boost from major sports events like the Paris Olympics this summer.

Kanye West Has Fans Thinking They Found Playboi Carti’s Alt IG Account,"Fans believed they’ve discovered Playboi Carti’s private Instagram account after Kanye West followed someone with the username, “playboikitty7,” on the platform. After users rushed to follow the page, the person DM’d Ye to express their confusion. “Why you follow me?” they wrote in one message. “That scares me.” West then replied: “It accidentally does that.”
Fans shared plenty of laughs on social media in response to the incident. One user wrote on Twitter: “Fascinating how a simple digital mishap can spark a flurry of speculation and intrigue. The interconnected web we weave in the digital age truly knows no bounds.” Others weren’t buying the story. “That’s exactly what carti would say to distract us. DROP THE ALBUM NOW!” one fan wrote.

The confusion comes after Carti and Kanye collaborated multiple times in the last several months. On Ye's newest album, Vultures 1, Carti is featured on the hit track, ""Carnival,"" alongside Rich the Kid. The song debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. West also co-produced Carti's single, ""2024,"" which dropped in December. Check out Kanye's social media mishap below.

It comes following several other singles for his highly-anticipated third studio album, including ""Backr00ms,"" ""EvilJ0rdan,"" ""H00dByAir,"" and more.

Adidas registró pérdidas millonarias en 2023 tras el fin de su colaboración con Kanye West,"Las ventas de Adidas en América del Norte disminuyeron más del 16% durante 2023 (AP/Seth Wenig)
Adidas, la gigante alemana del deporte, se vio sacudida por una inesperada pérdida anual de 63 millones de dólares en 2023, afectada por la disolución de su rentable asociación con el rapero Ye, anteriormente conocido como Kanye West, en octubre de 2022, después de que este hiciera comentarios antisemitas, lo que provocó una importante disminución de las ventas en América del Norte y un substancial incremento en su carga fiscal.

De acuerdo con datos de CNN, el mercado norteamericano, como el segundo más grande para Adidas, experimentó una caída en las ventas superior al 16% a lo largo de 2023. Esta disminución se atribuyó en parte a la decisión de la compañía de reducir las ventas a mayoristas con el fin de disminuir sus altos niveles de inventario.
El director ejecutivo de Adidas, Bjørn Gulden, mencionó que las marcas europeas encuentran dificultades para competir en Estados Unidos en comparación con las marcas norteamericanas, destacando la necesidad de invertir más en deportes como el béisbol y el baloncesto para reforzar su reputación entre los consumidores estadounidenses.

Los esfuerzos por desligarse de la asociación con Ye llevaron a Adidas a tomar la decisión de vender el inventario restante de productos Yeezy anunciando la intención de donar una “cantidad significativa a organizaciones seleccionadas que trabajan para combatir la discriminación y el odio, incluyendo el racismo y el antisemitismo”. Este movimiento forma parte de las acciones de la compañía para mitigar el impacto después de la terminación de su colaboración con Kanye West.

Adidas se enfrenta a una situación fiscal desfavorable, con una carga de impuestos mayor que la del año anterior, aunque la empresa espera que esta presión sobre sus ganancias se alivie en el futuro. “Hacia adelante, la empresa espera que la tasa de impuestos se normalice nuevamente a medida que su beneficio operativo mejore”, se señaló desde la firma.
A pesar de haber registrado una pérdida neta, la compañía aún reportó un beneficio operativo de 293 millones de dólares el año pasado, lo cual representa una caída cercana al 60% en comparación con 2022, de acuerdo con datos del New York Times.

Por otro lado, Adidas ve un futuro prometedor en China, su tercer mayor mercado, donde las ventas crecieron más de un 8% el año pasado, logrando un impresionante aumento cercano al 37% solo en los últimos tres meses de 2023 en comparación con el mismo periodo de 2022. La empresa anticipa un crecimiento de dos dígitos en este país para el año en curso.

A pesar de los retos, el portafolio de calzado de Adidas, que incluye los populares modelos Samba y Gazelle, registró un aumento del 4% en las ventas globales. Este crecimiento contrasta con la caída del 6% en la venta de vestuario de la misma marca. Según reconoció el director financiero de Adidas, Harm Ohlmeyer, “no tuvimos un gran año en 2023″, reflejando la magnitud de los contratiempos que la empresa ha tenido que superar.",2024-03-13T21:47:25Z,https://www.infobae.com,infobae
Kanye West's Friend Says Rapper Is Going All In For North West's Debut Album,"It seems kids of famous artists are taking up after their parents and looking to pursue music in one way or another more often. Drake's son Adonis is one of the biggest examples, dropping his adorable freestyle ""My Man."" Of course, we cannot forget North West, who had a major contribution to Kanye West's album VULTURES 1 with ""TALKING."" Her memorable performance made the track one of the best on the record. While she still has a lot of growing to do, it is clear she has some real talent. That is what Kanye's friend, Justin Laboy, believes as well as he hyped up North West's debut album.
Of course, Ye's oldest child made the major announcement during the listening event in Phoenix a couple of days ago. It sent the internet into a frenzy, especially after she said the name of it will be Elementary School Dropout, evoking her father's debut. Like her dad, she has developed a serious fascination with music. ""She just naturally loves it,"" said Laboy, who was interviewed by TMZ, according to AllHipHop.

Ye’s putting everything, all chips in on her – production, the best engineers. I think she’s got it."" Additionally, he let slip about who would be on North West's tape. According to him, some of her friends have already recorded their vocals and North is coming up with at least 10 freestyles a day.
What are your thoughts on Kanye West's friend saying North West's debut album is getting the best producers and engineers? Are you buying into the hype for Elementary School Dropout, why or why not? Do you think ""TALKING"" is the best song from VULTURES 1? Will you check out the record when it drops?

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s Wife Bianca Censori Spotted Together,"It looks like all is cordial between Kanye West, his wife, Bianca Censori, and his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian. Kim, 43, and Bianca, 29, were spotted standing next to each other at Ye’s recent album listening party, according to a now-viral social media video. In the clip, the Kardashians star is seen enjoying the music while Ye’s wife is spotted leaning on the barricade alongside her.
While it’s unclear whether or not the women talked at the event, many social media users are pointing out that their hangout appeared amicable.
“Kim & ye getting they issues resolved [sic],” an X user tweeted on Wednesday, March 13. “The love of your life being cool w/ your soulmate >>” another chimed in. A separate person tweeted a photo of a person pointing to a sign that read “therapy” while writing in their post, “Y’all expecting them to be some sort of rivals need this.”

The reality TV star also brought her and Ye’s children along for the night. The ex-spouses — who were married from 2014 to 2022 — share kids North, Chicago, Saint and Psalm West.
Kim and Bianca’s apparently friendly hangout contradicts past rumors and reports, which claimed that the SKKN founder couldn’t stand Bianca. Considering that the model has been spotted spending time with her husband’s children on a few occasions suggests that the “Stronger” rapper, 46, and Kim have maintained some civility despite their past woes.
As for Bianca, she has made headlines over the past year for the revealing, unique outfits that she wore during various outings with Ye. Not only that, but a previous report also sparked speculation among fans that Ye and Bianca’s relationship was on the rocks.
In November 2023, The U.S. Sun reported that Bianca and Ye split allegedly because of tensions between her family and the Yeezy designer.
“Her family has never been a fan of Ye, and those close to her have questioned whether marrying him was the right decision,” the outlet reported at the time. “He is a very difficult person to be around and work for, and Bianca has been one of the most patient people ever to deal with him. She’s been all about Ye.”
Nevertheless, it appears the “Heartless” artist and the Yeezy employee’s marriage is going strong since they wed in late 2022. Meanwhile, Kim has been single since she broke up with her most recent ex-boyfriend, Pete Davidson, over the summer of 2022. She has been romantically linked with a few famous names, though, including Odell Beckham Jr., but the Hulu personality has not publicly addressed the rumors.",2024-03-13T19:07:25Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
Ungewohnter Anblick: Kim Kardashian feiert mit Kanye Wests Frau,"Seit Monaten macht Kanye West gemeinsam mit seiner Partnerin Bianca Censori Schlagzeilen. Meist geht es darum, dass die 29-Jährige kaum bekleidet an seiner Seite in der Öffentlichkeit erscheint. Wests Ex-Frau Kim Kardashian hat das bislang immer gestört. Jetzt aber feiern sie und Censori gemeinsam.
Dieser Anblick lässt ihre Fans irritiert zurück: Kim Kardashian, Ex-Frau von Rapper Kanye West, und ihre Nachfolgerin Bianca Censori sind erstmals gemeinsam in einem Video zu sehen. Wie die britische ""Daily Mail"" berichtet, zeigt der kurze Clip beide friedlich nebeneinander auf einer Record-Release-Party in San Francisco für Wests neues Album ""Vultures 1"".
Im Video wippen Kardashian und Censori hinter einer Bande gemeinsam im Takt, während Kanye West, der sich derzeit offiziell nur noch ""Ye"" nennt, auf der Bühne performt. Censori, Architektin aus Australien, ist seit 2022 in einer Beziehung mit dem umstrittenen Rapper, nachdem Kardashian von 2014 bis 2022 mit ihm verheiratet war. Wests gerade veröffentlichtes Album ""Vultures 1"" scheint bei beiden gut anzukommen, während ein gewisser DJ Pharris die kuriose Szene aus dem Backstage heraus festhält und in seiner Instagram-Story hochlädt.
Auch interessant anzusehen, ist Censoris Outfit. Während Kardashian sich modisch in dunklen Farben präsentiert, trägt ihre Nachfolgerin eine Art Ballerina-Catsuit in zartem Rosa. Was für die einen nur im Karneval denkbar wäre, zählt für Censoris Verhältnisse zur Kategorie ""dezent"". Sie und West sollen Ende 2022 in einer privaten Zeremonie geheiratet haben und fielen in den vergangenen Monaten immer wieder durch bizarre Aktionen in der Öffentlichkeit auf. West trug dabei häufig Outfits, die ihn von Kopf bis Fuß verhüllten, während seine Partnerin nahezu komplett entblößt auftrat.
Viel Spott für Bianca Censoris Outfits
Was Fans erstaunen dürfte: Kim Kardashian soll ein freundschaftliches Verhältnis zu Censori pflegen. Gleichzeitig ist sie Berichten zufolge kein Fan davon, dass diese ihre gewagte Mode vor den Augen ihrer gemeinsamen Kinder mit Kanye West zur Schau stellt. ""Kim hat Kanye angewiesen, dass Bianca sich niemals in der Nähe ihrer Kinder so kleiden darf"", so eine ungenannte Quelle gegenüber ""Daily Mail"". Kim Kardashian sei ""wirklich überrascht, dass Kanye seine Frau so aus dem Haus gehen lässt"". Während des Super Bowls am 11. Februar in Las Vegas wurde Censori in einem knappen Outfit fotografiert, das kaum ihre Brüste und ihren Hintern bedeckte und im Internet als ""Taco-Schale"" verspottet wurde. Nur wenige Tage zuvor trug sie einen durchsichtigen Regenmantel, unter dem sie nichts trug. Censoris Eltern sollen sich von Kanye West und den öffentlichen Auftritten ihrer Tochter ""gedemütigt"" fühlen.
Kanye West hingegen hat kürzlich die bizarre und manchmal obszöne Outfitwahl seiner Frau verteidigt - ebenso wie seine Entscheidung, Fotos von Censori auf Instagram zu posten: ""Ich poste meine Frau so oft ich will, Bruder"", schrieb er seinen 19,5 Millionen Followerinnen und Followern. ""Es macht mich glücklich. Manche Leute wollen nicht, dass du glücklich bist. Sie wollen, dass du sie glücklich machst. Ich habe mich entschieden, mich selbst glücklich zu machen, und ich bin glücklich damit"", so der Rapper.
Auch Kardashian soll er während der sieben gemeinsamen Ehejahre immer wieder Outfit-Vorschriften gemacht haben, allerdings in entgegengesetzter Hinsicht. Ihre Outfits seien ihm Berichten zufolge häufig zu sexy gewesen. Kardashians milliardenschwere Kollektion Skims hatte er einst als ""übermäßig sexualisiert"" kritisiert. Nicht zum ersten Mal lässt der 46-Jährige die Welt mit vielen Fragezeichen zurück.",2024-03-13T18:56:33Z,https://www.n-tv.de,n-tv NACHRICHTEN
Adidas und Kanye West: Wie das Unternehmen noch immer die Trennung verarbeitet,"Herzogenaurach. Man kann sagen, dass die Welt des Sportartiklers Adidas derzeit irgendwo zwischen Taylor Swift und Kanye West hin- und herschwankt. „Taylor Swift trägt manchmal unsere Produkte, ohne dass wir dafür bezahlen“, freute sich Konzernchef Björn Gulden zur Bilanz­vorlage am Herzogen­auracher Firmensitz. Wenn sich der US-Megastar in Schuhen oder Textil mit den drei Streifen der Franken zeigt, beflügelt das spürbar deren Umsatz. Sie als Marken­botschafterin unter Vertrag zu nehmen kann sich Adidas aber nicht leisten. Das Debakel mit einem anderen Promi ist für den Konzern indessen immer noch nicht ganz verdaut. Das liegt auch daran, dass jemand aus dem Umfeld des Skandal­rappers Kanye Wests nach einem Treffen mit Gulden ein Foto nebst toxischer Botschaft gepostet hat.

„Make Adidas great again“ war im Februar unter einem Instagram-Foto zu lesen, das West und Gulden in freundschaftlich anmutender Pose zeigt. Inzwischen ist es gelöscht. Mit West, der zuletzt sowohl antisemitisch wie sexistisch und rassistisch ausfallend geworden war, will Adidas eigentlich nichts mehr zu tun haben. Ende 2022 hatten die Franken eine Kooperation mit dem Mann, der sich heute nur noch Ye nennt und für die Franken eine hochlukrative Schuh­kollektion namens Yeezy entworfen hat, nach einer Serie von Ausfällen beendet. Die Nachwehen dauern bis heute an.
Gibt es ein Zurück für Ye und Adidas?
Das liegt zum einen daran, dass zur Zeit der Trennung die Lager voller Yeezy-Schuhe waren und die Produktion für sie auf Hochtouren lief. Die Bestände vernichten oder verkaufen, das war die Frage. Gulden ließ sie nach einiger Überlegung verkaufen. Die letzten Tranchen stehen in diesem Jahr an. Zum anderen aber ließen das Foto mit Ye und Gulden sowie die zugehörige Abwandlung des Donald-Trump-Spruchs „Make America great again“ Spekulationen aufkeimen. Gibt es für Ye bei Adidas doch ein Zurück?

„Nein, gibt es nicht“, stellte Gulden jetzt klar, was fast wichtiger war als die Bilanz des Vorjahres. Er habe Ye zufällig am Flughafen in Los Angeles getroffen. Es sei keine geschäftliche Zusammenkunft gewesen. Geholfen hat Ye 2023 Adidas dennoch. Der Verkauf seiner Schuhe hat dem Konzern im Vorjahr 750 Millionen Euro Umsatz gebracht. Statt ursprünglich erwarteter operativer Verluste brachte das dann doch 268 Millionen Euro Gewinn vor Steuern und Zinsen. Nettoverluste von 58 Millionen Euro konnten auch die Yeezy-Verkäufe nicht verhindern. Die Adidas-Umsätze dagegen blieben dank ihnen bereinigt um negative Währungs­effekte bei 21,4 Milliarden Euro nahezu konstant.
Das Yeezy-Erbe ist heikel. Der Verkauf der Schuhe eines bekennenden Antisemiten birgt für Adidas Reputations­risiken. 140 Millionen Euro Verkaufs­erlös will Adidas deshalb spenden oder hat es schon getan und dazu eine Stiftung gegründet, die über die Vergabe der Gelder autark entscheidet. Lieber als zurück blickt Gulden eindeutig nach vorne.
„Du schaffst das“ lautet der neue Adidas-Werbeslogan auch in eigener Sache
„2024 wollen wir den Sport feiern“, bekundet er. Mit Olympischen Spielen in Paris, der Copa America und der Fußball-Europa­meisterschaft in Deutschland ist dabei reichlich Möglichkeit. Zumindest von der EM erwartet sich der Adidas-Chef auch spürbar Zusatz­geschäft, ohne das beziffern zu wollen. Es ist stark abhängig vom Abschneiden der deutschen Elf, die zuletzt schon in den Vorrunden gescheitert war.
Die sportlichen Groß­ereignisse 2024 und innovative Sport­schuhe sollen dafür sorgen, dass Adidas die Umsätze währungs­bereinigt um etwa 5 Prozent steigern kann. Ähnliches plant auch der fränkische Lokalrivale Puma, womit die Marke mit den drei Streifen zumindest umsatzmäßig wieder im Gleichschritt wäre. Bei der Profitabilität ist man noch weit von der Branchen­spitze entfernt. Mindestens 500 Millionen Euro operativen Gewinn kündigt Gulden für das laufende Jahr an. Das wäre fast das Doppelte des Vorjahres. Um auf die 10 Prozent Zielrendite zu kommen, die Gulden für 2026 ankündigt, müssten es dieses Jahr aber gut 2 Milliarden Euro Gewinn sein. „Die 10 Prozent 2026 sind Ziel und Versprechen“, betont der Manager, der 2023 am Tiefpunkt der Krise von Puma zu Adidas gewechselt war.

"Despite Brouhaha With Kanye West Over Kid's Schooling, Bianca Censori And Kim Kardashian Totally Hung Out At Ye's Listening Party","Though the contentious divorce that ended the relationship between Kanye West and Kim Kardashian was finalized many months ago at this point, anyone with children will know that you don’t simply not see or talk to your former spouse once the romance is legally over. There will likely be frequent conversations, at least, over arrangements for the kids, and despite the ongoing brouhaha over where the Kardashian West children go to school , Bianca Censori and the SKIMS founder totally hung out at Ye’s listening party recently.
What Happened When Kanye West’s Wife, Bianca Censori, And Kim Kardashian Hung Out At His Listening Party?
Kim Kardashian (who’s been branching out and nabbing movie and TV roles more and more) has shown a pretty dedicated history of trying to publicly support her ex-husband as he launches his various projects. She attended multiple events for Kanye West’s Donda album release , and was even game, amidst the divorce proceedings, to head along on a joint family outing with Ye and their four children a while back. Now, Page Six reports that she not only attended his latest listening party, but hung out with her ex’s new wife, Bianca Censori, while there.
It was only on Tuesday night when the fashionable mom (who just wore a stunning structured dress to an Oscars afterparty ) hit up the listening party of Ye’s collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 1, at San Francisco’s Chase Center. Of course, tons of other people were in attendance, and social media videos show the sometime corset-wearer standing next to Censori, who is also known for daring outfit choices like wearing see-through leggings while going commando .
Footage does show the two women chatting a bit, but they didn’t appear to be engaging in any kind of girls’ night during the show, as Kardashian seemed to be either bored (at best) or strained (at worst) during the party, while looking mostly blank-faced throughout. Apparently, she had most of her attention on 8-year-old son Saint, who was also in attendance, as Ye’s spouse (whom he’s supposedly “banned” from social media ) sang along and used her phone to capture the show.
West has been vocal for a while now about his dislike of how Kardashian chooses to have their kids educated. It was just in January that he put up an Instagram post naming their exact school, ordering their mom to take them out of the institution and calling it “a fake school for celebrities that are used by ‘the system.’”
Meanwhile, it was in February that reports circulated that The Kardashians star had only one rule for her kids when interacting with Censori , and that was that West not let her dress in any of her extremely revealing looks while with them.
Whether that allegation is true or not, it does appear that the beauty mogul is trying to be as courteous as possible when her ex’s wife is around, and that’s probably the best for everyone involved.",2024-03-13T17:37:25Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Adidas plonge dans le rouge après son divorce avec Kanye West,"Adidas plonge dans le rouge après son divorce avec Kanye West
( AFP / JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX )
Le géant allemand de l'habillement sportif Adidas a subi en 2023 sa première perte nette depuis plus de trente ans, plombé par son litige avec Kanye West et par des stocks élevés, même s'il s'attend à une reprise progressive cette année.
Le groupe a fait état mercredi d'une perte nette part du groupe de 75 millions d'euros, après un bénéfice de 612 millions un an plus tôt. Les ventes globales ont connu un recul de 5% à 21,4 milliards d'euros.
Il s'agit de la ""première perte nette depuis 1992"" pour la marque aux trois bandes, a précisé un porte-parole à l'AFP.
Adidas appartenait alors à Bernard Tapie, qui l'avait acheté en 1990, avec l'aide des pouvoirs publics français.
L'entreprise allemande déclare avoir particulièrement souffert aux Etats-Unis des suites de l'arrêt des ventes du modèle Yeezy, selon un communiqué.
Adidas a rompu en octobre 2022 sa collaboration avec le rappeur controversé Kanye West, épinglé pour des propos à caractère antisémite, et a cherché depuis une solution pour écouler les milliers de chaussures qui ont fait le succès de leur collaboration durant des années.
Deux ventes partielles du stock de chaussures en 2023 ont certes permis d'encaisser près de 750 millions d'euros de recettes. Mais en comparaison, les ventes des Yeezy en 2022 avaient représenté 1,2 milliard d'euros.
Le groupe a également souffert d'une baisse de ses ventes aux grossistes en raison de stocks excédentaires importants, notamment en Amérique du Nord, où les ventes ont connu un repli de 21% au quatrième trimestre.
Adidas prévient qu'il s'attend, pour cette même raison, à un nouveau recul de ses ventes sur ce continent cette année, à hauteur de 5% environ, selon le communiqué.
-""Deux chiffres""-
""Cela va prendre du temps avant que la situation ne s'inverse"", a commenté le PDG du groupe Bjørn Gulden, lors d'une conférence de presse mercredi.
Adidas vise néanmoins en 2024 une croissance globale de l'ordre de 5% de ses ventes à taux de change constants, grâce à 250 millions d'euros de recettes liées à la fin attendue du déstockage du reste des baskets Yeezy.
Et après un démarrage attendu poussif en début d'année, la croissance accélérera en seconde partie d'année, atteignant un pourcentage ""à deux chiffres"", selon le groupe.
La Chine et l'Amérique latine verront en particulier leurs ventes progresser à un pourcentage à ""deux chiffres"" sur l'ensemble de l'année, et de près de 10% en Europe et sur les marchés émergents, toujours hors effets de change.
Le groupe compte également surfer sur la dynamique des grands évènements sportifs de cet été, principalement les Jeux olympiques de Paris et l'Euro de football en Allemagne, pour accroître ses ventes.
""Parce que les Jeux olympiques sont divertissants, les gens sont de bonne (humeur). Et quand ils sont de bonne humeur, ils achètent plus, donc c’est positif"", a estimé M. Gulden.
Le résultat d'exploitation doit lui atteindre 500 millions d'euros, comme communiqué début février.
En Europe, les ventes ont reculé au dernier trimestre 2023 de 7%, comparées à 2022 dopée par la Coupe du Monde de football au Qatar.
Malgré la perte subie en 2023, les actionnaires se voient proposer un dividende stable sur un an, à 70 centimes d'euros.
En Bourse, le titre Adidas gagnait près de 4,00% en fin de journée, après avoir perdu 1,38% en matinée.",2024-03-13T17:02:36Z,https://www.boursorama.com,Boursorama

Kim Kardashian y Bianca Censori fueron vistas juntas en la listening party del nuevo álbum de Kanye West,"La ex-esposa de Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, tuvo una conversación con la actual pareja de West, Bianca Censori Créditos: X/@PageSix
La “Vultures Listening Party” de Kanye West, con la que se celebró el lanzamiento de la segunda parte de su más reciente álbum, Vultures, ha dado mucho de qué hablar. Sin embargo, no fue precisamente la nueva música del rapero lo que invadió las redes, sino el esperado encuentro de su nueva pareja, Bianca Censori y su ex-esposa y madre de sus hijos, Kim Kardashian.
En el evento, Bianca Censori fue captada filmando la actuación en su teléfono, vestida con un top rosa, mientras Kim Kardashian estaba a su lado. Los hijos de Kim y Kanye, Chicago de seis años y Psalm de cuatro, también estaban presentes, al igual que North, de 10 años, y Saint, de ocho.
La presencia de Kim y Bianca juntas generó diversas reacciones en las redes sociales, donde los usuarios expresaron su sorpresa y curiosidad sobre lo que ambas podrían estar conversando. Usuarios incluso, reiteraron el gran parecido que hay entre ambas.
Después de que Bianca Censori y Kim Kardashian fueran captadas teniendo una conversación, los usuarios de redes han comenzado a lanzar todo tipo de comentarios y teorías sobre este momento
“Si yo fuera Kim no asistiría a nada relacionado con Kanye West”, “Kim se alegra de que él ya no sea su problema”, “Me encanta Kim. Ella siempre pone la mierda a un lado por sus niños”, “Mientras el hombre sea rico, las mujeres con las que se casó y abandonó seguirán rodeándole”, “Se divorció de él, pero aún no lo ha superado”, “Son mujeres maduras, ¿o qué? ¿se supone que se tiren del cabello?”, son algunos de los comentarios que los usuarios han compartido sobre este inusual encuentro.
Según fuentes, Kim Kardashian ha intentado mantener una relación de amistad y respeto con Bianca Censori. No obstante, se muestra crítica respecto a las elecciones de vestuario de Bianca, especialmente frente a los hijos que comparte con Kanye.
“Kim le dijo a Kanye que nunca dejara que Bianca se vistiera así cerca de sus hijos. Está realmente sorprendida de que Kanye deje a su mujer salir de casa así”, reveló una fuente cercana a Daily Mail.
Aunque Kim Kardashian busca tener una relación amistosa con Bianca Censori, también le ha pedido que no use sus escandalosos conjuntos en presencia de los hijos que comparte con Kanye West Photo © 2024 Best Image/The Grosby Group (En la foto, Bianca Censori pasea con la hija de Kim y Kanye, North, en París)
El propio Kanye West ha defendido públicamente las elecciones de moda de su esposa, así como su decisión de publicar fotos provocativas de ella en su Instagram, argumentando que busca su propia felicidad.
“Voy a publicar fotos de mi esposa tanto como quiera, hermano. Me hace feliz. Algunas personas no quieren que seas feliz. Quieren que les hagas felices. Yo decidí hacerme feliz a mí mismo y soy feliz con eso”, escribió el rapero en sus redes sociales.

Durante su matrimonio con Kim Kardashian, Kanye influyó notablemente en las elecciones de moda de Kim, quien ha hablado abiertamente sobre cómo la visión de Kanye cambió su estilo personal. Una fuente aseguró que el rapero está repitiendo los patrones que tuvo con su ex-esposa en Bianca, una situación que lamenta la más famosa de las Kardashian.
“Kanye hizo lo mismo que está haciendo con Bianca a Kim a lo largo de su matrimonio. La diferencia es que cuando Kanye vestía a Kim, era respetado como persona, como artista.’Desafortunadamente, Kim sabe por lo que Bianca está pasando - pero siente que Bianca debería haber sabido en lo que se estaba metiendo”, dijo la fuente sobre la influencia negativa que ha llegado a tener West en sus parejas.

Curiosamente, Kanye mostró en varias ocasiones su descontento con las sesiones de fotos más atrevidas de Kim Kardashian, ahora, parece disfrutar mucho de pasear con Bianca Censori usando prendas diminutas y escandalosas.
Otro de los momentos que más dio de qué hablar en el evento de Kanye West fue la revelación de su hija North, quien con tan sólo 10 años, debutará en la industria musical con el lanzamiento de su primer álbum de estudio titulado Elementary School Dropout.

"Rich The Kid Reveals The Roles For Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign On Upcoming LP ""Life's A Gamble""","Rich The Kid has been laying low for the majority of these last couple of years. However, 2024 appears to be the year that we get to hear more from the Queens, New York native. The big reason for that is his guest appearance on Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's VULTURES banger ""CARNIVAL."" It is has become one of the biggest tracks in hip-hop, but also in general. The song just went number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and it still sits atop the TikTok Top 50 as well.
However, Rich The Kid has plenty more going on than just that one track. Fairly soon, he will be returning with his first solo record in four years. Life's a Gamble is expected sometime this spring and there are lots of rumors swirling around who will be featured on it. But, according to HipHopDX, we can now officially say Rich The Kid will be working with Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign in some shape or form.

It would be revealed through a now deleted Instagram post from Rich in which he was also thanking people for getting ""CARNIVAL"" to go number one. In the caption we now know that Ye and Ty will be handling executive production duties. ""Thank you to all the fans, my family that always support love! #V2 & My album exec prod. by Ye & Ty$ OTW."" This is certainly exciting news, given the track record of the VULTURES creators. With all of this hype around Life's a Gamble, hopefully, it does better with the fans.

Une amitié à laquelle personne ne s’attendait en vue ? Kim Kardashian, l’ex de Kanye West, et Bianca Censori, la femme du rappeur, ont été aperçues ensemble. Et qui plus est, très proches, lors d’un événement ce mardi 12 mars. Un rapprochement étonnant au vu des circonstances et des récentes relations entre les trois stars. De fait, la mère de North West aurait, à plusieurs reprises, fait des reproches sur les tenues osées et vulgaires de Bianca Censori. Mais aurait-elle mis de l’eau dans son vin depuis ?
Kim Kardashian et Bianca Censori, nouvelles BFF ?
C’est lors de la soirée d’écoute de Kanye West, « Vultures 2 », à San Francisco ce mardi 12 mars, que les deux femmes ont été vues ensemble. Lors de cet événement au Chase Center, l’ex du rappeur, mariée avec lui jusqu’en 2021, a ainsi été aperçue en compagnie de Bianca Censori. A savoir, l’actuelle femme de l’artiste. Lors d’une vidéo prise au cours de la soirée, qui circule désormais sur la toile, nous pouvons les voir échanger et discuter, et non se disputer. Etonnant, non ? Particulièrement lorsque l’on connaît la nature de leur relation. Car oui, leur amitié n’était pas prédestinée, bien au contraire ! Depuis quelques temps, il semblerait que Kim Kardashian ne porte pas vraiment dans son cœur Bianca Censori. Et elle l’aurait fait savoir !

Les reproches de Kim Kardashian à Bianca Censori
Si les deux femmes semblent avoir une entente plus que cordiale, ça aurait pu ne jamais être le cas. De fait, il a été rapporté à plusieurs reprises, notamment dans les médias américains, que Kim Kardashian était loin d’approuver les choix vestimentaires de Bianca Censori. Pour cause, la femme de Kanye West a été aperçues plusieurs fois nue, ou quasi nue, dans la rue. Notamment lors de la Fashion Week de Paris. Evénement où elle ne portait qu’un simple collant transparent laissant apparaître ses parties intimes. Et si quelqu’un avait quelque chose à redire, c’est bien Kim Kardashian. Comme l’a déclaré une source au Daily Mail : « Kim a demandé à Kanye de ne jamais laisser Bianca s’habiller ainsi en présence de leurs enfants ». Mais au vu de cet événement, il semblerait que les tensions se soient finalement apaisées…
Kanye West déclare sa flamme
Et si Kim Kardashian a laissé passer, c’est bien parce que Kanye West ne semble pas prêt à quitter Bianca Censori. Bien que le rappeur soit accusé par les internautes de manipuler l’australienne de 29 ans, l’artiste semble très épris de sa femme. D’ailleurs, il n’a pas hésité à prendre sa défense après ses looks controversés. Mais aussi, à lui déclarer sa flamme. Ainsi, en février dernier, Kanye West écrivait sur les réseaux sociaux : « J’afficherai ma femme autant que je le veux. Cela me rend heureux. […] Certaines personnes ne veulent pas que tu sois heureux. Ils veulent que tu les rendes heureux, j’ai décidé de me rendre heureux et je suis heureux avec ça ». Voilà qui a le mérite d’être clair, à bon entendeur !",2024-03-13T15:37:34Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
Kanyes Ex Kim und Bianca Censori gemeinsam auf seiner Party!,"Verbrachten Kanye Wests (46) Ex-Göttergattin Kim Kardashian (43) und seine neue Liebe Bianca Censori (29) etwa den Abend zusammen? Die beiden Frauen wurden gemeinsam bei der Listening-Party zum neuen Album des umstrittenen Rappers gesichtet. In einem Instagram-Livestream sah man die beiden am Rand des Events. Nebeneinander wippten sie zu der Musik mit, unterstützten scheinbar den Künstler bei seiner Bühnenperformance der Songs von ""Vultures 1"" und machten Aufnahmen von dem Auftritt. Ob sich das Trio wohl zusammengerauft hat und es nun öfter gemeinsame Schnappschüsse geben wird?
Im Netz sind die Fans von dem unerwarteten gemeinsamen Auftritt der brünetten Schönheiten überrascht. Auf X nehmen zahlreiche User Bezug! ""Wir haben auch mehrere Ehefrauen, nur zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten"", zitiert eine Person eine Zeile aus einem Lied von Kanye. ""Was zur Hölle"", wundert sich ein anderer Nutzer. Vor wenigen Tagen sah das Ganze nämlich noch anders aus. Kanyes ehemalige Ehefrau soll nämlich mit einem neuen Mann, Footballer Odell Beckham Jr. (31), anbandeln und das passt Kanye wohl so gar nicht – und das soll wiederum seiner neuen Flamme Bianca ein Dorn im Auge sein.
Auch Kim selbst war zuletzt von dem Vater ihrer Kinder nicht begeistert – um genauer zu sein von seinen öffentlichen Angriffen ihr gegenüber. Der 46-Jährige hatte im Netz gefordert, dass die Reality-Bekanntheit den gemeinsamen Nachwuchs von der aktuellen Schule nehmen soll. Ein Insider verrät gegenüber TMZ, dass die Unternehmerin über sein Posting und auch über den Lösungsvorschlag nicht erfreut sei. Sie habe die Kids bei der Institution angemeldet, weil diese als ""fantastische Schule"" bekannt sei. Wenn es nach dem US-Amerikaner gehen würde, wären die Kids wohl bei ""seiner eigenen, nicht akkreditierten Donda-Schule"" untergebracht.

Tochter von Kanye West und Kim Kardashian: North West kündigt Album an,"Dass Mode-Queen Kim Kardashian eigentlich DER Hingucker ist, wo auch immer sie auftaucht, ist nichts Neues. Inzwischen stiehlt ihr Töchterchen North West aber immer wieder die Show
Von: Nico Nölken
Der Apfel fällt nicht weit vom Stamm: Mit gerade einmal zehn Jahren arbeitet North West, die Tochter von Kanye West (46), an ihrem ersten Rap-Album. Der Titel ist eine Hommage an ihren berühmten (und umstrittenen) Papa.
Auf der Listening Party für das neue Album von Kanye, „Vultures 2“, in Phoenix sprachen die Zuschauer am Ende mehr über seinen Nachwuchs als über ihn: North West kündigte nämlich an, dass sie an einem eigenen Album arbeite. Das berichtet das „Billboard“-Magazin .
North West mit Papa Kanye West, der seinen Ruf in den letzten Jahren mit antisemitischen Ausfällen ruinierte
Tausende Kanye-Fans waren von der Ankündigung der Nachwuchsmusikerin begeistert. Die Menge jubelte ihr zu, noch bevor sie zu Ende sprechen konnte.
Album ähnelt dem von Kanye West
Denn die Hörer kennen ihre Stimme schon – es ist nicht ihr erster Schritt in die Musikwelt: Bereits im Februar rappte sie einen kleinen Teil im Song „Talking/Once Again“ von Kanye West und Rapper Ty Dolla $ign (41).
Bei der Party verriet die Tochter von Kim Kardashian (43) dann auch schon den Titel des eigenen Albums: „Elementary School Dropout“ (zu Deutsch: Grundschulabbrecherin).
Eine kleine Frau mit großen Plänen: North West wird von Mama Kim Kardashian gefördert
Was nach Rebellion klingt, ist wohl eher eine Hommage an das Album von Papa Kanye: Dessen Debütalbum aus dem Jahr 2004 hieß „College Dropout“.
Damals war er DER Aufsteiger der Hip-Hop-Szene, doch diesen Ruf hat er sich selbst ruiniert: In den vergangenen Jahren fiel Kanye West wiederholt mit judenfeindlichen Ausfällen auf.",2024-03-13T15:09:00Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD
Do Kanye West & Bianca Censori Want Kids? Rapper's Inner Circle Gives Insight,"When word of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's plans to divorce first came out, fans of the longtime couple quickly began speculating who would move on first. Initially, the makeup mogul's connection with Pete Davidson proved she was ready to let go of her ex-husband. However, after plenty of social media beef throughout the seven months they spent together, the comedian walked away from his fling with Kardashian in favour of women closer to his age. Now, the mother of four seems to be spending time with Odell Beckham Jr, garnering many mixed reactions. As for West, he remains with his second wife, Bianca Censori, whom he reportedly hopes to have children with.
Yeezy didn't confirm this gossip himself, however, close friend Justin LaBoy did share his two cents on the matter with TMZ. He tactfully evaded the outlet's questions about Censori's nearly nude outfits, making it clear that he's not comfortable saying anything negative about the Graduation rapper and his girl. As you may recall, West has been lashing out at the media for suggesting he's controlling his other half by making her wear such salacious clothing. Even her Australian father, Leo, allegedly wants to confront the lyricist for not doing more to protect Bianca.

No matter how others feel, LaBoy said on Tuesday (March 12) that he's never seen Ye so happy. On ""Timbo Freestyle,"" the Atlanta-born entertainer rapped about ""another baby"" being his ""end goal,"" leaving listeners to ponder if the West family will be expanding. As far as LaBoy is concerned, he sees ""a bunch of babies"" in the cards for Yeezy and his 29-year-old wife.
On the topic of Kanye West, he's sure had a lot to say about his opps online lately. Drake is among those who caught strays from the father of four, but based on his response, we can assume that the Canadian is mostly unbothered. Read all about that at the link below, and check back later for more hip-hop/pop culture news updates.

Kim Kardashian & Bianca Censori Hang Out Together At Kanye West's Latest Show,"Kim Kardashian and Bianca Censori have one thing in common and that is the fact that at one point in their lives, they were married to Kanye West. Kim and Ye were married for about a decade, while Censori has been married to Ye for about a year. Overall, fans were surprised when they found out that Ye had remarried so quickly. However, he seems to be happy with Censori, and the feeling appears to be mutual. As for Kim Kardashian, she is currently dating Odell Beckham Jr., who plays for the Baltimore Ravens.
Interestingly enough, Kim Kardashian and Bianca Censori got to spend some time together recently. Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign have been hosting Vultures listening parties, and the two women found themselves at the most recent one. In the video down below, you can see that Kim and Bianca were both in the same section together. The two were in very close proximity to one another, and there appeared to be no issues. It was pretty cool to see, although who's to say what was going through their minds at the time.

As some commenters pointed out on The Neighborhood Talk, Kim was likely there to support North West. After all, North is planning to drop a new album soon. There is no telling what kind of album this will be or how it will sound. However, the concept of a North West LP is definitely intriguing. We're sure Kanye West is very proud, and we imagine he will also look to produce it.

Drake Hilariously Responds To Kanye West Diss With Iconic 50 Cent Meme,"Drake and Kanye West have been embroiled in a feud for quite some time. Although they seemingly squashed the beef a few years back, it seems like the truce was short-lived. Drizzy has thrown subliminals at Ye over the last couple of years, and on Monday, West launched a huge rant that included Drake. In fact, during this rant, Kanye took shots at Adidas and the fashion industry at large. It was a very passionate paragraph that ended with some shots at Drake, who took Lil Durk with him on tour.
“That’s how I feel And it’s fuck Drake for taking Durk right at the beginning of the Vultures role out I’ll come back to yall if I think of more fuck you’s,” Ye said. The Canadian megastar clearly saw this callout as he took to his Instagram story yesterday with a response. Instead of addressing Ye directly, he decided to refer to what was said. Below, you can see that he posted the iconic 50 Cent meme in which the artist says ""what he say f*ck me for?"" It was a nice subtle response that shows how the artist isn't too pressed right now.

On any given day, there is a chance that you wake up to a new rant from Kanye. That has been true for decades at this point, and his targets have learned to just accept it. This wasn't the first time Ye has gone after Drake and it probably won't be the last. You just have to learn to go with the flow and understand that tomorrow, Kanye will probably feel differently than he did today.

"Kanye West Has Milo Yiannopoulos Fire YesJulz From Yeezy Team, Milo Claims She Owes $7.7 Million In Debt","Kanye West and Milo Yiannopoulos first teamed up with one another back in 2022. For those who have no idea who Milo is, he is a political provocateur who came to prominence in 2016. Overall, he became known for his white nationalist takes and his love for Donald Trump. Despite not being from America, he had this America-first attitude that Conservatives loved. Although he was ultimately exiled for a few years thanks to his takes on pedophilia, he reappeared next to Ye in 2022.
This coincided with Kanye's deep dive into anti-semitism. It was all very bizarre and fans were not happy with the direction. Subsequently, Ye distanced himself from Milo and it seemed as though they were no longer working together. However, it is clear that Milo is still very much on the Yeezy payroll. We know this because, on Tuesday night, Milo wrote a letter to YesJulz in which he fired her from the Yeezy team. As Ye explained on his Instagram, the famous publicist was having unauthorized engagements with fans and brands on social media.

In Milo's letter, which can be found below, he tells YesJulz that she never signed her NDA. As a result of this violation, she currently owes $7.7 million in debt to the Yeezy company. Moreover, the sign-off on the letter shows that Yiannopoulos is currently the Chief Of Staff for Yeezy. This was news to a lot of fans, and overall, some have voiced their displeasure with Milo's continued employment. As for YesJulz, she had been a huge part of the Vultures rollout. Now, however, she will no longer be present at any events as Ye and Milo look to distance the Yeezy brand from her actions.

"Kanye West Deletes Post After Taking Aim at Hailey Bieber, Leaving Fans Puzzled","Kanye West, famous for his candid outbursts, caused a stir recently with a swiftly deleted Instagram tirade. In the now-vanished post, the 46-year-old rapper targeted a slew of individuals, including model Hailey Bieber, while celebrating his chart-topping album, Vultures 1. West initiated his diatribe by expressing gratitude to his supporters, dubbing them as individuals resistant to manipulation by the system.

As per the reports of Mirror, amid his ire, West accused Adidas of attempting to dismantle him. He exclaimed, “This number #1 is for you it’s for the people who won’t be manipulated by the system and f**k Adidas and everybody who works there or with them. Anyone who goes to school with anyone who’s parents work at Adidas. Just know they tried to destroy me and here we are with the number 1 song in the world. And f**k everybody at the Dailey Mail (sic). And f**k everybody at the fashion houses that sided with Gabby and Hailey Bieber. F**k each and every single one of yall. And f**k every Christian that watched me have my kids taken out of my control. That’s how I feel.” he concluded, “I’ll come back to yall if I think of more f**k you’s.”
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hailey Rhode Baldwin Bieber (@haileybieber)
As per The Sun, many were confused by West’s inclusion of Hailey Bieber in his diatribe, questioning the rationale behind singling her out alongside other targets. Some fans speculated that West’s reference to ‘Gabby’ pertained to Vogue editor Gabriella Karefa Johnson, known for mocking West’s controversial attire choices. Bieber’s previous defense of Karefa-Johnson may have placed her inadvertently in West's line of fire.
One fan wrote, ""Bruh everyone is collectively dragging this woman now. If Ye ever named dropped me I’d die. But we know they have beef because didn’t Hailey say something when Ye was being anti-Semitic a couple of years ago and then he called her Hailey Baldloose… ?"" Another added, ""Point being YE is the founder of the name baldloose. He also outed her nose job and that she’s not a real model just a nepo who gets jobs because of the circle she’s in not her actually being worthy.""
A third concluded, ""Being called out personally and dissed by the most famously unhinged personality who disses women of a particular religion... I'll snark but tbh, by reverse Uno card this is good for her.""

Fans and commentators expressed concern for West's mental well-being, suggesting that his erratic behavior could be a response to personal struggles, including his ex-wife Kim Kardashian's reported romantic involvement with Odell Beckham Jr. Many lamented West's downward spiral and called for him to seek professional help.

"Adidas posts first annual loss in 30 years, warns sales in North America would fall again","Open this photo in gallery: Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden speaks during a news conference in Herzogenaurach, Germany, on March 13.Daniel Karmann/The Associated Press
German sportswear giant Adidas posted its first annual loss in more than 30 years on Wednesday and warned sales in North America would fall again as sportswear retailers in the U.S. struggle with high inventories.
Adidas has been battling to right itself after it cut ties with Kanye West in October 2022, suspending sales of the highly profitable Yeezy sneaker line.
In CEO Bjorn Gulden’s first year in the role, he resumed sales of Yeezy sneakers to clear remaining stock while seeking to boost popular products like Samba and Gazelle shoes, and improve relationships with retailers. Shares in Adidas have staged a recovery, outperforming Nike NKE-N and Puma since he took over.
“Although by far not good enough, 2023 ended better than what I had expected at the beginning of the year,” Gulden said.
Adidas shares were trading flat as of 1115 GMT.
This year North America will continue to be weak with Adidas expecting sales to fall by around 5 per cent this year.
Lower demand and overstocked stores in the U.S. have weighed on sportswear and apparel companies, and Adidas said sales in North America fell by 21 per cent in the fourth quarter and by 16 per cent over the year.
Overall, Gulden said clearing stock through its outlet stores helped Adidas bring inventories down by €1.5-billion in 2023, a 24 per cent decline.
Adidas has flagged shipment delays of two to three weeks due to the Red Sea crisis, and Chief Financial Officer Harm Ohlmeyer said on Wednesday that there could be an impact on working capital if the disruptions continue.
Adidas is gambling that it can claw back market share from rivals even as consumers’ overall appetite for sportswear declines, sparking job cuts at Nike.
Adidas expects its underlying business – excluding Yeezy – to improve in 2024, with growth of at least 10 per cent in the second half.
It has benefited from a trend for low-rise suede “terrace” sneakers like the Samba and Gazelle, and last year ramped up production. That trend helped footwear sales grow by 8 per cent in the fourth quarter, while apparel sales fell 13 per cent.
“Things have clearly been going in the right direction at Adidas since Bjorn Gulden took over,” said Thomas Joekel, portfolio manager at Union Investment. “Brand heat is increasing, which can also be seen from the fact that fewer products now have to be sold at a discount.”
In China Adidas expects a stronger recovery, with sales growing at a double-digit rate after an 8 per cent increase in 2023.
Adidas last month set expectations low for its remaining Yeezy products, saying it would sell the sneakers “at least at cost.” It launched its latest drop on Feb. 26, but demand for the shoes is difficult to predict.
The Yeezy sales are “still a little bit of a wild card,” said Cristina Fernandez, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, despite the company managing the sales successfully so far.
Adidas made €750-million in revenue from Yeezy sales last year, resulting in a 300 million euro profit. The company set aside €140-million for donations to charities fighting antisemitism and racism.
Adidas’ board will propose an unchanged dividend of 0.70 euros ($0.7650) per share on its 2023 performance despite a net loss of €58-million, its first since 1992.",2024-03-13T11:20:41Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail

Kim Kardashian was spotted hanging out with Kanye West’s wife Bianca Censori at the rapper’s “Vultures 2” listening party in San Francisco Tuesday night.
The Skims founder, who was married to West from 2014 to 2021, was seen talking with the controversial rapper’s wife, 29, during the star-studded event at the Chase Center.
In video footage taken at the listening party, Kardashian, 43, stood alongside her children Chicago, Psalm and Saint, next to the former architect, 29, as West performed.

Kardashian was seen wearing an all-black ensemble for the outing, meanwhile Censori, for her part, rocked a pink tank top with white tights.
It’s understood that Kardashian and Censori have an amicable relationship, however, it took the beauty mogul, who shares four kids with West, some time to come around to her ex’s new wife.
More recently, it’s been reported that Kardashian is not a fan of Censori parading her risqué fashion choices in front of her children.
In recent months, Censori has been seen out and about while wearing little to no clothing, with outrageous outfits ranging from sheer tops and tights, to going completely commando in public.

“Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids,” a source previously told Daily Mail. “She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.”
What’s more, Censori’s father reportedly wants to confront the rapper over fears he is tearing his daughter away from her family and turning her into a “trashy commodity.”

The rapper, for his part, has defended his wife’s fashion on social media, despite mass outrage and fears that he’s “controlling” her by posting half-naked images of her on Instagram.
“Ima post my wife as much as I want bro. It makes me happy,” he wrote in February. “Some people don’t want you to be happy. They want you to make them happy I decided to make myself happy and I’m happy with that.”",2024-03-13T11:16:14Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six

Although he refused to speak about “my brother’s wife” in any specific way, LaBoy told the outlet that the couple are happier than ever.
“I love her. She’s great. She lives an amazing life,” LaBoy, 32, shared. “I’ve been around Ye for years now, and she’s extremely happy.”

The Yeezy architect and North, 10, have held hands while attending events together and even have taken trips to Disneyland.

The co-parenting outing comes just a couple of weeks after the “Jesus Walks” rapper begged the “Kardashians” star to take their kids out of their “fake” school.
A source told Page Six that Kardashian was “frustrated with his constant public attacks and naming of the school” by her ex because it “creates security and safety concerns each and every time for their children.”
“The school that the kids attend is a fantastic school,” the insider tells us. “She wishes this to be a private matter and Kanye would not continue to take his grievances and turn them into public matters on social media.”",2024-03-13T11:10:38Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
Κιμ Καρντάσιαν και Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι πρώτη φορά δίπλα-δίπλα σε συναυλία του Kanye West -Άφωνοι οι φαν [εικόνες],"Η Κιμ Καρντάσιαν και η Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι βρέθηκαν για πρώτη φορά μαζί σε δημόσιο χώρο και μάλιστα σε συναυλία του Kanye West για την προώθηση του νέου του άλμπουμ.
Η πρώην και η νυν στάθηκαν δίπλα-δίπλα στο Vultures Listening Party του γνωστού ράπερ, ένα party event για τον εορτασμό του τελευταίου άλμπουμ του, Vultures 1.
ΤΟ ΑΡΘΡΟ ΣΥΝΕΧΙΖΕΙ ΜΕΤΑ ΤΗΝ ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ
Η 29χρονη Μπιάνκα αυτή τη στιγμή έχει σχέση με τον 46χρονο αμφιλεγόμενο ράπερ, ενώ η 43χρονη Κιμ ήταν παντρεμένη μαζί του από το 2014 έως το 2022.
Η cool Κιμ Καρντάσιαν δίπλα στη νέα σύντροφο του Kanye West
Σε ένα βίντεο από την εκδήλωση που κάνει τον γύρο του Διαδικτύου, η νεαρή αρχιτεκτόνισσα φορά ένα τιραντέ ροζ τοπ και βιντεοσκοπεί το φαντασμαγορικό σόου με το κινητό της ενώ η γνωστή ριάλιτι σταρ φορά μαύρο δερμάτινο και στέκεται δίπλα της παρακολουθώντας. Μαζί τους είναι και τα παιδιά της Κιμ και του Kanye.
Οι θαυμαστές σοκαρίστηκαν βλέποντας τις δύο γυναίκες η μία στην παρέα της άλλης και αντέδρασαν στο βίντεο που κοινοποιήθηκε στα social media και έγινε γρήγορα viral.

Η Κιμ Καρντάσιαν λέγεται ότι έχει φιλική σχέση με την νέα σύντροφο του πρώην συζύγου της. Ωστόσο, φέρεται να μην της επιτρέπει να ντύνεται πολύ προκλητικά μπροστά στα τέσσερα παιδιά της τα οποία μοιράζεται με τον Kanye West.
«Η Κιμ έδωσε εντολή στον Kanye να μην αφήνει ποτέ την Μπιάνκα να ντύνεται έτσι μπροστά στα παιδιά της», είπε μια πηγή στην Daily Mail.
Η γεννημένη στην Αυστραλία Μπιάνκα έχει φωτογραφηθεί με μια σειρά από σέξι, αποκαλυπτικά ρούχα από τότε που παντρεύτηκε τον 46χρονο ράπερ τον Δεκέμβριο του 2022, λιγότερο από ένα μήνα μετά την οριστικοποίηση του διαζυγίου του με την Κιμ.

"Kanye West's Marriage to Bianca Censori Predicted to Last 'Another 6-12 Months,' Says His Collaborator","Despite some early setbacks, Kanye West and Bianca Censori's marriage is still going strong. The couple is frequently spotted showing off their love as they head to different bars for West's Vultures 1 Volume 1 album listening parties. But according to Adam Glove, the proprietor of a high-end pub, their union won't endure much longer than six to twelve months. ""I mean, depends on your definition. Maybe six months, a year,"" he exclusively told The US Sun at the Dream in Gold Oscars After Party.
Kanye West addresses critics saying he posts about his wife Bianca Censori too much:

The owner of Affinity Nightlife also commented on West dressing Censori in offensive X-rated attire, which the architect's Australian family is said to have found concerning. ""She's just like a mannequin,"" Glove shared while also revealing that the young architect is okay with it and likes the attention. ""I think she's happy. She likes the clout."" Describing his collaboration with the Donda rapper on the nightlife scene, he said, ""I mean, it's hard. I'm Jewish. But creatively, he's a genius. He's a really good marketing person, but a little disrespectful at times,"" referring to West's controversial anti-Semitic rants.

Glove's event company will be supporting Ye and Ty Dolla $ign at a significant Rolling Loud After Party in Los Angeles after their concert on March 14. In celebration of Rolling Loud's tenth anniversary, the two are taking over Hollywood Park Grounds. A source claims that because of his contentious reputation, West has been advised he cannot perform in concert halls in Europe, Asia, or Australia. ""His reputation and the controversies in the last few years are the main reason for this,"" a source said. ""Now almost no companies that manage arenas or stadiums want to allow him to do shows on their venues.""

Censori's family is worried about their daughter, yet, over the weekend, the former model and her husband were spotted at a Vultures listening party. As per The US Mirror, her parents are doubtful of West being an affectionate father. ""There was a time when her parents were supportive of her having children with Kanye, but no one believes at this time that her becoming pregnant and having a baby right now is a good idea,"" a source revealed while adding. ""They want Bianca to have children and they want grandchildren, but they want them to grow up in a stable and loving household. Life with Kanye is not stable at all.""

He goes on to say that she has the appearance of a ""trashy naked trophy pony"" and that Kanye has made her into a ""trashy-looking marketable commodity."" However, a source claimed Censori is keen on having children with the Bound 2 rapper, ""He is her husband so of course she has talked about this, and being a stepmom to Kanye's kids has really only made her desire to have kids stronger,"" the source said.",2024-03-13T10:09:03Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

"North West, la hija de 10 años de Kim Kardashian y Kanye West, anuncia su primer álbum","En el último concierto, en Phoenix, en el estado de Arizona, ofrecido por su padre, Kanye West, la primogénita del rapero y de Kim Kardashian hizo un sorprendente anuncio que fue vitoreado por los presentes: está siguiendo los pasos de Ye y se encuentra trabajando en su primer álbum, del que ha revelado el título.
Con apenas 10 años de edad, North West ya tiene claro que su camino dentro de la familia Kardashian es el artístico y por eso lanzará Elementary School Dropout, que así se llama el disco [que se podría traducir como Abandonar la escuela primaria], en un futuro, si bien no concretó ninguna fecha.
""He estado trabajando en un álbum"", dijo la menor, acompañada de su padre, entre los aplausos de la multitud, ""y se llama Elementary School Dropout"", añadió, provocando más entusiasmo entre los presentes, dado que es una referencia directa al primer disco que sacó al mercado Kanye, The College Dropout, con el que consiguió dos premios Grammy a Álbum del Año y a Mejor Álbum de Rap.
Además, según informan desde el portal de música Billboard, sus hermanos pequeños Chicago y Psalm se le unieron sobre el escenario para bailar su canción Talking, la cual se incluye en el último trabajo de Kanye, Vultures 1. Se desconoce por qué no estaba su otro hermano, Saint West.
Gracias a este tema, a inicios de este año, North West llegó al Top 100 de Billboard. La voz de la joven nepobaby suena al comienzo de la pista, y se hizo bien conocida desde entonces su presentación ""It's your bestie, Miss, Miss Westie"".
La joven ya ha demostrado que quiere aunar en ella las dos ramas de los negocios de sus padres, pues le encanta la moda, dejándose ver en los desfiles de la Paris Fashion Week junto a su madre y protagonizando la portada de la revista i-D, así como quiere prepararse para dirigir los negocios de su familia, ya que ella misma dijo que le interesaría estar al frente de Yeezy algún día —y su madre explicó que estafaba a sus amistades con un puesto de limonada—.",2024-03-13T09:29:16Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos
When Kanye West Created a Scene By Making Bianca Censori Pose With Locals in Florence in a Bold Outfit,"Controversial rapper Kanye West caused a storm while shopping in the bustling city of Florence. The 46-year-old was out and about with his architect wife in Via dei Calzaiuoli, Italy, on Thursday, September 21, 2023. Suddenly, a flock of people emerged for a picture with her, so he turned photographer and directed his wife to pose with the enthusiastic locals.

The 28-year-old took center stage surrounded by overzealous fans in a body-hugging leotard styled with sheeny pantyhose outfit fitting perfectly on her well-endowed body, which she paired with pointy kitten heels, reported by Daily Mail. The doting husband adjusted the angles mid-breaks to ensure a perfect shot of his beautiful wife from his iPhone.
The famous couple are no strangers to the streets of Italy. A few weeks back, they were caught in a ""questionable"" position while riding a river taxi in Venice. Their graphic display surfaced online and caused a stir, which prompted the authorities to ban them. Apparently, the disrespectful incident showcased Ye exposing his bare buttocks while Censori knelt with her head in his lap.

During this time, the architect slick back her brunette locks and neatly tucked them behind her ears. Her makeup included a bold smokey eye look, nude lips with plenty of gloss, and an excess of luminous bronzer. The Australian beauty got clicked in multiple poses, including one with a hand on her hip as West happily clicked her with admirers.
She paired her outfit with no jewelry except a rare snail-shaped Braccialini handbag crafted with antique gold hardware and dark green leather, which cost a whopping sum of $2,035. The Praise God rapper opted for his signature black colored baggy T-shirt, pants, and Yeezy sneakers. His face was covered with a black long-sleeved t-shirt, which he tied as a scarf.
After satisfying fans with plenty of pictures, he ushered his wife into the Graziella Braccialini store, a luxury brand founded in Florence, Italy, renowned for its well-crafted luxury goods. Despite the security, he traveled a short distance, acting like his wife's 'personal' guard. Inside, the A-lister was greeted by the brand's staff while the couple enjoyed a tour.

The duo had eyes for a few items, including a reptile-shaped bag with funky graphics, which seemed to have pleased Censori. Ye and his wife are currently on their grand Europe tour, one of the stops being their dubious boat ride in Venice. Police investigation revealed the driver of the river taxi had been identified and will be questioned.
A source from the Venice police department revealed, ""There are standards of public decorum that have to be followed by tourists and locals alike, and any breaches are severely punished."" It added, ""The images of West with his trousers down while in a taxi as he and his partner crossed the lagoon were seen all over the globe.""
Elisabetta Pesce, councilor for public security in Venice, told the outlet, ""Without any shadow of a doubt, what we saw from the couple was a lack of respect for Venice, which is the most enchanting city in the world.""

"Kim Kardashian, Kanye West's 10-Year-Old Daughter North West Announces Debut Album","The entertainment world is abuzz with the latest announcement from North West, as the eldest daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, steps into the limelight with news of her debut album. At just 10 years old, North made a surprise appearance at one of her father’s listening parties, where she revealed her upcoming album titled Elementary School Dropout. The moment, captured on video and shared widely on social media, has ignited a flurry of reactions, ranging from curiosity and excitement to scepticism and concern.
In a clip shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), North confidently took to the stage, announcing to the crowd, “I’ve been working on an album, and it’s called Elementary School Dropout.”
With her father Kanye West by her side, the young starlet soon exited the stage to thunderous applause.

However, North’s announcement has not been without its critics. Some have questioned the appropriateness of a 10-year-old releasing an album, while others have raised eyebrows at the title, which seems to echo her father’s debut album, The College Dropout.
Among the sceptics, one commentator on X expressed apprehension, saying, “So she dropped out of Elementary School?? Shouldn’t it make sense?”

“This is the funniest thing I’ve seen today! Protect her at all costs and don’t let the evil music industry get to her,” wrote another person.
Despite the scepticism, North has also found plenty of supporters rallying behind her. Fans have flooded social media with messages of encouragement, hailing her as a potential popstar and expressing anticipation for her album’s release. One enthusiastic supporter wrote, “College Dropout is still in my top 5 of all time…good luck to North on Elementary School Dropout,” while another admired her relationship with Kanye and said, “This father-daughter relationship.”

Earlier, North West performed live and has often joined her father and step-mom Bianca Censori on stage. She took to the stage in February with Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign when the listening event for Vultures was held.
Whether she can live up to the expectations placed upon her remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure– the world will be watching as North takes her first steps into the spotlight.",2024-03-13T06:13:50Z,https://www.news18.com,News18
Adidas Will Donate Millions To Anti-Hate Groups From Sale Of Kanye West’s Yeezys,"Topline
Adidas will donate $150 million from the sales of Kanye West's Yeezy shoe line to groups that combat antisemitic hate, the company said Wednesday, a move that comes after Adidas and other brands severed ties with the rapper after a series of offensive comments in 2022.
View of the Adidas Store in Soho on Feb. 10, 2015. GC Images
Key Facts
Adidas recorded a roughly $330 million profit off of Yeezy inventory in 2023 after the brand ended its roughly $1.5 billion deal with West, the Associated Press reported, and is expected to make another $270 million selling the remaining stock this year. Donations have so far gone to the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change. Wednesday's announcement came as Germany-based Adidas posted its first annual loss in more than three decades and warned investors that North American sales will likely continue to fall in 2024, with an estimated 5% drop in the region over the year. Adidas reported an operating profit of $293 million in 2023, a 60% drop from the roughly $731 reported last year, but still higher than expected.CEO Bjørn Gulden said 2023 ""ended better than what I had expected at the beginning of the year,"" largely thanks to the Yeezy sell off. Shares of Adidas were trading at $105.35, up almost 2%, ahead of the market open Wednesday.
Big Number
$1.3 billion. That's how much Adidas' Yeezy stockpile was said to be worth when it broke off its partnership with West.
Key Background
Kanye West, who now goes by the name Ye, made antisemetic comments and make bizarre comments about Jewish people in interviews and social media posts in October 2022. Soon after, brands like Balenciaga, Adidas, Gap and Foot Locker dropped their deals with the musician, his wax figure was removed from Madame Tussauds and several athletes cut their ties with West's Donda Sports.
Tangent
West dropped out of the public eye for months after the controversy and appeared on stage again for the first time in August of 2023 alongside Travis Scott in Rome. In November of last year, he performed his song ""Vultures"" live for the first time in Dubai, including a line that seemed to address the backlash with the lyric ""How am I antisemitic?” before adding a vulgar description of having sex with a Jewish woman. The Anti-Defamation League and American Jewish Committee condemned what they called a ""particularly pathetic and sad"" resurfacing of anti-Jewish rhetoric. West in December of 2023 ""sincerely"" apologized to the Jewish community and said it was ""not my intent to hurt or disrespect, and I very much regret any pain I may have caused."" West released his first album since the controversy, called ""Vultures 1,"" with Ty Dolla $ign in February. The album immediately shot to the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart and lead single “Carnival” debuted near the top of the Hot 100. The album grossed more than $1 million in its first week, according to Billboard.
What To Watch For
Another album. ""Vultures 2"" was slated to be released last week but missed its expected date.
Forbes Valuation
The end of his deal with Adidas saw West drop off the Forbes billionaires list in October of 2022. The end of the partnership is estimated to have cost West $1.5 billion. He was worth an estimated $1.8 billion in 2021 and $2 billion in 2022. He's worth an estimated $400 million today.

"Mase Shares Bold Amber Rose Theory, Notes Kanye West & Wiz Khalifa Made Their Best Music With Her","Mase theorized that Amber Rose has been the catalyst for some of the best hip-hop music in the last two decades. He discussed the music Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa made while in a relationship with her during the latest episode of It Is What It Is.
“Every time Amber got with somebody, they made the best music of their life. Think of the music Ye was making with her,” Mase said. “Think of [‘We Dem Boyz’]. That was when Wiz was with Amber. And 21 did his thing when he was with Amber, right? N****s made some of their best music.” His co-host, Cam’ron, took issue with the take, arguing that each artist was making good music before dating Rose. “She didn’t find them because they were nice guys,” Cam’ron said. “They were making good music before she got with them.

Kanye West slams critics who 'tried to destroy' him as 'Carnival' single hits No. 1,"After his latest single “Carnival” hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart Monday, you can’t tell Kanye West nothing.
Indeed, the rapper and hip-hop mogul celebrated his fifth chart-topper — which also features Ty Dolla $ign, Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti — by slamming everyone from Drake and Hailey Bieber to his former Yeezy collaborators at Adidas and all of his perceived enemies “that watched me have my kids taken out of my control.”
“Rich Ty Carti and the supporters that stood by us though everything This number #1 is for you it’s for the people who won’t be manipulated by the system,” wrote West in a since-deleted Instagram post full of “f–k you’s.”
“I’ll come back to yall if I think of more f–k you’s,” said Kanye West at the end of his since-deleted Instagram post. Getty Images
Then West — who officially changed his name to Ye in 2021 — proceeded to rip into Adidas, which dropped his Yeezy line in 2022 after he had made a series of antisemitic and other controversial remarks.
“f–k adidas and everybody who works there or with them,” he wrote.
“Anyone who goes to school with anyone who’s [sic] parents work at adidas. Just know they tried to destroy me and here we are with the number 1 song in the world.”
West’s Insta diatribe continued by lashing out at those who backed Vogue contributing editor Gabriella Karefa-Johnson and Bieber for criticizing his “White Lives Matter” T-shirts in 2022.
“And F–k everybody at the fashion houses that sided with Gabby and Hailey Bieber,” he wrote. “F–k each and every one of yall.”
“Vultures 1,” West’s new album with Ty Dolla $ign, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 last month. Spotify
Then West — who has four children with ex-wife Kim Kardashian — spewed his venom toward “every so called Christian and so called friend or so called family member that watched me have my kids taken out of my control.”
Lastly, West — whose “Vultures 1” collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign debuted atop the Billboard 200 last month — had one last “f–k you” for Drake: “And it’s f–k Drake for taking [Lil] Durk right at the beginning of the Vultures role [sic] out.
“I’ll come back to yall if I think of more f–k you’s.”",2024-03-12T19:36:28Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
What It Hitting No. 1 Means,"If the chart-topping first-week debut for Vultures 1 wasn’t sign enough that Ye (previously known as Kanye West) was once again back at the mainstream’s center, three weeks later we get an even surer sign: “Carnival,” the set’s lead single, has ascended to pole position on the Billboard Hot 100 in its fourth week.
It’s Ye’s first No. 1 on the chart since 2011 — when he was featured on Katy Perry’s fourth consecutive Teenage Dream Hot 100-topper, “E.T.” — and his first as a lead artist since “Stronger” in 2007. (It’s also his first major hit since receiving extreme backlash for his repeat antisemitic comments, for which he posted an apology in Hebrew in December.) Meanwhile, it’s the second visit to the top for co-lead Ty Dolla $ign, following his appearance on Post Malone’s “Psycho” in 2018, and the first for both of its featured artists: Playboi Carti and Rich the Kid.
Trending on Billboard
Who does the No. 1 mean the most to? And does this mean Ye’s back at the vanguard of pop music like he was during his biggest years? Billboard writers discuss these questions and more below.
1. “Carnival” is not only the first Hot 100 No. 1 for Ye since 2011 — since 2007, if you don’t count his not-particularly-immortal appearance on Katy Perry’s “ET” — and by most measures, his first true smash in at least a half-decade. On a scale from 1-10, how important is it for him at his point in his career to have an old-fashioned HIT-hit like this?
Kyle Denis: I think it depends on how you look at it. Did Ye need a true smash hit in 2024 to cement his overall legacy? Absolutely not. Did Ye need a true smash hit in 2024 to re-establish himself as a viable commercial force (particularly in terms of singles) in the mainstream? Yes. So, let’s go with a 6.5-7.
Angel Diaz: Five? Ye is going to be polarizing whether his music is good or not. The old Ye is gone and is never coming back. While I do think it’s cool to see him go No. 1 again, I’m not sure its’s going to matter in the grand scheme of things. I do think this is his best post Pablo album, though. Someone as talented as Mr. West will always have a puncher’s chance.
Carl Lamarre: If we’re speaking on Ye’s ego, a 10. Being able to dribble past his antisemitic comments and his feud with Adidas takes hall-of-fame precision. Not only did he land his 11th consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with Vultures last month, but now he can hoist a No. 1 song on the Hot 100, all while playing the game as an independent artist. For someone as audacious as Ye, expect his turn-up and ego to match that same energy.
Michael Saponara: 6. I don’t think Ye necessarily needed a smash as he’s always going to be an influential figure in society’s mainstream and connect with his fan base. However, becoming the first rapper to earn a No. 1 in three different decades and doing it independently at 46 has turned heads and legitimized his methods to the madness creatively. If anything, the mainstream acclaim is only going to embolden his voice when it comes to future decisions, for better or worse. Even the haters have to respect what “Carnival” has accomplished without much radio play and playlisting in a genre that’s lacked serious hitmakers in recent years.
Andrew Unterberger: An 8. Obviously Ye was going to be a major voice in music and culture for many years to come even if he never had another big pop hit — but having one, especially at a time when even major rappers are finding a lot more trouble scoring runaway hits than they maybe used to, shows that he still knows what really moves the mainstream in 2024. He’s certainly taking it as a major win himself, as evidenced by the ill-advised victory lapping he’s been doing on IG this week.
2. While the headlines about “Carnival” will always be Ye-focused first and foremost, three other artists also add a No. 1 to their tallies with the single: Ty Dolla $ign’s second, and the first for both Playboi Carti and Rich the Kid. Which of those three artists do you think has the most to gain from the song’s massive success?
Kyle Denis: Probably Carti. He’s had proper hits in the past but as he’s delved deeper into his own idiosyncratic rage rap sound, traditional hits have proven a bit more elusive for him. This is a good look for him as he prepares for his next record and his long-delayed Antagonist Tour. As for Ty and Rich the Kid, a No. 1 is a towering achievement no matter how you slice it, but neither performer is the kind of artist that *needs* to top the Billboard Hot 100 to retain their fanbase and interest in their music.
Angel Diaz: Carti 100 percent. He already has the youth and almost every new rapper these days is either influenced by him or is currently biting his style while sounding like “We got Playboi Carti music at home.” He should take advantage of this moment and drop the follow-up to his cult classic Whole Lotta Red, which is already four years old. Also, because we need more “schyeah” content.
Carl Lamarre: Rich the Kid with Ty coming in second. For many mainstream listeners, Rich’s most significant moments came during the 2017-2018 era when he unleashed “New Freezer” with Kendrick Lamar and “Plug Walk.” Though he had some highlights here and there, to the public eye, he drowned in oblivion until Ye tossed him a lifeline. The talent for Rich has always been there; he just needed the right opportunity, and on “Carnival,” he made the best out of it.
Michael Saponara: Rich The Kid has been hibernating from the charts the last few years and he’s caught a lifeline with “Carnival” which RTK deserves a lot more credit for than Rap Radar co-host Elliott Wilson seemed to be giving him, in my opinion. With a No. 1 hit to his name, Rich will have more eyeballs on him than usual, which wouldn’t have been the case without his Vultures standout feature. Spending time around Ye and Ty will be a positive from a creative perspective, and it makes sense they’re capitalizing on the momentum and executive-producing his forthcoming project.
Andrew Unterberger: Can only speak for myself here, but I certainly didn’t know that Rich the Kid still had the juice like that. Considering he’s only even touched the Hot 100 once this decade prior to “Carnival” — at No. 91 for precisely one week with the Lil Wayne collab “Feelin Like Tunechi” — I’m guessing he’s putting this No. 1 pretty high up on the updated CV.
3. Considering none of Ye’s past three projects have produced a breakout hit nearly on the level of “Carnival,” what do you think it is about this song that’s allowed it to achieve liftoff the way it has? Is there one thing in particular it does that puts it in league with past Ye hits on this level?
Kyle Denis: It’s definitely the catchiest Ye single since the Life of Pablo era. The gospel-tinged tracks on Jesus Is King were always going to be hard sells – even though “Follow God” debuted in the top 10 – and the biggest tracks on Donda had their hit potential marred by a messy release and a comparatively less favorable period of public opinion for the rapper.
Most importantly, however, Ye tapped into youth culture with “Carnival” and took a literal back seat. He only has one verse on the song, while Carti (who has a massive cult following) and Rich the Kid take up most of the airtime. It feels like a latter-day Ye record without containing too much of his actual voice; you don’t even hear Ye at all on the part of the song that’s gained the most traction (the hook). By having rappers from a younger generation anchor “Carnival,” Ye found the perfect primer for the song to be embraced by the TikTok streets, hence the plethora of trends that have helped the song stay viral on the platform. And, for what it’s worth, the general public sentiment towards Ye has gotten a tiny bit kinder since his last LP.
Angel Diaz: Playboi Carti is the easy answer here too. The kids love that dude. The honest answer, though? It’s an anthem. The football goon chant, the production, the unexpected Rich the Kid feature, the way Ty floats during his verse, Ye’s mid verse about being cancelled or whatever, and Carti kinda, sorta sounding like a mystery rapper all makes for an unusual banger.
Carl Lamarre: Even though it didn’t chart as high as “Carnival,” I thought “Follow God” was a banger and underappreciated. For the former, it’s a matter of everybody playing their position to a tee and allowing the record to morph into this behemoth. The song has such bounce that it can elevate anything vibe-wise, ranging from a mosh pit to an intense workout. It can adapt and thrive in any environment. Expect this song to be a festival gem and sports arena go-to.
Michael Saponara: I think “Carnival” builds off the stadium rage Ye initiated with Yeezus, which superstar artists of today like Travis Scott and Playboi Carti have carried the torch for and engrained it in rap’s mainstream. Those two, specifically, are members of the West family tree, and were clearly influenced by the futurism and rebelliousness of Yeezus. While Ye is often ahead of the curve, “Carnival” was digestible enough for hip-hop fans to spread like wildfire.
Andrew Unterberger: Same thing that’s been true from Steam to Zombie Nation to Usher: Never underestimate the power of a good stadium chant. Especially considering most of Ye’s new material literally makes its debut in stadium surroundings these days, it’s a natural fit that a bunch of soccer hooligans leading a partially R-rated singalong would go over with “We Will Rock You”-sized returns for him in 2024.
4. “Carnival” has proven far and away to be the biggest breakout success from Vultures 1 so far. Do you think there’s likely to be another major hit from Vultures — and if so which track do you think is the most likely candidate?
Kyle Denis: In my head, “Do It” is the next hit from Vultures. But that all depends on how quickly the other two Vultures projects arrive.
Angel Diaz: It’s a toss up between “Paid” and “Vultures” for me. When was the last time we got a payday anthem? I feel like artists would mention getting paid on a Friday just in time for weekend club shenanigans in every other song back in the day. Johnny Kemp’s “Just Got Paid” immediately comes to mind, and I first thought that was the sample used at the end — but it’s actually from the Jodeci track “Get on Up” which is referencing Kemp’s hit record with the line “Friday night, let’s all get paid.” So it all comes full circle to me saying we need more payday music.
Carl Lamarre: “TALKING” has grown on me A LOT. If I’m Ye, I’m already trying to start the North West roll-out for her upcoming debut album. Imagine being hip-hop’s first father-daughter combo to have top 10 records in a calendar year. I’m also a huge fan of “BURN.” I can hear that song on a Rush Hour 4 or Bad Boys 4 soundtrack. It’s vintage Yeezy with a mid-90s, early 2000s feel.
Michael Saponara: Not on Vultures 1, but other songs he’s been teasing definitely have hit potential. The Backstreet Boys-interpolating “Everybody” has been a fan-favorite at listening parties for months with the catchy chorus trading the ’90s boy band for Uncle Charlie Wilson. We’ll see if they can sort out potential clearance issues. Aligning more with the current landscape of rap, Ye and Ty have another possible banger in the arsenal with the slimy tentatively titled “Field Trip/Venom” featuring the versatile ensemble of Playboi Carti, Don Toliver and Lil Durk as guests. Those two would be my picks if they receive a proper streaming release on Vultures sequels.
Andrew Unterberger: Could definitely see “Paid” striking a vein, and the North parts of “Talking” could certainly find their way to a TikTok trend or two. But being real, Ye and Ty are already turning their attention to Vultures 2 — as will their fans in turn, no doubt — so anything that hasn’t broken out from 1 yet will probably have to wait for a random six-years-from-now revival, if anything.
5. Now that the re-mainstreaming of Ye seems to be complete (for better or worse) following the major backlash of the past few years, do you see him once again being at the forefront of popular music like he was for most of the past two decades? Or has he been gone too long and done too much damage in recent years?
Kyle Denis: Ye has curated an audience that’s markedly different from the one that he pissed off with his antics over the past few years. For that reason alone, I think he’ll comfortably remain an unignorable figure in popular music. However, I don’t foresee him truly recapturing the cultural zeitgeist the way he did during his peak in the ‘00s and early ‘10s. If anything, he’ll probably continue to get more hits by way of strategic collaborations like “Carnival.” Does he get a legitimate solo smash in the coming years? I’m not sure I’d put my money on it quite yet.
Angel Diaz: I want to say that he’ll be back on top, but I’m not sure he’s into success these days. Ye seems to be consumed by his enemies and in turn that makes him susceptible to self-sabotaging. He’s already started to do so with the latest posts he put on his Instagram Stories and feed — which have since been deleted — in which he took shots at everyone from Adidas to Christians. Someone must’ve told him to chill and enjoy his first No. 1 since 2011.
Carl Lamarre: He is enjoying a great run right now, and as a one-time super fan, despite his shenanigans, it’s interesting watching him try to bob and weave his way out of cancellation. Still, the odds of him returning to prime-time Mr. West, who was once doing blockbuster numbers in the mid-2000s, are slim because of the irreparable damage done.
Michael Saponara: Ye will always be part of the music mainstream scene no matter the circumstances. It definitely won’t be like the earlier portion of his career though. At this point, Ye has made it clear that he’s anti-industry, and he’s even teasing not putting his albums on streaming in the future, at least initially. Even with the backlash, he maintains the youth’s approval, but he’s just never going to operate like other music titans — and that’s what makes Ye, Ye.
Andrew Unterberger: He’s back, for sure, but he’s following as much as he’s leading now: “Carnival” has a little of that old Ye spark, but it also feels like he’s taking shortcuts to the prize rather than blazing his own path. That he can get there at all at age 46, more than two decades after his first No. 1, is certainly both impressive and meaningful. But will it inspire the same awe and reverence that his following was initially built on in the 2000s? Feels unlikely.",2024-03-12T19:32:01Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

Kim Kardashian and Bianca Censori put aside their differences to support Kanye West.
The ex-wife of the rapper was photographed enjoying with his present partner at the listening party for Kanye's new album, Vultures 1.
The Australian beauty, who allegedly tied the knot with the Runway singer in 2022, was seen standing next to the Skims founder in a now-viral video clip shared by record producer DJ Pharris.
Speaking of this unexpected union, body language expert Judi James told The Mirror that Kim and Bianca showed up like 'two fans' of the Yeezy founder at the event.
She said, ""The ex and current Ms West look relatively calm and un-troubled about sitting together to watch his show here, with their proximity suggesting a mutual desire to pitch themselves as friends.""
While analysing their expressions and postures, the expert claimed that the two ladies appeared to be not in a ""combative or even competitive state.""

Meanwhile Bianca was ever the supportive wife as she sang along to the music and filmed the performance on her phone. The women were also seen chatting with each other.
Fans were shocked at the sighting, with one writing on X (previously Twitter), “What on earth would they be [talking] about?” and another noting, “I don’t know but this is crazy.”
For the listening party, Bianca wore a revealing pink top although she opted to cover up her legs with gray leggings.
Though Kim and Bianca are apparently on good terms with each other, the Kardashians star has reportedly expressed her disdain for Bianca’s headline-making, bare-all dressing choices, especially in front of the kids.
“Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids. She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that,” an insider told the Daily Mail.",2024-03-12T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
"""Elementary School Dropout"": North West kündigt Album an","Sie tritt in die Fußstapfen ihres Vaters! North West (10) hatte schon vor einiger Zeit ausgeplaudert, dass sie davon träumt, Rapperin zu werden, genau wie ihr berühmter Papa Kanye West (46). Im Februar veröffentlichte sie zusammen mit Kanye und Ty Dolla Sign ihren ersten Song. Doch damit nicht genug: Auf einer Listening-Party ihres Vaters verkündete die Tochter von Kim Kardashian (43) laut Mirror, dass sie bald ihr erstes Album veröffentlichen wird: ""Hallo, ich bin es, Northie. Ich habe an einem Album gearbeitet. Es heißt 'Elementary School Drop Out'.""
Obwohl sie mit dem Titel des Albums, welches übersetzt so viel wie ""Grundschulabbrecher"" bedeutet, wohl auf Kanyes Debütalbum mit dem Namen ""The College Dropout"" anspielt, sind die Fans der Zehnjährigen besorgt, dass sie die Schule abbrechen könnte. ""Sie hat also die Grundschule abgebrochen?"", fragte ein Follower auf X, während ein anderer fassungslos schreibt: ""Sie verlässt die Grundschule."" Kanye selbst hatte zuvor den Wunsch öffentlich gemacht, seine Kinder von ihrer aktuellen Schule zu nehmen, da es ""die falsche Schule"" für seine Kinder sei.
Dass North ihrem Vater nacheifert, ist nichts Neues: Schon des Öfteren stand sie gemeinsam mit Kanye auf der Bühne. Und auch sonst scheint der Promi-Spross viel Zeit mit seinem Papa verbringen zu wollen: Kim offenbarte im vergangenen Jahr in ihrer Realityshow The Kardashians, dass North lieber bei ihrem Vater leben möchte. Immer, wenn sie Zeit mit ihm verbracht habe, sei sie davon überzeugt, dass er der Beste sei. ""Er hat alles im Griff. Er hat kein Kindermädchen, er hat keinen Koch, er hat keinen Sicherheitsdienst. Er lebt in einer Wohnung"", erklärt Kim und fügte hinzu, dass North sie dann immer weinend fragen würde, warum sie keine Wohnung habe.

Âgée de seulement 10 ans, North West, la fille de Kim Kardashian et de Kanye West, va prochainement sortir un tout premier album. Son titre ? Elementary School Dropout.
La fillette en a fait l’annonce dimanche dernier à Phoenix, en Arizona, alors que celui qui répond aussi au nom de Ye tenait une soirée d’écoute pour son prochain album, Vultures 2, rapporte différents médias américains, dont Forbes.
North West est montée sur scène aux côtés de son père et a déclaré qu’elle travaillait actuellement sur Elementary School Dropout. Sur une vidéo de l’évènement relayée sur le réseau social X, on entend la foule réagir avec enthousiasme à cette annonce.
Le titre de l’opus en préparation est vraisemblablement un clin d’œil au premier album studio de Kanye West, The College Dropout, lancé en 2004. Aucune date de sortie n’a toutefois été dévoilée.
D’ici là, on peut entendre la jeune fille sur la pièce Talking, paru sur le plus récent album de son père, Vultures 1, sorti il y a un mois.

"Ye & Ty Dolla $ign ""Vultures 2"": What We Know","Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign, also known as ¥$, recently began their first string of Vultures 2 album listening parties in cities such as Phoenix, Arizona, and San Francisco, California. During the listening events, fans discovered a few surprising things about the album-making process, along with what the final product might sound like. Ye had previously announced plans to drop Vultures 2 on March 8, but like many recent Kanye projects, this date came and went without an album on DSPs. Likewise, fans anticipate the upcoming Vultures 3 project to miss the projected release window of April 5, as the album likely hasn't even begun production yet.
Still, attendees of the March 10 listening party in Phoenix received the first glimpse into the Vultures sequel. With Ye & Ty Dolla $ign's upcoming Rolling Loud California performance on March 14th, we're breaking down what we know so far about Vultures 2.
Read More: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign ""Vultures 1"" Review
Ye And Ty Dolla $ign Are Still Performing ""Vultures 1""
Though many fans assumed the listening experience on March 10 would center around new material, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign spent the majority of the show showcasing the tracklist of the first Vultures album. This included multiple rousing performances of the hit song ""Carnival,"" with Ye and Ty each leaping into the crowd as the song blasted over the stadium speakers at the Footprint Center. Kanye donned a Jason Vorhees-style hockey mask for a majority of the show, though he did remove the face covering during performances of certain tracks, such as the Vultures 1 closer ""King.""
The performance featured songs originally intended for Vultures 1 that hadn't received clearance for streaming, including ""Good (Don't Die)"" and ""Everybody,"" which heavily relied on an uncleared sample from the Backstreet Boys. If the samples receive clearance for release, the duo could potentially include iterations of these tracks on Vultures 2. Additionally, the duo have continued to perform the original streaming versions of certain tracks like ""F*** Sumn,"" rather than the new-and-improved editions crafted by JPEGMAFIA, which the latter artist has played at recent solo shows.
Kanye Has Made His Music Career A True Family Affair
Unlike previous listening parties hosted by Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign in the past, the March 10 outing featured no famous rapper guests such as Freddie Gibbs, Playboi Carti, or Kodak Black. Instead, Ye and Ty were joined by three of Kanye's four children, North, Chicago, and Psalm. During the performance of ""Talking,"" North took center stage to perform her feature, as her younger siblings danced vibrantly close by. Between tracks, North West took to the microphone to announce plans to release an album of her own, titled Elementary School Dropout, a play on her father's debut album. While very little information is available about North's upcoming music at this time, the announcement was enough to send fans into a frenzy at the live event.

Vultures 2 Is Still Unfinished
Once the entirety of the Vultures 1 tracklist had been performed, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign each raised two fingers to signify the start of Vultures 2 at the first listening party. They then proceeded to play several never-before-heard songs. While these tracks undoubtedly left a lasting impact on attendees, it quickly became evident that the album is still unfinished, as the duo only unveiled a small handful of songs from the upcoming sequel. Additionally, most of the Vultures 2 songs shared at the show lacked completed Kanye vocals, signaling that the project is still heavily under construction.
Despite the unfinished nature of Vultures 2, there were plenty of elements from the new tracks that had fans glowing with excitement. The songs featured vocal passages from the likes of Future, Playboi Carti, 070 Shake, and Project Pat. Fans have estimated that the previewed Vultures 2 tracks will have titles such as ""Poppin',"" ""Promotion,"" ""Field Trip,"" and ""Slide"" based on the songs' lyrical content.
Vultures 2 May Not Receive A Wide Release
Hours before the March 10 listening experience, Kanye West expressed interest in releasing Vultures 2 as a purchase-only album available for $20 through his website. These comments came in response to James Blake's recent claim that streaming services exploit artists and devalue the artistic merit of music. The ""Father Stretch My Hands"" rapper made several social media posts deliberating on how to go about releasing Vultures 2, leaving some fans to fear they may never hear the finished project.
This mirrors Kanye's previous release of Donda 2, which he never officially completed and uploaded to streamers like Spotify or Apple Music. Instead, drafts of Donda 2 songs were available only to those who purchased the Stem Player. For now, there's no way of knowing if Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign will stick with this niche release method or not. As the duo continues touring their new tracks around the country, more information will surely be revealed to the public.",2024-03-12T14:11:10Z,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com,HotNewHipHop

Darum gehts North West gibt preis, dass sie bereits an ihrem ersten Album arbeitet.
Die Zehnjährige hat schon einen Titel für das Werk: «Elementary School Dropout».
Damit zollt sie ihrem Papi Kanye Tribut, der 2004 ein Album mit dem Titel «The College Dropout» veröffentlichte.
North West (10), die Tochter von Kanye West (46) und Kim Kardashian (43), hat ihr erstes Album angekündigt. Die Zehnjährige stahl damit sogar ihrem Papa die Show. Sie liess die Bombe nämlich am vergangenen Sonntag (10. März) auf der Listening-Party des neuen Albums ihres Vaters, «Vultures 2», platzen. Auf der Bühne in Phoenix teilte sie demnach mit dem Publikum die Neuigkeit, dass sie an einem Album arbeite.
Die Menge, bestehend aus Tausenden Kanye-Fans, war begeistert von der Ankündigung der Nachwuchsmusikerin und jubelte ihr zu, noch bevor der Satz zu Ende gesprochen war, wie «Forbes» berichtete.
Der Titel ihres Debütalbums stehe demnach auch schon – und ist eine Hommage an ihren erfolgreichen Vater: «Elementary School Dropout» soll es heissen und spielt auf Kanye Wests 2004 erschienenes Album «The College Dropout» an.
Es ist bei weitem nicht North Wests erster Schritt in die Musikwelt. Schon im Februar rappte sie einen kleinen Teil im Song «Talking/Once Again» von Kanye West und dem Rapper Ty Dolla $ign (41). Auch im dazugehörigen Musikvideo ist sie zu sehen – beim Haarestylen und mit Grills auf den Zähnen.
North Wests Karrierepläne: Basketball, Rap und Kunst
Der Weg zur grossen Rapkarriere ist also geebnet. Auch das Titelbild der Winterausgabe des Magazins «i-D» zierte North West zuletzt. Und erklärte im dazugehörigen Interview laut «People», wie sie sich ihre berufliche Zukunft vorstellt. Demnach wolle sie Rapperin und Basketballspielerin werden und Kunstwerke verkaufen.
Über das Startkapital für ihre Träume hatte sie sich auch schon Gedanken gemacht: «Wenn ich 13 bin, will ich mit Hunden Gassi gehen, um Geld zu verdienen, damit ich mir Kunstzubehör kaufen kann, weil hier alles so teuer ist», erläuterte sie dem Magazin ihren Plan. Zudem wolle sie die Unternehmen ihrer Eltern, die Bekleidungsfirma Skims und die Sneaker-Marke Yeezy, eines Tages übernehmen und Unternehmerin werden.
Kim Kardashian und der Musiker waren von 2014 bis 2022 verheiratet. Sie haben vier gemeinsame Kinder: Die Töchter North und Chicago (5) sowie die Söhne Saint (8) und Psalm (4).
Wirst du dir Norths Album anhören? Ja, das wird sicher super. Mal schauen. Nein, das ist nichts für mich.

健康網》「肯伊威斯特」上唇長痔瘡？醫解析,"美國饒舌歌手肯伊威斯特曾欲挑戰美國總統大位未果，仍在IG預告要再試一次。（圖擷自肯伊威斯特IG）
葉立斌／核稿編輯
〔健康頻道／綜合報導〕美國饒舌天王「肯爺」肯伊威斯特（Kanye West，現藝名為YE）在美國饒舌圈佔有一席之地，更自創時尚品牌；然他屢因不妥當的言行登上媒體版面，飽受抨擊。近期在國外熱烈被討論，並非歌曲、時尚品牌動態或是驚世駭俗行為，而是「嘴唇長痔瘡」？國外社群媒體上，有網友分享肯爺上唇有突起物，直接問「這是痔瘡嗎」，引發網友熱烈討論。台北台安醫院大腸直腸外科醫師黃郁純解析，這可能是唇疱疹或是肉芽腫膿包，總之「不是痔瘡」。
黃郁純在粉專「痔零姊姊 黃郁純醫師 良好生活 I 大腸直腸肛門外科女醫 痔瘡手術」說明，近期國外網友討論肯伊威斯特嘴唇上的突起物，不是國外網友第一個想到的痔瘡，可能為「唇皰疹」或者「肉芽腫」。
請繼續往下閱讀...
痔瘡體積大 僅長在肛門口周圍
黃郁純說明，痔瘡只會長在肛門口周圍，痔瘡的發病原因很簡單，就是腹內壓過高引起肛門口的血管結構向下滑動或靜脈壓過度升高所致，可能引起的來源為：不規則的排便習慣（便秘或腹瀉）、缺乏運動、營養因素（低纖維飲食導致排便困難）、腹內壓升高（長時間用力、腹水、腹內壓升高、懷孕）、有部分為遺傳及老化。「所以痔瘡不會長在嘴唇上，肛門口的膿包卻不一定會是痔瘡喔。」
皰疹可能出現在臉上 抵抗力差才會發作
黃郁純說明，可分為單純皰疹病毒 （HSV）感染、帶狀皰疹、汗皰疹三種，其中最常見的感染便是單純皰疹病毒，會引起疼痛的水泡或潰瘍，它主要透過皮膚接觸傳播，它是可以治療的，但無法治癒，因為成因是病毒，當人體抵抗力強的時候，其實病毒會進入休眠期/潛伏期，它也會長在眼睛、生殖器、臀部、外陰部附近。
那有人就會說，那這樣肛門口附近的如何分辨是痔瘡還是皰疹，有個很簡單的判別方式就在於，痔瘡會先有異物感，然後夠成熟才會腫痛而且會愈來愈大，但是肛門口的皰疹（肛部皰疹感染）則是刺痛且長出來的是很多顆紅疹或小水泡，外觀與痔瘡差異很大。「痔瘡的體積較大，但是皰疹是你不用動就會刺痛。」
肉芽腫／血管瘤外觀像痘痘 皮膚傷口異常增生疾病
黃郁純說明，肉芽腫是原本發病位置就有傷口，皮膚在受傷之後會長血管幫助癒合，但有時候失控，長了太多血管變成一個紅色的突起物，屬於皮膚傷口上的異常增生疾病，多在直徑1cm以內。
另一種血管瘤則是皮膚、黏膜微血管內膜的血管內壁細胞異常增生，外觀長得像微亮的紅色突出物，長得也很像痘痘，是一種良性的腫瘤，擠破會流血且疼痛。且不會長在肛門。
最後黃郁純統整，痔瘡只會長在肛門口、不會傳染、排便時會痛且有異物感，而且治療方式也跟皰疹不同，主要透過消炎、止痛、軟便劑來改善腫脹與減少腹內壓過高，其病徵體積也較皰疹、肉芽腫、血管瘤來得大多。「所以真的不要什麼藥膏都擦在嘴唇上喔，因為可能會更嚴重。」

North West to Release Debut Album Elementary School Dropout,"Watch : Kim Kardashian Celebrates North West's Music Milestone
North West is getting into the family business.
The 10-year-old daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West announced that she is getting ready to release her own music.
""I've been working on an album,"" she told the cheering crowd at a March 10 release listening party for Kanye's album Vultures 2 in Phoenix, Arizona, according to Forbes. ""And it's called Elementary School Dropout.""
She's even turning to her dad for inspiration as the title of her upcoming album is a reference to Kanye's own debut studio album, 2004's The College Dropout.
E! News has reached out Kim and Kanye for comment, but has not heard back yet.
And while this will be North's first record, it's hardly her first venture into the musical world. In fact, she recently reached a music milestone with an entry on the Billboard Hot 100 list for her collaboration on her dad Kanye's Vultures track, ""Talking,"" making her one of the youngest to chart on Billboard.",2024-03-11T18:56:00Z,https://www.eonline.com,E!

"Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign's ""CARNIVAL"" Slides Into The No. 1 Slot On Billboard Hot 100","Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign have been pretty nonchalant around the success surrounding VULTURES 1. It went number one on the Billboard Hot 200, albeit for only one week. However, it was still very impressive, especially since one of the pillars of streaming, Apple Music, did not go out of their way to really promote the album. Outside of James Blake's recent comments, it be another reason why Ye is leaning towards dropping VULTURES 2 on his website for $20. Now, Kanye West and his partner Ty can casually celebrate once more after Billboard announced that ""CARNIVAL"" will be going number one.
The wild and chaotic rager featuring Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti has been steadily making its way up the charts. In fact, it already hit the top spot on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 after jumping four placements. ""CARNIVAL"" will officially hold down number one when the list updates tomorrow, March 12. Furthermore, the explosive collaboration will take over Beyonce's country hit ""TEXAS HOLD 'EM,"" which had its reign for just seven days.

Additionally, this is a big accomplishment for everyone involved, especially Kanye West. This is his first song to reach the mountain top since his contributions to the alien-like Katy Perry track ""E.T."" from 2011. Also worth noting is the fact that Ye is now the only rapper in history to have a number one record in three decades (2000s, 2010s, and 2020s). Of course, Ty Dolla $ign, Playboi Carti, and Rich The Kid, have plenty to be proud of. For the L.A. artist, this is his second with his first being on Post Malone's ""Psycho."" For the featured guests, this is both their first time being this high on the Hot 100 chart.
What are your thoughts on Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, Rich The Kid, and Playboi Carti going number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with ""CARNIVAL?"" Is this song good enough to reach this spot, why or why not? Who had the best performance on the track? Is it still in your rotation?

Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign’s ‘Carnival’ Hits No. 1 on Hot 100,"Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and Ty Dolla $ign’s “Carnival,” featuring Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti, rises to No. 1, from No. 2, on the Billboard Hot 100. The song marks Ye’s fifth leader and Ty Dolla $ign’s second, as well as the first each for Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti.
Meanwhile, Ye extends his span of career Hot 100 No. 1s to over 20 years, becoming the first rap artist to achieve the feat.
Ye is also the first rapper ever to have topped the Hot 100 in three distinct decades (the 2000s, ‘10s and ‘20s).
The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated March 16, 2024) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, March 12. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.
“Carnival,” which becomes the 1,165th No. 1 in the Hot 100’s 65-year history, drew 33.7 million streams (up 4%) and 3.9 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 85%) and sold 3,000 downloads (up 15%) in the March 1-7 tracking week, according to Luminate.
The single adds a third week atop the Streaming Songs chart and jumps 19-13 for a new high on Digital Song Sales.
The track was released Feb. 10 on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign’s collaborative album Vultures 1, on the former’s YZY label. The set, Ye’s first following a string of hate speech and antisemitic remarks, debuted at No. 1 on the Feb. 24-dated Billboard 200 chart and led for two weeks; it holds at No. 3 in its fourth week on the list.
Here’s a deeper look at the song’s ascent to the Hot 100’s summit.",2024-03-11T17:42:02Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Kanye West Yeezy Shirt Hilariously Roasted For Fitting Like A Pillow Case,"Kanye West has put out a lot of clothes under the Yeezy umbrella. Although he used to work in collaboration with Adidas, he is now on his own. Overall, this has led to some interesting pieces. Throughout the rollout for Vultures, Ye has been dropping a ton of new garments. These pieces are typically a mix of streetwear fashion and album merch. Fans have been quick to scoop these options up as they know stock levels can diminish on the Yeezy website, extremely fast. Unfortunately, not every review of these new offerings has been positive.
Case in point, a man recently bought the Vultures 1 shirt that is going for $20 on the Yeezy website. Below, you can see that he had a pretty bad experience with how the shirt actually fits. Out of the package, the man notes that the shirt is fairly boxy, and looks like a pillow case. Subsequently, he went to go put on the garment, and he quickly realized just how poorly it actually fits him. It was a brutal experience, and the man couldn't help but laugh at the entire situation.

Kanye West Gets A Negative Review
Kanye West has always been experimental when it comes to clothes. Overall, he tries to do things differently, and sometimes, that doesn't end up working out. However, the experimentation has positioned Yeezy nicely as a brand that could push boundaries. Hopefully, Ye will take the critique in stride, and fix the clothes accordingly. Otherwise, he will continue to receive these kinds of negative reviews. Only time will tell what other pieces Ye ends up offering his supporters.
Let us know what you think of this review, in the comments section below. Were you planning on copping Yeezy merch? Does this review affect your decision at all?

Kanye West’s ‘Carnival’ Tops Hot 100 Despite Controversial Rollout,"Topline
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s song “Carnival,” from their collaborative album “Vultures 1,” topped the Billboard Hot 100 this week, giving West his first No. 1 hit in the United States in more than a decade—despite the antisemitism controversies that threatened his career and the album’s rocky rollout.

Key Facts
West and Ty Dolla $ign’s “Carnival” displaces Beyoncé’s country hit, “Texas Hold ‘Em,” at the top of this week’s Billboard Hot 100 chart. West’s last No. 1 hit was in 2011 as a featured artist on Katy Perry’s “E.T.,” while his last solo chart-topper was “Stronger” in 2007. “Carnival” rose to No. 1 in its fourth week after hovering in the top five thanks to gains across all metrics measured by Billboard: streaming figures, radio airplay and digital downloads. The song was streamed more than 33 million times in the past week, a 4% increase from the week prior, while its 3.9 million radio airplay impressions nearly doubled its total from the week prior, Billboard reported. “Vultures 1” also spends this week at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 album chart after ranking No. 1 for its first two weeks on the chart.
Key Background
West has achieved chart success with “Carnival” and “Vultures 1” despite the antisemitism controversies that threatened to derail his career. In 2022, West—then estimated to be worth $2 billion by Forbes—was dropped from his Adidas partnership after making a series of bizarre statements widely condemned as antisemitic, including a tweet that he would go “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE.” After losing his Adidas deal, West’s net worth crumbled to an estimated $400 million.
Tangent
West’s album rollout for “Vultures 1” has also been marred by several other controversies. Ozzy Osbourne said in an X post last month he denied West permission to sample his 1983 live performance of “Iron Man” on “Carnival,” calling West an antisemite, and he reportedly threatened legal action. The song was reportedly released without the sample. Donna Summer’s estate reportedly filed a lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles alleging West sampled her 1977 song, “I Feel Love,” after being denied permission. West’s song, “Good (Don’t Die),” has been unavailable on Spotify since last month over the Summer sample dispute. “Vultures 1” was also briefly pulled from Apple Music and iTunes last month after distributor FUGA said it was working to remove the album from streaming services. The distributor said it had declined to release “Vultures 1,” but claimed it was instead released through the platform’s automatic processes by a longstanding FUGA client, “violating our service agreement.” The album still debuted atop the Billboard 200 despite being unavailable on streaming for part of the tracking week.
What To Watch For
When West’s “Vultures 1” follow-up, “Vultures 2,” will drop. The album was slated to release Friday, Billboard reported, but it has yet to arrive. A West fan account, Ye Fanatics, posted screenshots of direct messages they say West sent them this week, claiming West told them he may not release “Vultures 2” on streaming services because streaming “devalues music.” Instead, he said he may release the album solely for purchase on his website.

North West ‘working’ to debut first album ‘Elementary School Dropout’,"File Footage
North West seems to be following in her father Kanye West’s footsteps.
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s 10-year-old daughter North announced the release of her own music album.
""I've been working on an album,"" she revealed to the excited audience at a March 10 release listening party for Kanye's album Vultures 2 in Phoeniz, Arizona, as per Forbes. ""And it's called Elementary School Dropout.""
She took her dad Kanye's debut studio album, 2004's The College Dropout as an inspiration for her album’s title.
Even though this will be North's debut album, it's not her first walk into the music industry.
She even became the youngest person to chart on Billboard when her contribution on her father Kanye's Vultures song, ""Talking,"" made her an entry on the Billboard Hot 100 list, marking a significant milestone in the music industry.
But North has a bigger plan than being just a musician, as she's previously expressed her intentions of taking over for both her mom's SKIMS brand and her dad's Yeezy label.
""I'm going to do art on the side,"" she told i-D in a November profile. ""When I'm, like, 13, I want to walk dogs, to make money to buy art supplies, because everything around here is so expensive. So a rapper, a basketball player, and I'm going to make artwork that I sell.""",2024-03-10T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign's ""CARNIVAL"" Expected To Go No. 1 This Week","The biggest track off of Ye and Ty Dolla $ign's VULTURES 1 is still building up a lot of momentum. Moreover, according to Talk of the Charts, ""CARNIVAL,"" also featuring Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti, is expected to go No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 this week a little less than a month after its initial release. While it hasn't been able to crack that top spot so far, the song still has a lot of social media pushing behind it and has been ranking high on pretty much every applicable commercial metric. These are all just predictions that aren't coming straight from Billboard, but with that grain of salt in mind, it would be a pretty interesting cinch for the duo.
For example, if ""CARNIVAL"" goes number one, then Ye would become the first hip-hop artist to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart in three separate decades. His last No. 1 was 2011's ""E.T."" with Katy Perry, and ""CARNIVAL"" would be his fifth chart-topper alongside ""Gold Digger,"" ""Slow Jamz,"" and ""Stronger."" As for Ty, it would be his second No. 1, and it would be Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti's first. All this is pretty promising ahead of the prompt release of VULTURES 2 sometime... soon... ish.

""CARNIVAL"" Might Go No. 1 Ahead Of VULTURES 2's Release
What's more is that, for folks who liked King Vamp on ""CARNIVAL,"" it looks like there will be plenty more where that came from. Playboi Carti appears on various tracks that Ye and Ty Dolla Sign featured during their recent VULTURES 2 listening party, so it looks like they're working with a lot of the same collaborators as the first installment. While this might disappoint some fans, these albums are part of a series. As such, it's no surprise that they feel connected like this, albeit like retreads. But we can't say for sure until the rest of them actually drop.
Meanwhile, given that Rich The Kid hopped on a car to sing this song with fans at the Italy listening event, it's clear that this song really resonated with the artists and with the fans in every sense of the word. Do you think that it will cinch a No. 1? Drop your thoughts down in the comments section below. Also, stay up to date on HNHH for the latest news and updates on all things Vultures.

The wife of Kanye West showed off her assets in Los Angeles Friday night by leaving almost nothing to the imagination with a sheer thong bodysuit that had her cheeks fully on display.
She wore the revealing outfit — which also showed off her perky chest — to an album listening party for West’s upcoming “Vultures 2.”

The 29-year-old architectural designer continued her no-pants trend by pairing the bodysuit with nothing but black tights that featured proactive garter-style cutouts. She completed the outfit with black pumps and had her short brunette hair slicked back.
West, 46, wore a much more conservative outfit that included a gray Yeezy hoodie ($20) worn under his go-to leather Balenciaga coat. He opted for black pants and boots on the bottom.
Censori’s decision to wear risqué attire again comes less than a week after she was seen in Paris wearing a much more demure ensemble that covered her décolletage and legs.

Her father, Leo Censori, reportedly “wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony.”
“He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands,” the insider added last week, per the Daily Mail.
For more Page Six Style …
Bianca’s friends have reportedly already tried talking to her about the decisions she makes with West, but they claim their pleas have fallen on deaf ears.
The Australian model seems very comfortable in her skin when wearing revealing clothes, though.

Just last week, she turned heads by stepping out in Paris wearing a sheer tank top and matching tights with no undergarments underneath, meaning all of her curves were uncovered.
Bianca also went commando for Paris Fashion Week with sheer tights on her bottom half. However, she decided to cover up her chest with a cropped fur jacket.

Bianca, 29, has become known for her risque outfits consisting of garments that leave much of her body exposed.
For her most recent look, the former Yeezy architectural designer wore an outfit consisting of a bodysuit that featured cut-outs on her upper thighs.
While the long-sleeved suit was all black, Bianca's breasts were exposed as she opted to go braless underneath the sheer ensemble.
The thong design of the bottom allowed the model to show her entire butt, a move Bianca has also been pulling lately.
Kanye, 46, walked alongside Bianca while debuting his new Yeezyy hoodie, which he paired with a black leather jacket and matching pants.
Bianca, who tied the knot with the Heartless rapper in December 2022, caused a massive stir with her outfits while recently spending time in Paris, France.
In mid-February, Bianca was photographed wearing see-through tights without underwear.
The outfit caused a massive stir, as she completely exposed her genitals and backside for a day of shopping with her husband.

The no-pants look was one that could've gotten her in trouble with French officials, as it defied the city's laws of exhibitionism.
The celeb's act of ""sexual display"" in a public area could've cost her a fine $16,256 or one year in prison, according to Article 222-32 of the new penal code.

Two days after being seen in the risque look, Bianca ditched her underwear once again while wearing another sheer outfit in public.
She was pictured at a Paris restaurant putting on an affectionate display with the controversial rapper while rocking a risque black dress and stockings.
Bianca exposed her butt and genitals in the tiny dress, which she was seen using her cell phone in an attempt to cover up.
She also opted to go braless in the plunging top, revealing her nipples during the outing once more.
KIM'S THOUGHTS
One person who has slammed Bianca's revealing looks is Kanye's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, 43.
Last month, a source claimed that Kim demanded that Bianca cover up around her and Kanye's four children.
""Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids,"" the source said to the Daily Mail.
""She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.""
The demands came soon after Kim's eldest child North West, 10, doodled a naked drawing of her stepmother.
Kim shared a photo of her daughter's notebook, in which North had written several things she was grateful for that day.
North listed several things about her father's album, Vultures I, along with a sketch of Bianca wearing just a tiny thong on the album cover.
Despite wanting Bianca to be more modest around her children, Kim seemingly embodied her signature style during a recent outing.
The Hulu star was seen wearing a completely sheer look composed of shiny see-through tights as she left the Ritz Paris Hotel during Paris Fashion Week.
However, Kim opted to cover up most of her body with a Balenciaga overcoat, hiding much of her ensemble.

Kanye West Teases 'Vultures 2' With Ty Dolla Sign After Album Delay,"Kanye West is sharing some new artwork for his upcoming Vultures 2 album with Ty Dolla $ign.
The rapper and fashion mogul, who now goes by Ye, took to social media early Saturday (March 9) to share a photo of himself wearing all black and holding a portrait of what appears to be Ty’s incarcerated Brother Big TC.
“VULTURES 2,” Ye captioned the Instagram post, which features an image of the superstar rapper wearing a face mask and leather jacket.
The sequel album was expected to arrive on Friday (March 8), about one month after Vultures 1, which topped the Billboard 200 chart in back-to-back weeks. That marked the first time West held the top spot for more than a week since Watch The Throne.
Trending on Billboard
The impending arrival of Vultures 2 sets up another busy month for Ye and Ty Dolla $ign. They’re set to host a pair of Vultures listening experience parties at Phoenix’s Footprint Center (March 10) and San Francisco’s Chase Center (March 12) before making their live performance debut on Thursday (March 14) at Rolling Loud California.
The project boasts Vultures leftovers such as “Everybody” and “Time Moving Slow.” Ye and Ty invite a plethora of guests into the mix to execute their vision with appearances from Playboi Carti, Young Thug, Travis Scott, Lil Baby and more.
On Friday night, West and his wife, Bianca Censori, arrived to a Vultures 2 listening party in Los Angeles, according to TMZ. Ye reportedly gave an update on the sequel’s progress through the fan Instagram account Ye Fanatics, writing, “We in the Lab.”

"Kanye West & Bianca Censori Show ""Vultures"" Listening Party Some Lewd PDA","While Vultures 2 is nowhere in sight, at least fans who caught their private listening party last night (Friday, March 8) caught some cool moments. Of course, the main thing that people wanted to hear was the music, and Ye and Ty Dolla $ign previewed a lot of tracks from their collab series' second installment. Some were previously played tracks like ""RIVER"" that really caught fans' ears during the past listening parties across the U.S. and Europe. Others were brand-new or even older leaks that will apparently be part of this new album cycle. However, one of the most notable things to actually happen during the event was seeing the Chicago artist and his wife Bianca Censori just have fun together.
Moreover, the two laughed and smiled at each other as Ye played one of their tracks, seemingly also featuring Future. At one point, he pulled her body closer to his in a pretty suggestive way, and it seems like they had a great time overall. This listening party was certainly a very different experience to that of previous iterations, as it felt more like a traditional DJ set than a pseudo-performance on a stage. For those who have only seen Bianca Censori and her husband through wild fit pics and paparazzi antics, it's nice to just see them live in the moment.

Bianca Censori Joins Ye At Vultures Listening Event: Watch
Meanwhile, with Ye recently posting the VULTURES 2 album cover itself, which is apparently of either him or Ty Dolla Sign holding a picture of his incarcerated brother who was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he says he didn't commit, some fans hope that they'll be quick to drop part two. But we all know it's never been that simple. Still, there are a lot more listening parties to come in the next few days. We're sure that Bianca Censori will be there to support all of them.
But do you think that VULTURES 2 actually drops this weekend or are we getting it a weekend or two down the road... or not at all? What about the alleged tension when it comes to Bianca's family's view of the relationship? Whatever the case, drop your thoughts on any and all of this down in the comments section below. Also, come back to HNHH for the latest updates on VULTURES 2, its creators, and Bianca Censori.

Bianca Censori sauer: Kanye West ist eifersüchtig auf Ex Kim,"Kim Kardashian (43) soll eine neue Beziehung mit dem NFL-Spieler Odell Beckham Jr. (31) eingegangen sein. Doch einem stößt das wohl richtig sauer auf: Ihr Ex-Mann Kanye West (46) soll mit der neuen Liebe gar nicht einverstanden sein. ""Kanye ist unberechenbar und hat eine Vergangenheit, in der er in der Öffentlichkeit ausgerastet ist, besonders wenn es um Kim geht. Es ist möglich, dass er immer noch eine Art Groll gegen sie hegt oder sogar eifersüchtig ist, weil sie weiterzieht"", erklärt die Beziehungsexpertin Louella Alderson gegenüber The Mirror. Dabei ist Kanye eigentlich selbst wieder glücklich verheiratet. Für seine Frau Bianca Censori (29) soll seine Eifersucht ein ""rotes Tuch"" sein. Auf seine Wutausbrüche könne die Designerin sicher gut verzichten, vermutet Louella.
Sollte Kanye tatsächlich von seiner Eifersucht übermannt werden und einen öffentlichen Aussetzer haben, wird sich das vermutlich nicht nur gegen Kim, sondern auch gegen ihren neuen Partner richten. ""In diesem Fall könnte er negative Kommentare über Odell oder ihre Beziehung abgeben. Wenn das passiert, wäre das ein Warnsignal für seine eigene Beziehung mit Bianca, da es zeigen würde, dass er noch nicht ganz über Kim hinweg ist"", erklärt die Expertin weiter. Einen solchen Fauxpas leistete sich der Rapper schon, als Kim mit dem Komiker Pete Davidson (30) zusammen war: Er schikanierte Pete mehrfach im Netz, sodass dieser sogar eine Traumatherapie machen musste.
Bianca wurde 2022 im Rahmen einer privaten Blitzheirat Kanyes Frau. Für ihre Familie ist der Musiker ein rotes Tuch. Seitdem die beiden vor den Altar getreten sind, änderte sich der Kleidungsstil der Australierin radikal: Meist zeigt sie mehr Haut als Stoff. Ihr Vater Leo soll sich deswegen große Sorgen machen. Wie ein Insider gegenüber Daily Mail behauptete, habe er Angst, sein Schwiegersohn isoliere seine Tochter von der Familie. In der Öffentlichkeit präsentiere er sie wie eine ""billige nackte Trophäe"".

"JPEGMAFIA Plays Alternate Version Of Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign's ""FUK SUMN,"" Crowd Goes Ballistic","JPEGMAFIA recently performed at the Pitchfork Music Festival CDMX in México on Wednesday (March 6), and played an alternate version of the VULTURES 1 cut ""FUK SUMN"" that made fans in the crowd go ballistic. Moreover, it's one of a few tracks that he helped produce for Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's collab album, along with the opener ""STARS,"" the dramatic and choral-inspired ""BEG FORGIVENESS,"" and the closer ""KING."" This version is a bit darker and features Quavo on it, some ethereal high-pitched synths, and a slightly different structure and percussion mix. It's a pretty solid and subtle reimagining, especially considering that we can only hear it through a live recording of it.
Furthermore, a lot of fans are wondering whether JPEGMAFIA will also help this duo out for the next installments of Vultures. However, at least at press time on VULTURES 2's previously scheduled release date, it doesn't seem like this will manifest just yet. It's March 8, and the album still isn't out, although this is exactly what happened with the first installment of this supposed trilogy. Regardless, with some listening parties on the cards, we can't imagine that this is an easy end to this tale.

JPEGMAFIA's Live Version Of ""FUK SUMN"": Watch
Meanwhile, this is also pretty notable because it's one of the first instances of Peggy acknowledging VULTURES 1 in a while. Last time, it was because of his smoke-searching with Freddie Gibbs, with whom he has a big problem and wanted to engage in beef with. While the Indiana MC responded to JPEGMAFIA in quite the unbothered and mocking way, this was still a really bizarre and unfortunate feud to witness. Maybe we're projecting here, but their fanbase crossover is much larger than many other rap opponents out there.
Also, this continues the Baltimore creative's staunch support of Ye, his idol, despite his far-right and antisemitic behavior. As someone who is very left-leaning in his music and interviews -– and literally made fun of not just Kanye despite his love of him, but also the black metal group whose designs the Chicago artist took inspiration from for this album rollout -– this disappointed a lot of die-hards. We'll see how that develops over time. For more news and the latest updates on JPEGMAFIA and Vultures, log back into HNHH.

"Kanye West Delivers Update On ""Vultures 2"" As Fans Rip Him Apart For Yet Another Late Album","Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign promised fans three distinct versions of Vultures. The first version came out last month, and overall, it was well-received by Ye's biggest fans. However, from a critical standpoint, it got a ton of mixed reviews. Some found it to be focused and persistent, while others believed to be an undercooked mix. Well, on Friday, Ye was supposed to deliver Vultures 2. Throughout the week, there were very few updates on the album, and fans predicted that he would not release it.
On Friday, those predictions ultimately came true. At midnight, fans rushed to Spotify and Apple Music to see if the album had made its way to streaming services. Of course, it hadn't. This led to a ton of reactions on social media, with many lamenting their own stupidity for trusting Ye with dropping an album on time. However, according to NFR Podcast, Ye is aware of the disappointment. In fact, he tried to soften the blow by saying he and and Ty Dolla Sign are currently ""in the lab.""

This means the album is in the midst of being worked on. However, it remains to be seen what that means for the actual release date. It could come out next week in time for his Rolling Loud performance. Or, it could very well take another few weeks to a month. At this point, no one really knows. Ye changes his mind on a dime, and that is something that has remained consistent throughout his entire career. With Vultures 3 slotted for an April 5th release, you can expect a delay to that project, as well.

Man Claims Kanya West Slid Into His Girlfriend’s DM,"Kanye West has been quite synonymous with controversy for years now. Despite his considerable contribution to the world of music, Kanye’s reputation seems to have been buoyed by an array of popular scandals that continue to make headlines every time. A similar thing has happened recently as the Vultures rapper faces cheating allegations against his wife after shocking claims by a social media influencer. This began a few days after Bryce Hall, a popular internet personality and boxer, shared explosive screenshots of Kanye West reaching out to his girlfriend on Instagram.
In a video shared on his social media handle, Bryce posted screenshots of the chat, which show the 46-year-old rapper asking his girlfriend Mikaela to hang out with him and listen to his music. The chat begins with West dropping the first text that reads, “Back in Cali,” to which Mikaela replies, “What?”
Next, the rapper questions whether Mikaela is in California or the US and continues, “Wanted to see if you wanted to hang and listen to the new album.” With the video, Byrce also added a caption that reads. “What do I do here?”

Later, the social media influencer also shared the screenshot on X (Formerly Twitter), suggesting that West deleted the texts after he was turned down by Mikaela. As he began by joking and said, “Kanye is sliding on my girlfriend. Someone tell Kim,” it was followed by another hilarious tweet, “cmon ye… at least invite me to the hang and listen session.”

Notably, as soon as the shocking screenshots came out, fans wasted no time in targeting the rapper. Many called him out for cheating on his wife, Bianca Censori. Some were even convinced that the rapper had old ties with the influencer’s girlfriend.

The allegations come in the wake of the intense backlash that Kanye has been facing in the last few days. According to reports, the rapper has set a couple of rules for his wife, including specific foods that she can eat and “never speak.”
“Kanye has a set of rules for Bianca, which includes never speaking and wearing what he wants her to wear. She is also required to eat certain food items and to work out, even though Kanye doesn’t work out.

Kim Kardashian has been warned of Kanye West's 'unpredictable' moves amid her new romance with Odell Beckham Jr.
For the unversed, the Skims founder is reportedly in a romantic relationship with the basketball player.
However, there is a history that the reality TV star's ex-husband often makes negative comments about Kim's love life despite being married to Bianca Censori.
In a conversation with The Mirror, relationship expert Louella Alderson believes Kanye ""may still hold some form of resentment or even jealousy towards Kim moving on.""
She said, ""In this case, he may potentially make negative comments about Odell or their relationship.""
Louella shared, ""If so, this would be a red flag for his own relationship with Bianca, as it could show he is not fully over Kim and still holds onto strong emotions towards her, even if it's in a negative way.""
The expert also claimed that the Vultures maker could use Kim's new relationship ""as a way to create more publicity for himself and his new album, as he has done in the past with other public feuds.""",2024-03-07T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

"Donda Academy, Founded by Kanye West, Faces Transformations Amid Legal Battle With Former Teachers","Amid ongoing legal battles and allegations of misconduct, Kanye West’s Donda Academy, a Christian private school funded by the rapper, has recently undergone prominent changes and rebranding. The institution, initially named Donda Academy, has now been revamped as Donda Ray Academy, paying tribute to West’s mother and father. This transformation comes as the academy relocates to a new site in Chatsworth, located in California’s San Fernando Valley. The revamped Donda Ray Academy had launched numerous modifications, including a renewed focus on basketball, choir, and dance programs. Additionally, the academy has hired top choreographers to elevate the teaching experience for its students. Vocal training is also being offered, as showcased in recent social media posts shared by the academy on its newly created Instagram account.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ye (@ye)
As per the reports of Radar, despite the legal turmoil surrounding the academy, West remains dedicated to providing quality education to the students. An insider revealed that West was determined to persevere and not give up on the children, highlighting his dedication to their betterment and educational development. However, the academy has been tangled in controversy following lawsuits filed by former teachers, Cecilia Hailey and Chekarey Byers. Allegations against the academy include health, safety, and educational violations, such as lack of bullying prevention measures, absence of janitorial and medical services, and failure to comply with nutrition guidelines. Hailey and Byers claimed that the academy’s regulations jeopardized the welfare of the students, citing instances of unsanitary conditions, inadequate nutrition, and discriminatory practices. They also blamed the academy for their termination as a retaliatory step against their complaints regarding the institution’s unlawful and unsafe practices.

In response to the legal battles, West and Donda Academy have ferociously denied any wrongdoing. They have refuted the accusations and have sought dismissal of the lawsuits, claiming that West had no indulgence in the operations of the academy. As per the complaint, “In one incident, a student assaulted an eighth-grade student by slapping her, then attempted to assault another teacher. The student had multiple accounts of bullying, both physically and verbally, that had gone without discipline.” as reported by Daily Mail.

The plaintiffs' attorney, Ron Zambrano shared, “Clearly, Ye has a big problem on his hands with this school, and the addition of Ms. Meeks to the complaint only serves to reinforce the nightmarish conditions for staff and students at Donda Academy. Ms. Meeks was fired months before Cecilia Hailey and Chekarey Byers were terminated but all three clearly witnessed the same illegal and disturbing code violations and conduct at the school, and all three were given the same retaliatory and unlawful treatment merely for trying to stand up for the students’ rights to a meaningful education. Donda and Ye now have an established pattern of retaliation, from two independent sources, to contend with.” As the legal battles unfold, the allegations against Donda Academy underscore the complexities and challenges facing the institution.",2024-03-07T10:30:45Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Kim Kardashian dénudée, les internautes l'accusent de ""copier"" Bianca Censori","Crédit photo : Tom Nicholson/Shutterstock
Kim Kardashian a fait grimper la température d’un cran. Ce mercredi 6 mars, la star américaine a publié une série de clichés sur Instagram en tenue full Balenciaga. L’ex-femme de Kanye West a alors laissé apparaître un large décolleté, au travers d’un long manteau de fourrure imprimé léopard. Le hic ? Les internautes n’ont pas vu cette publication d’un bon oeil puisqu’ils l’accusent de copier Bianca Censori, l’actuelle femme du rappeur. On t’explique pourquoi !
Kim Kardashian et Bianca Censori, même combat ?
Depuis quelques mois, Bianca Censori fait beaucoup jaser sur la toile. La raison ? Ses looks tous plus extravagants les uns que les autres, voire osés et vulgaires, comme le déplorent certains internautes. Récemment, c’est dans les rues de Paris que la femme de Kanye West s’est baladée totalement nue, vêtue d’un simple collant transparent lors de la Fashion Week. De quoi faire polémique. Et alors que Kim Kardashian aurait, selon les informations du Mirror UK, demandé implicitement à Bianca Censori de « se couvrir » devant ses enfants pour ne pas les choquer, elle a elle aussi fait chou blanc ce mercredi 6 mars en se montrant dans un look plutôt olé-olé sur Instagram. De quoi susciter de vives réactions chez les internautes, qui n’y sont pas allé de main morte avec la star du clan Kardashian-Jenner.
Les internautes se lâchent !
Bien que Kim Kardashian ait reçu une flopée de compliment sur ce look controversé, elle a aussi reçu un déferlement de critiques négatives. Certains la comparant à Bianca Censori, et l’accusant de « copier » la femme de Kanye West. Nous pouvons lire sous sa photo Instagram : « On dirait l’aspirante de Bianca Censori pour sa tenue iconique avec la fourrure ». Ou encore : « Maintenant elle a les seins à l’air comme Bianca », « Elle a des vibes de Bianca Censori ». Mais la ressemblance troublante avec les looks controversés de Bianca Censori n’est pas la seule raison pour laquelle Kim Kardashian s’est pris un tollé après la publication de ces clichés. De fait, son manteau de fourrure signé Balenciaga fait également polémique.

Kim Kardashian au coeur d’une polémique
Et si le look de Kim Kardashian est autant décrié, c’est parce que la star américaine continue visiblement de soutenir Balenciaga, même après le scandale autour du bondage survenu l’année précédente. Pour rappel, la marque avait été au coeur d’une vive polémique après avoir partagé une publicité d’enfants tenant des peluches avec des accessoires de bondage. Une publicité controversée qui a mis l’enseigne dans la tourmente. Et ce mercredi 6 mars, Kim Kardashian en a fait les frais, les internautes s’indignant de sa collaboration avec la marque. Ainsi, nous pouvons lire en commentaires : « Vous soutenez donc une entreprise qui traite de pédophilie ? », « Nous n’avons pas oublié, nous n’oublierons jamais ! ». Ou encore : « Elle n’en n’a rien à faire des enfants », « Sérieusement ?? Qui achète cette marque ? », « Vraiment déçu », « Pourquoi vous continuez à les soutenir ? ». Bad buzz en perspective pour Kim Kardashian…",2024-03-07T09:52:02Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty

The comparison comes into the picture with adultery rumors of West doing the rounds over the internet.

The 43-year-old was seen leaving the Ritz Hotel in Paris donning a skin-tight sheer bodysuit and an overcoat that trailed to the floor as she clutched it around her chest. The Kardashians star paired the look with black sunglasses and a sleek bun with nude makeup according to Mirror. The reality star and mother of four has stayed mum over the rumors about her ex-husband with whom she shares four kids.

The skin-tight suit stretched to Kardashian's heels that immediately caught the attention of netizens who compared the look to Censori's, an architect turned model. Censori's style quotient has time to time inspired explosive comments against her and the rapper for being explicitly racy in public places. The couple has constantly been trolled for their ill-fitted choice of attire which is generally nude or sheer. The Vultures rapper also faced backlash for posting his wife's risqué images on Instagram.

Responding to it, he took to Instagram and called out those trolling his freedom to post his wife online. Moving on to the rumors, it all began when the American social media personality and boxer, Bryce Hall tweeted a screenshot over X, formerly known as Twitter. The screenshot was from the inbox of his girlfriend, Mikaela Lafuente. Hall captioned the image, ""Kanye is sliding on my girlfriend.. someone tell Kim."" The screenshot carries a short conversation wherein Ye asks Lafuente, ""Back in Cali"" followed by a text that reads, ""Are you in California or the States,"" when she replies with a ""Yes, why?"" West then explained, ""Wanted to see if you wanted to hang and listen to the new album."" Reportedly, the co-parents' relationship deteriorated further after the tweet went viral.

Following their divorce in 2021, the duo prioritized co-parenting their four children. Recently, the rapper accused Kardashian of the discontinuation of a deal with Adidas. West posted on Instagram, stating, ""This is the document that they give employees at Adidas when asked questions about Yeezy. ""There is an overlap to Adidas and Kim ignoring my opinion on where my kids go to school or people ignoring my name change or the entire celebrity culture ostracizing me for my political opinion It all comes down to human rights which you sacrifice when you’re stigmatized with mental issues All these situations are actually far crazier than what I’ve been branded to be."" Lately, West has removed all the posts from his social media handle of Instagram and retained only one.

Celebrities Named in New Donald Trump Court Filing,"Several celebrities were mentioned in an amicus curiae brief filed in support of President Donald Trump's motion to dismiss the classified documents indictment against him.
Trump faces 40 felony counts in Florida that accuse him of willfully retaining dozens of classified documents after he left the White House and rebuffing government demands to give them back. He has denied wrongdoing, and his lawyers have asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to dismiss the case.
The amicus curiae brief was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on Tuesday on behalf of Edwin Meese, who served as President Ronald Reagan's attorney general, law professors Steven Calabresi and Gary Lawson and the conservative nonprofit Citizens United.
The brief argued that special counsel Jack Smith does not have the authority to prosecute the case.
""Smith is the classic 'emperor with no clothes.' He has no more authority to represent the United States in this Court than Tom Brady, Lionel Messi, or Kanye West,"" the brief's conclusion says.
""The Court should grant the Motion to Dismiss on the Appointments Clause issue, and do so prior to ruling on the other Motions to Dismiss pending in this case.""
An earlier version of the brief, reviewed by Newsweek, had listed Kim Kardashian, Patrick Mahomes and Mick Jagger in the conclusion.
Newsweek reached out to the attorneys who filed the brief and a Trump spokesperson for comment via email. The special counsel's office declined to comment.
The brief argues that Smith's appointment as special counsel violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and is a ""potential fatal flaw"" in the prosecution.
""The way to appoint a Special Counsel consistent with the Appointments Clause is to follow the normal practice of the past quarter-century, conferring that status upon a person already serving as a U.S. Attorney, which adds a new matter to the portfolio of a Senate-confirmed principal officer,"" it says.
""But the Attorney General cannot appoint a private citizen or government employee, who was never confirmed by the Senate, as a substitute United States Attorney under the title 'Special Counsel,' as happened here. That appointment was unlawful, as are all the legal actions that have flowed from it, including Smith's prosecution of President Trump.""

The implications are ""nothing short of historic, and it is imperative that no former President of this Nation—especially one who is the presumptive opposition-party candidate to become President once again—go to trial and risk conviction of a crime if his prosecutor is not even authorized to speak for the United States,"" it adds.
The filing comes after federal prosecutors pressed Cannon on Friday to schedule a trial for this summer in the classified documents case, one of four criminal prosecutions that Trump is facing as he seeks to reclaim the White House.
The case had been scheduled to go to trial on May 20, but Cannon has signaled that she plans to reconsider that date. Trump's lawyers contend there is no way to hold a fair trial this year when Trump is moving towards clinching the Republican presidential nomination.
Meanwhile, uncertainty surrounds a separate federal case in Washington—also brought by Smith—that charges Trump with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election.
Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in late April on whether Trump is immune from prosecution in that case.",2024-03-06T13:01:46Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
"Alabama Barker Shares Eerie Message from Kanye West, Fans Think Ex Kim Kardashian is ‘So Mad’","Travis Barker’s daughter Alabama Barker has created quite a buzz in the entertainment industry with her flamboyant personality. When she isn’t serving some pretty impressive fashion statements, she has shown a keen interest in the music industry. Previously, she shared a video of herself in a recording studio, vibing to a rhythmic beat on Instagram, per Inquisitr. Besides being a fan of her Blink-182 drummer dad, Alabama is also a fan of famous rapper Kanye West. The youngster shared a snap of a message from him, leading fans to assume it might irk his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, per The U.S. Sun.
Image Source: Getty Images | Photo by Rachpoot
Alabama shared a screenshot of West’s tweet on X, formerly Twitter, which read: “I wish I had a friend like me,” on her Instagram Stories late into the night. However, since West’s account on the platform has been inactive, do note that it was an old tweet.
Image Source: Instagram | @alabamaluellabarker
West had shared the controversial tweet back in 2013. Furthermore, Alabama's dad is married to West’s ex-wife’s sister, Kourtney Kardashian. As such, The Kardashians fandom is abuzz with suggestions, mentioning that perhaps West’s ex-wife might be a bit disgruntled at her step-niece’s Story on the Gram. A Reddit forum prompted a conversation by stating, “Funny how Labama likes YE. Actually, Kourt and her whole little Rock star of a family are still supporting him! I’m not mad at him but Kim is.” One observant user recalled the time Kim and her sister Khloe Kardashian ‘hung out’ with Scott Disick, Kourtney’s ex-husband, and compared it to the current circumstances: Barker’s alleged support for West.
The user wrote: “Well, last season, Kim & Khloe hung out with Scott a few times and talked smack about Kourtney with him.” The person continued, “And let’s not forget the birthday party Kris [Jenner] & Khloe had for Scott.” Lastly, the supposed fan justified Barker’s support for Ye just like her step-aunties supported Disick. The user wrote, “Fair is fair.” In a thread, a second person agreed with the previous person, noting, “Exactly! I’ve been hoping Kourtney and Travis would end up reaching out to Ye [West]. It’s what Kim deserves.”
Alabama's actions on Instagram beg the question: Have the Barkers been in contact with the rapper, or is this just the young adult’s way of expressing her affinity for West’s comments? That remains to be seen. Nonetheless, representatives of Alabama and West have refrained from commenting about their possible inkling with each other. Moreover, Alabama seems to have undergone a social media purge. After much backlash due to her allegedly risque ensemble, she seems to have deleted almost all posts from her page. However, she didn’t delete her adorable photoshoot with a few goats! Barker captioned the post saying, “Goats day.”",2024-03-06T09:10:42Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Kanye West invites fans to 'Vultures"" listening party in San Francisco","Kanye West is inviting Bay Area fans to come on out and listen to his latest album.
The controversial, multiplatinum-selling rapper — who goes by Ye these days — is having a listening party for his latest platter on March 12 at Chase Center in San Francisco.
Fans will get to hear the new album that West collaborated on with fellow rapper Ty Dolla $ign — “Vultures 1” — at the event, which begins at 9:30 p.m. The music will be delivered via “a hi-fidelity audio experience,” according to a news release.
And, no, we don’t have any clue what that means either.
What we do know is that tickets for the “Vultures” listening party go on sale at 12 noon March 6, ticketmaster.com. Ticket prices, however, are not being listed on the site.
It’s unclear whether West will be in attendance at this event, but he has appeared at other previous “Vultures” listening parties. It’s also unclear whether Ty Dolla $ign will show up or not.
Previous “Vultures” events have featured a number of guest appearances, including from North West (Ye’s daughter with Kim Kardashian), Offset, Kodak Black, Lil Durk and Freddie Gibbs, according to the New York Post.
“Vultures 1,” which topped the Billboard 200 after hitting stores in February, is the first in what appears to be a trio of “Vultures” releases from the two rappers. Volumes 2 and 3 are reportedly set to be released in March and April, respectively.",2024-03-06T01:45:59Z,https://www.mercurynews.com,The Mercury News
"French Montana Shares Behind The Scenes Footage Of Kanye West Working On ""Vultures 2""","Last month, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign finally released their long-awaited new album VULTURES 1. The project was originally just supposed to consist of one album but was expanded for a full three-volume experience. Because West has been known to promise projects and never formally deliver before, fans are skeptical that all three promised projects would be released. But they recently got some promising news that Ty and West are, in fact, still hard at work. That came from a video shared by French Montana earlier this week.
""Back to work @tydollasign @ye Vultures 2 coming soon"" the caption over the video reads. That video itself is a relatively short clip that really just shows the three in the studio, though the implication is that they're cooking up some new material. It also doesn't confirm whether or not Montana is due to appear on the project or is just around for the recording sessions. VULTURES 2 was originally announced for March 8, but with work on the project still seeming very much in progress it's unclear if they will make that date. Part three of the trilogy was originally announced for an early April release. Check out the video of the trio working on VULTURES 2 below.

French Montana In The Studio With Kanye West And Ty Dolla $ign
French Montana is fresh off the release of a new album of his own. Mac & Cheese 5 dropped earlier this month but was met with backlash from fans. Much of that was because of the numerous releases he shared to streaming platforms in an attempt to generate higher numbers. That culminated in a massive 126-song ""Versions"" edition of the project that was widely mocked online.
After initial projections of the new album debuting as high as number 3, it ended up debuting at number 14 after its first week. What do you think of French Montana being in the studio with Ty Dolla $ign and Kanye West? Are you hoping that he appears on VULTURES 2 when it comes out? Let us know in the comment section below.

Bianca Censori's Family Looks Content In Japan Throwbacks As Kanye West Tensions Build,"Seeing as Bianca Censori's family resides on the other side of the world, in Australia, they've had to watch much of her relationship with Kanye West play out via the tabloids rather than supporting the architect through the ups and downs of life in the public eye first-hand. In particular, the outfits that the Yeezy creator chooses to style his wife in are causing some contention. Not only with conservative people outside, but also among those who worry that Censori is a victim of exploitation and manipulation from West, which he continuously denies.
As TMZ reports, family members of the fashionista have had enough of her strutting about scantily clad. Her father, Leo Censori, is apparently eager to confront West for parading his grown child around the world in sheer looks that expose her breasts, butt, and even vagina for others to see both in person and on the internet as paparazzi photos surfaced online. Interestingly, throwback photos captured on a Censori family trip to Japan show that things last summer were much less tense between Bianca and her parents.

In June 2023, the foreigners headed to teamLab Planets, an immersive art museum in Tokyo. This is said to be the first time West met his new in-laws face to face, and though the lyricist isn't included in the snaps, it's clear that the Censoris weren't bothered by their daughter exposing some side-boob in her beige top.
Since we can't share the Censori family vacation photos directly on HNHH, you can see them here. Elsewhere in the world of Kanye West, the father of four is using his platform to speak out on recent comments from James Blake regarding pay disparity within the music industry. Read what Ye and others had to say at the link below, and check back in later for more updates on the Graduation rapper, Bianca Censori, and our other favourite celebrities.

Bianca Censori was seen taking selfies and smiling with her family members months before her dad reportedly expressed concern about her “trashy” outfits.
Censori appeared to be in good spirits with her parents, Leo Censori and Alexandra Censori, and sister Angelina Censori during a family trip to Tokyo in June 2023 in newly surfaced photos obtained by TMZ.
The foursome sat on a glass floor at an immersive art museum while Bianca, 29, held up a cellphone to snap a group selfie.

Bianca’s husband, Kanye West, was not spotted at the exhibit, but he reportedly met his in-laws during the Japanese vacation last summer.
The “Gold Digger” rapper, 46, and his wife spent at least a few weeks in the capital, as they were also seen enjoying a day at a Hello Kitty theme park with his daughter North West.
It is unclear whether the Censoris met the 10-year-old, whom Kanye shares with his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.

Fast-forward to present day, and Leo is believed to be furious over Ye’s influence on his daughter.
“Bianca’s father, Leo, wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” a source claimed to the Daily Mail last week.
The insider added that Leo even “wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North or Chicago were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.”

“Leo honestly wants to just sit Kanye down to let him know that he is hurting her family by turning his beloved daughter into a trashy-looking marketable commodity,” the source said.

The insider further claimed the Grammy winner has been “shutting [Bianca] out from her own family” amid their concerns.
“No man should ever encourage the woman that he loves to walk out in public and present herself like this. That isn’t love. That is control,” they continued.

"Thuram tra moda e musica: ""Darmian il più stiloso. Kanye West? Bella questa rilevanza dell'Inter""","Ricorre spesso la parola sogno nelle parole rilasciate da Marcus Thuram al magazine GQ. Ma quello che sta vivendo all'Inter, per sua diretta ammissione, non è affatto un sogno. E non si parla solo del puro aspetto sportivo, ma anche dei legami che il calcio e i nerazzurri in particolare stanno creando con la moda: ""Ogni giorno sempre di più il calcio, la cultura pop e la cultura street si stanno legando. Così quando arrivo all’Inter e vedo che abbiamo Moncler come partner, oppure che mentre gioco ho i Transformers sulla maglia o le Tartarughe Ninja, be’, capisci che non ho bisogno di sognare. È la realtà"".
Ma chi è il compagno più stiloso? ""Questo non posso dirlo. Anche perché lo stile è un qualcosa di così personale che non è possibile decretare il più stiloso in assoluto. Sei tu che ti metti i vestiti, non posso decidere io cosa ti devi mettere o dire che qualcuno si sta vestendo male. Se è comodo e confident in quegli abiti, be’, allora sono gli abiti giusti. Però, se dovessi scegliere uno che secondo me si veste molto bene nel mio spogliatoio, sicuramente direi Matteo Darmian. Lui è stiloso"".

Löst Kritik von Bianca Censoris Vater Beziehungsstreit aus?,"Die Beziehung von Kanye West (46) und Bianca Censori könne aufgrund des heftigen Kommentars ihres Vaters Leo Censori anfangen zu bröckeln! Das berichtet Mirror und beruft sich auf die Einschätzungen der Beziehungsexpertin Louella Alderson. ""Es könnte zu Spannungen zwischen Bianca und Kanye führen, wenn sie wegen des öffentlich gemachten Konflikts zwischen ihren Familien in eine unangenehme Lage gebracht werden!"", merkt sie an und vermutet weiter: ""Bianca hat wahrscheinlich eine Menge Leute, die sich privat und öffentlich um sie sorgen, was sie vielleicht lieber ignoriert.""
Andererseits könne die Äußerung von Biancas Vater auch etwas Positives mit sich bringen und das Verhältnis zwischen der 29-Jährigen und dem Rapper sogar stärken – die Worte können nämlich auch Anstoß dazu geben, dass sich beide unausgesprochener Konflikte annehmen und diese klären. ""Es kann ein Katalysator für sie sein, ein offenes und ehrliches Gespräch über ihre Beziehung zu führen und über alle Bedenken, die sie diesbezüglich haben"", erklärt die Expertin. So oder so sei sie der Annahme, dass der Kommentar Auswirkungen auf das Ehepaar haben wird.
Hintergrund dieser Einschätzung ist ein Vorfall, der sich vor wenigen Tagen ereignete – der Vater des Models bezeichnete seine Tochter nämlich als eine ""billige Trophäe"" und gab ihrem Ehemann die Schuld daran. Vor allem die ziemlich freizügigen Outfits der Architektin seien ihrem Papa ein besonderer Dorn im Auge. Gegenüber Daily Mail plauderte ein Insider aus, dass Leo den Musiker wohl darauf ansprechen wolle, denn er mache sich Sorgen um die Stiefmutter von North West (10).

"'Geeky Bianca Censori pinned hopes on design career before sponge Kanye West misdirected her, one small step at a time'","BIANCA Censori shot to fame overnight when she married Kanye West, and at the time, she had what appeared to be a glittering career ahead of her.
But it seems like the Aussie's architectural designer dreams have gone off the rails, and a psychologist says Bianca has been ""open to manipulation and coercion"" by her rapper husband — possibly since she set foot in the US.
8 Jo Hemmings told The U.S. Sun that in her enthusiasm for success, Bianca Censori had been misdirected by Kanye West Credit: Getty
8 Bianca had a quiet determination about her – making her 2020 Facebook video all about her subject matter, said a psychologist Credit: Facebook
In February, Bianca, 29, shared a video on Facebook titled Throwback Yeezy Designs 2020.
In it, she spoke about her designs and work at Yeezy.
""This is a project that I developed for residents that essentially explores really what it means to be humbled by nature,"" she explained.
The University of Melbourne alum mentioned ""primitive futurism"" and showed a diagram labeled ""The Future of Space, Stephen Hawking.""
Psychologist Jo Hemmings said Bianca came off as “shy"" and ""highly educated"" in the clip.
Bianca’s LinkedIn profile shows she is still employed as Head of Architecture at Yeezy, the clothing brand owned by Kanye, 46.
Hemmings said Bianca's 2020 Facebook reel showed moments of discomfort in front of the camera.
“Bianca shared her expertise and knowledge and appeared to be hoping for success in her chosen design career,” she said.
“She was precise about who and what she was.
“Bianca was very articulate, even if a little apprehensive and momentarily uncomfortable in front of the camera.
“She had a quiet determination about her — making her video all about her subject matter.
“This young woman was even a little geeky and shy in her delivery.
“We can see a super bright, highly educated, hugely talented woman in this video from 2020.""
But Hemmings said that's a far cry from what people see now.
“Fast forward to 2024, and Bianca has been relentlessly exploited and manipulated,"" she said.
“In her enthusiasm for success and obvious ambition, Bianca has been misdirected, a small step at a time.”
Before jetting to the US to take up a new role at Yeezy, Bianca completed Bachelor's and Master's degrees in architecture.
She worked at a company in Melbourne called Kelektic and DP Toscano Architects as a design consultant.
“It’s pretty amazing to get into that behemoth of an organization at such a young age,” Joe Toscano told the Sydney Morning Herald in 2022.
“She obviously made an impression on Kanye West, and she made that impression because she’s actually very talented.”
8 Bianca (seen here in May 2022) showed her excitement about her new role with Yeezy and working for Kanye, said an expert Credit: Splash
In December 2023, Bianca had married Kanye in secret.
She also became a stepmom to her husband's four children whom he shares with ex Kim Kardashian, 43: North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 5.
Hemmings said her Facebook reel exposed high levels of knowledge.
But she claimed the twenty-something designer was open to exploitation.
“Bianca discussed elements of complex science,"" she said.
Bianca may be intellectually smart, but not so street savvy to potential exploitation at that point. Jo Hemmings
""In the reference to the Stephan Hawking diagram, we can see high levels of expertise and ambition.
“It is impressive and shows her excitement about her new role with Yeezy and working for Kanye.
“She wanted to make her mark in Los Angeles, but in her design world.
“There was perhaps uncertainty about how she would do it at this stage.
8 It would appear that Bianca (seen here with Kanye in 2023)has been convinced through persuasion, manipulation, temptation, said an expert Credit: Instagram/ ARKANGEL
“Perhaps in that sense, Bianca's lack of experience means she was open to influence.
""She may have been open to manipulation and coercion.
“Bianca may be intellectually smart, but not so street savvy to potential exploitation at that point.”
Kanye’s wife was dressed in black in the 2020 footage, with her hair combed to the side and framing her face.
“Lovely to see you talking don’t think you're allowed to speak when with ye always looks unhappy,"" one follower commented on the reel.
“I wonder if she knew then she was going to be walking around America naked never really wearing any clothes,” commented another.
8 It is hard to believe that Bianca is dressing as she does now with Kanye, said an expert Credit: Getty
Hemmings said that four years ago, Bianca focused on her knowledge rather than her appearance.
“Aside from the personality change, Bianca was dressed conservatively in the Facebook clip with her hair parted to the side,” she said.
“Bianca wanted to fade into the background in her video.
""The focus was meant to be on her words rather than her looks.
“It is hard to believe that she is dressing as she does now with Kanye.
Kanye is like a narcissistic, delusional sponge ... he just absorbs the fact he thinks he is a genius Jo Hemmings
“We can only assume Kanye chooses all this and has overwhelmed her to the point that she looks absurd.
“There are all these bizarre combinations of minimal clothing.
“Bianca is now under threat of being prosecuted for indecent exposure in Paris.”
On Wednesday, Bianca was photographed in Paris putting on an affectionate display with Kanye.
She had ditched her underwear and wore a see-through black dress.
8 Bianca (seen here with Kanye in January) has lost her self-esteem and self-identity since 2020, according to a psychologist Credit: Instagram
Her husband, at one point, placed his arms around her waist.
Hemmings believes before now, Kanye had chosen Bianca as a ""victim.""
“Kanye is like a narcissistic, delusional sponge — he may not even have heard of Stephen Hawking, as Bianca has,"" she said.
“He just absorbs the fact he thinks he is a genius.
""Kanye likes to compare himself to almost anyone he believes falls into that category.
""This includes Jesus Christ and God to Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Martin Luther King, and Obama.
“Kanye could have been looking out for a talented person.
Bianca has seemingly little control over her life or how she presents herself publicly. Jo Hemmings
""He may have searched for someone with the right amount of vulnerability and ambition to choose as his victim.
“Bianca has seemingly little control over her life or how she presents herself publicly.
“It would appear that she has been convinced through persuasion, manipulation, temptation, and fear.
“She had everything to look forward to in life, both personally and professionally.
“Now Bianca has become someone who is being made a mockery of.
“There was a person in that 2020 video with many hopes and aspirations for her life.
“I hope Bianca is not lost forever.
""Bianca has lost her self-esteem and self-identity.
""She will now need a lot of counseling and therapy to find that ambitious young woman again we saw in 2020.”

Kanye West Reportedly Can’t Play in Concert Venues Across Europe Because of ‘Controversial Image’,"Kanye West is apparently having trouble finding venues for concerts because of his 'controversial' image. After recently releasing the Vultures album, the rapper is reportedly scouring for locations to perform across the globe. Unfortunately, his search in Europe seems to be yielding nothing, The Sun reported. The response to contacting promoters in Munich, Berlin, Cologne, Madrid, and other cities was emphatically no.

Despite having a sizable fan base, the source asserts that 'it will be very, very hard' for the controversial rapper to perform in Europe. The rapper is scheduled to headline the Rolling Loud festival in California on March 14. ""Now almost no companies that manage arenas or stadiums want to allow him to do shows on their venues.""

Fans labeled a recent 'listening experience' in Paris earlier this month as a 'rip-off' as the new album was played through in its entirety without Ty Dolla Sign, who has worked on the record, or Ye taking the stage. The insider went on to say that intense emotions surround any possible return, to the point that even the event's organizers in the French capital have faced criticism.

The 24-time Grammy winner stated earlier in February that he's finding it difficult to secure locations for his performances and hinted that his previous outbursts are to blame for this, per Page Six. The controversial figure discussed his newfound struggles on Instagram in a since-deleted video. “And you know why that is,” the rapper declared, after informing his 19 million fans on the site that he's having problems reserving arenas.

Ye was optimistic that he would be able to gain traction in Milan, where he intended to perform at the renowned San Siro soccer stadium—especially because the song Carnival featured Inter Milan supporters. However, the insider shared that 'the majority of the board' is still against the idea of allowing him to use the stadium to have his show.

"Ryan Garcia Claims His “Own People” Took Him to Psych Ward, Ropes In Kanye West, Elon Musk, and Others in Recent Social Media Rampage","LAS VEGAS, NV – APRIL 18 – Ryan Garcia at the Gervonta Davis vs Ryan Garcia Grand Arrival at the MGM GRAND in Las Vegas, Nevada on April 18, 2023 ahead of their fight this coming weekend. PUBLICATIONxNOTxINxUSA Copyright: xDeeCeexCarterx
Is Ryan Garcia milking the situation? Nobody is quite sure. KingRy, nevertheless, is sure about his “own people” trying to put him in a psych ward. Not long ago, the Victorville native was accused of being intoxicated during his press conference by opponent Devin Haney. What followed was even more unbelievable.
America’s Favorite Video Today
Many speculated whether Garcia was taking stronger intoxicants, despite the 25-year-old boxer claiming he only consumes marijuana and alcohol. A concerning clip shared by Garcia yesterday on social media added to the worry. And today, the 24-1 boxer has sent out a series of frantic tweets name-dropping Kanye West and Elon Musk.
Ryan Garcia claims that “they tried to put me in jail”

Earlier today, talkSport editor Michael Benson shared a clip initially posted by Garcia on his handle, where he claimed, “I’m okay, I’m not dead… They tried to put me in jail. They’re blocking my cards. I can’t access my money.” After this clip started circulating on X (formerly Twitter), the Victorville native went on to tweet more bizarre claims and also dished out some tenuous accusations.
In his initial tweet, Garcia brought up UFO clips, claiming they are being released and that he is not crazy. “Why [do] you think [they are] releasing UFO videos? You don’t think that [they are] not planned. Don’t be gullible, this is the truth!!!!!!! The files are being released. It’s for a reason. They will say I’m crazy. Not crazy. I just don’t care to release info,” wrote Garcia.
Garcia then addressed his upcoming fight against Haney on April 20, suggesting the fight is still on. “They can’t cancel the fight, it’s signed!! I’m laughing, [the] contract [is] signed. I’ve talked to Oscar, I told him we [are] good!!! 4-20 Barclays! No [steps] miscalculated.” Moments later, in another tweet, he asserted that he had gotten all his cards back but accused his people of “trying to take you to the psych ward.”

He even claimed the video Benson shared on X from Garcia’s Instagram was fake. He, however, wasn’t done and went on to drag in Elon Musk. “Shout out Elon for free speech,” wrote Garcia. As if that wasn’t enough, Garcia had some words for Kanye West too. “Imagine battling in spiritual warfare, and everyone acts like it’s not real and says you are the crazy one Kanye hit me. I’m sad bro,” wrote Garcia.

"Kanye West, Tyler, The Creator, And More Weigh In On James Blake's Viral Comments About The Music Industry","Earlier this week, British singer and producer James Blake made waves with his comments about the music industry. He took aim at the lack of proper pay for artists and the numerous labels and companies profiting from the work of artists. Now artists like Kanye West and Tyler, The Creator are weighing in. “If we want quality music somebody is gonna have to pay for it. Streaming services don’t pay properly, labels want a bigger cut than ever and just sit and wait for you to go viral, TikTok doesn’t pay properly, and touring is getting prohibitively expensive for most artists. The brainwashing worked and now people think music is free,"" his original statement read.
He expanded even further with more comments. “I really love music. I will continue to use my social media but only to connect with you guys. Music is my life’s purpose and I will not have mine destroyed by a bunch of labels and tech companies who don’t even pay us and exploit us relentlessly. Remember when my cover of ‘Godspeed’ went viral? Neither me nor Frank ever made a cent cause it was an ‘original sound’ in every video,"" his additional comments read.

Kanye West andBianca Censori were at the center of controversy in Italy, when reports came out that their actions have disrupted a wedding, all while law enforcement continues to investigate their recent controversial behavior.
As per Geo TV's report, the duo recently drew attention to themselves by making an unannounced appearance at a wedding in Florence, Italy. Their actions at the wedding were captured in a TikTok video, which rapidly gained thousands of views, turning them into unexpected wedding crashers.

It depicts the radiant bride and groom exchanging greetings and engaging in casual conversation with an individual presumed to be West, amidst the flashing cameras. ""Imagine getting a pic [with] Kanye West at your Italian wedding,"" the video's caption reads.
The groom, speaking to the presumed West, mentions, ""In Atlanta, we live right above Grant Park."" The man believed to be West is dressed in his characteristic all-black attire, which conceals most of his face and body, preventing his face from being visible in the video, per The Daily Mail.

According to the same report, Kanye and Bianca are currently facing a police investigation for causing a disturbance during their ongoing stay in Italy. Just last week, Kanye made international headlines when he exposed his bare buttocks during a gondola ride in Venice with Bianca. Photographers captured them in a compromising situation, leading to speculation about their behavior during the ride.
The ensuing controversy prompted the gondola company to issue a statement, stating that Kanye would no longer be allowed to use their services in the future.
Venezia Turismo Motoscafi provided a statement to the Daily Mail, highlighting that their staff had no prior knowledge of the rapper's actions on board, including the incident where he exposed himself, until the photos surfaced in the public eye last week, as reported by The Things. “The driver had to keep a lookout for traffic and did not see these obscenities, If this had happened, he would have immediately disembarked and reported the transgressors to those in authority,"" the boat rental company said as per The Things.

A week after the rapper exposed his bare buttocks while riding a river taxi in Venice with one of his Yeezy employees kneeling beside him, a police source informed the Daily Mail on Tuesday that they plan to interview the driver of the watercraft. “The images show the couple clearly in a state of intimacy, and if the local prosecutor decides to press charges, then we will notify the couple, most probably through the relevant Embassies,” the insider told the outlet.
The source stated that they had received reports from individuals who witnessed the nudity. “The offense being investigated is acts contrary to public decency, which is punishable by an administrative sanction, any breaches are severely punished,"" per Page Six.",2024-03-04T14:08:08Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"In a Shocking Outburst, Kanye West Criticizes His Ex-Wife Kim Kardashian, Over Their Children","Recently, Kanye West has been in the news for a variety of reasons unrelated to his most recent album. In one of West's most recent social media postings, he referred to Kim Kardashian and criticized Adidas for a message about his contract termination. He has repeatedly demanded that the kids be taken out of their present school.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ye (@ye)
As reported by The Mirror, in the most recent legal dispute between Adidas and Kanye West, after the latter terminated his deal for the Yeezy line, the rapper shared an alleged internal memo purportedly written by the business, which instructed staff members on how to handle the prevailing circumstances. He shared on his Instagram, ""This is the document that they give employees at Adidas when asked questions about Yeezy.""
The caption's second section discusses West's perception that his prior bipolar illness diagnosis has caused him to be stigmatized by society. Kardashian openly discussed his condition and her struggles with it after they were married.
He further added, ""There is an overlap to Adidas and Kim ignoring my opinion on where my kids go to school or people ignoring my name change or the entire celebrity culture ostracizing me for my political opinion It all comes down to human rights which you sacrifice when you’re stigmatized with mental issues All these situations are actually far crazier than what I’ve been branded to be.""

In order to get clarification on the Adidas problem, he also shared screenshots of himself chatting and contacting sneaker resale sites. West submitted a lengthy series of observations on the circumstance, including a looping in of Kardashian, along with the note.
West mentioned in his remark the recent public statement he made ordering his ex-wife to take his kids out of their present school. In a now-deleted Instagram post, he wrote: ""Kim take my kids out of Sierra Canyon now. it's a fake school for celebrities that are used by 'the system.' ... At this point everybody knows what 'the system' is code word for. I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children.""

Following West's latest outburst, fans sent him a plethora of notes, one of which expressed worry and said the rapper ""needs help."" One user commented on the post, ""Dude. Take your meds. Crying on the gram like a 12 year old girl.""
Another one added, ""Bro stop blasting the mother of your kids online shit is corny. Deal with your personal shit personally."" A third user wrote, ""You rant publicly vile antisemitic poison. You trot your poor, unfortunate wife out naked for public humiliation and future ostracizaton. You doxx your own children. You relentlessly harass an ex wife who goes above and beyond to keep you in your kid's lives regardless of aforementioned bs. But sure, you're the victim here. Not your kids, wife or ex wife.

Kanye West Posts Old Video of Daughter North Amid Ongoing Feud With Kim Kardashian,"Kanye West has been anything but silent about his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, following their split, which was confirmed in 2021 after six years of marriage. Recently, Kanye appears to have shaded Kardashian by sharing a throwback video of their daughter, North West. The provocative rapper has revived his contentious feud with Kardashian by stating that his two youngest children are unaware of who he is. Now, he has taken to his Instagram Story to post a throwback video of his eldest daughter, potentially interpreted as a subtle jab at his ex-wife, according to Mirror's report.

The video captured a heartwarming moment between father and daughter as they joyfully danced together during Sunday Service in 2019. Kanye sang his hit song Lift Yourself to his daughter, who danced enthusiastically in front of a crowd. North, beaming with joy, took center stage and smiled widely as her father sang to her. The adorable clip was initially shared by a fan with a touching caption. It read, ""North West vibing to Lift Yourself by Kanye West during Sunday Service in 2019. Then Kanye started singing to her."" Yet, Kanye wasn't the only admirer of the nostalgic video.

Numerous social media users took to the video's comment section to share their thoughts. One user commented, ""It's important to have both of your parent in your life. It boosts your confidence to another level."" Another user wrote, ""Dats a special moment wit his daughter."" A third user stated, ""Man this makes me feel good."" Another user gushed, ""We love ye and Northie forever!!"" In addition to those fans, many other admirers of the father-daughter duo expressed their love and admiration, showering them with praise. Kanye's recent post follows his social media outburst directed at his ex-wife, Kardashian.
In a surprising move on social media, rapper Kanye has urged Kardashian to remove their children from what he calls a ""fake school."" The former couple are parents to four children including North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. According to OK! Magazine, Kanye said, ""Kim take my kids out of Sierra Canyon now, it's a fake school for celebrities that are used by 'the system'."" He also said, ""At this point, everybody knows what 'the system' is code word for. I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate.

Kanye's recent public comments about his children's education aren't the first. His previous remarks led Kardashian to increase security measures in 2022 at her kids' school. The reality TV star reportedly spent more on security following Kanye's series of outbursts. This incident follows his earlier implication that he only had contact with 10-year-old North after she tore up couches to reach him. He mentioned this during a 10-minute rant in December of last year. He said his daughter ""ripped up the mother f**king couches in the house to be able to be with me right now.""",2024-03-04T05:22:12Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

Adin Ross Apologizes To Kanye West After Bianca Censori Intervenes
Elsewhere, Adin Ross recently apologized for his previous comments about Kanye struggling to get brand deals. According to Ross, he had been driven to make the rare apology after Kanye's wife, Bianca Censori, reached out to Ross to set the record straight. Ross confirmed he had received an email directly from Censori asking him to retract his statements.
Ross had tried to continue his trend of paying rappers to appear on his streams by saying he had the backing of Kick and Stake to pay Kanye for an appearance. This was taken as Ross saying that either Kanye is broke or that Kanye needs the charity. Ross backpedaled during his apology, stating that what he meant is that streaming services were not paying Kanye because ""they're not throwing money at anyone."" Do you believe Ross' apology? Do you consider it an apology at all? Let us know in the comments.

"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign Boast ""VULTURES 1"" Success Without Apple Music Support","Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's VULTURES 1 is still getting plenty of play, despite how streaming platforms were not so quick to promote it. Moreover, Ye published a video on his Instagram Story of his full-length collaborator remarking on how Apple Music never featured them on most of their promotional features on their page for new releases, which they typically do for almost all big releases. Yet ""CARNIVAL"" with Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti is the highest-charting song on Apple Music right now. Given that the album went No. 1 on Billboard for another week after its release, this consistent commercial success is unsurprising.
However, it's also important to note that Kanye West is not only one of the biggest artists alive -– and thus needs no promotion to make a splash -– but that the duo devised a promotional strategy of their own. Their Vultures listening parties across the U.S. and Europe netted them heaps of cash and built up the album across a couple of months of hype. In addition, we have Ye's antisemitic crusade to consider as a massive and sadly unfinished story that boosted this collaboration's profile. It's very understandable that streaming services didn't promote it at every turn, but equally unsurprising is how their notoriety and reach sidestepped that.
Read More: Timbaland Says “Vultures 2” Is “On The Way”
Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign Flaunt Their No. 1 Despite Apple Music's Lack Of Promo
Another factor to consider is that across February, whether or not you could listen to VULTURES 1 depended on which streamer you used and what day you tried to play it. The album disappeared from Spotify and Apple Music multiple times thanks mostly to distribution difficulties, as well as sample clearance issues that already plagued the release. Whether or not you find its commercial success in spite of this to be impressive or a sad reality probably depends on whether you buy into the controversies attached to it. Regardless, Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign fought their way in with loads of fans behind them.
Meanwhile, with two more installments set for release (which we aren't holding our breath on considering the chaotic launch of the first one) and a Ye solo album facing conflicting reports, who knows what they'll do in March? VULTURES 2, plus 3 in April, could be better than the first one, or it could be just as divisive. But odds are that whatever long-form effort they drop will still hit big.

Pais da esposa de Kanye West não querem que ela tenha filhos,"Bianca Censori, Kanye West / Reprodução TV / Instagram
Segundo o jornal “Daily Mail” Bianca Censori tem planos de ter filhos com Kanye West, mas os pais da arquiteta australiana não apoiam de jeito nenhum, devido à forma como pensam que o rapper trata sua filha.
Pai de Bianca Censori quer falar com Kanye West
Uma fonte contou à publicação que os sogros de Ye o consideram um ‘marido controlador’ e “incapaz de fornecer um lar estável para criar seus netos”.
Kanye cantou em sua música “Timbo Freestyle” ter outro filho é seu objetivo final: “Você já sabe que sou impulsivo / e outro bebê é meu objetivo final”, cantou o pai de North, 10, Saint, oito, Chicago, seis, e Psalm, quatro.
Sem Apoio
Bianca, que assumiu um papel ativo como madrasta dos quatro filhos de Kanye, parece ter o mesmo objetivo do marido:

“É claro que ela discutiu planos de bebê com sua família (…) Leo e Alexandra [pais de Censori] querem que seus filhos cresçam em um lar ‘estável’ e sentem que Kanye não é capaz de proporcionar isso”, afirma o informante.
“Ele é o marido dela, então é claro que ela falou sobre isso e ser madrasta dos filhos de Kanye só tornou seu desejo de ter filhos mais forte”, justifica a fonte.

“Houve um tempo em que os pais dela apoiavam que ela tivesse filhos com Kanye, mas ninguém acredita neste momento que engravidar e ter um bebê agora seja uma boa ideia”, comentou uma pessoa próxima, depois que eles viram a filha sair sem calcinha em público.
Somando-se a essa instabilidade estão as roupas que Bianca usa por ordens de West:
A fonte continuou: “Os pais dela estão muito angustiados com isso porque não a reconhecem. Ela não estaria fazendo isso a menos que estivesse sendo controlada.”
Confronto
O pai de Bianca quer confrontar o polêmico rapper “e perguntar o que diabos ele está pensando quando desfila com Bianca como um troféu nu e inútil”, disse o informante.
Kim Kardashian recusa pedido de Kanye West
“Ele quer perguntar a Kanye o que ele faria se suas filhas North, ou Chicago, fossem vistas em público seminuas em trajes incentivados por seus maridos…”

But after approaching promoters in Madrid, Berlin, Cologne and Munich, the answer was a resounding no.
He also tested the water in Asia, Australia and the Middle East, and was met with a similar response.
A music insider claims ""it will be very, very hard"" for the controversial rapper, who is slated to play the Rolling Loud festival in California on March 14, to perform in Europe, despite maintaining a solid fanbase.
""His reputation and the controversies in the last few years are the main reason for this,"" the source explained to The U.S. Sun.
""Now almost no companies that manage arenas or stadiums want to allow him to do shows on their venues.""
A recent ""listening experience"" held in Paris earlier this month was described as a ""rip-off"" by fans after the new album was played in its entirety without Ye or Ty Dolla Sign, who has collaborated on the new material, picking up a microphone.
The source added even the organizers for the event in the French capital have come under fire, illustrating the strong feelings surrounding any potential comeback.
The 46 year-old is virtually untouchable following an online rant about Jesus Christ and Hitler last December, while a stream of unconventional pictures of wife Bianca Censori have raised plenty of eyebrows.
Ye was hopeful of potentially making inroads in Milan, where he wanted to play the famous San Siro soccer stadium, especially as Inter Milan fans were featured on the song Carnival.
He was spotted watching a match in Milan last week and has good relations with Inter's ownership group.

But the insider added, ""the majority of the board are still against the idea of allowing him to use the stadium to have his show.
""They know that Kanye’s presence and having him doing shows at a stadium can have them make a lot of money, but the risk, and the image, is more important for the arenas and stadium owners. It’s going to be really, really complicated for Kanye to do shows in Europe.""
It's a similar story in Asia and Australia, according to a tour manager who works extensively in those regions.
He was stunned to see Ye suggestively post on his Instagram a list of 25 possible venues, a move described as one of the worst decisions seen in the insider's 25 year music career.
""The goal was to put pressure or lobby to get access and be able to do his shows in the list of venues that he showed on his post,"" said the source.
""But we all know that it’s clearly very complicated for him to be able to do shows or tours with his reputation and the controversies he has been involved in.""
Venues in Dubai and Tokyo were also mentioned in his Instagram post, but were left shocked at Ye's presumptuous nature.
""It's not a good way to try and start talks,"" added the industry veteran.
""These places would prefer to not make money than have Kanye perform a show there. I don't think the situation will change anytime soon, either.""

Ist ihr kalt? Bianca Censori zeigt sich im bedeckten Look!,"Mal was ganz Neues! Bianca Censori und Kanye West (46) besuchten in dieser Woche die Pariser Fashion Week und beeindruckten mal wieder mit ihrem einzigartigen Kleidungsstil. Während Kanye gerne von Kopf bis Fuß bedeckt ist, nimmt sich Bianca das Sprichwort ""Weniger ist mehr"" sehr zu Herzen. Auch in der französischen Hauptstadt war sie durch ihren transparenten Look ein Blickfang und spielte mit dem Gesetz. Nun reisen die beiden ab und Bianca zeigt sich diesmal eher bedeckt.
Nach Bildern, die TMZ vorliegen, präsentiert sich die Yeezy-Architektin in ihrem Lieblingskleidungsstück: der Strumpfhose. Mit einer blickdichten schwarzen Strumpfhose und schwarzen High Heels kombinierte Bianca ein fliederfarbenes Langarmshirt. Ihre Haare trug sie streng zurückgebunden, sodass ihr silberner Ohrschmuck zum Vorschein kam.
Doch nicht nur Bianca steht im Fokus der Medien. Der kontroverse Rapper wurde erst diese Woche aufgrund einer Urheberrechtsverletzung verklagt. Laut The Wrap soll er mit dem Rapper Ty Dolla Sign den Song ""I Feel Love"" von Donna Summer (✝63) ohne Einwilligung verwendet haben. Nun wird Kanye von ihren Hinterbliebenen zur Rechenschaft gezogen.

Bianca Censori doesn’t need to be censored in her latest outfit.
After her dad reportedly expressed concern for her scantily clad looks, the wife of Kanye West sported a more reserved outfit as she left the posh Ritz-Carlton hotel in Paris with the rapper on Saturday.
Although her outfit still clung to her every curve, she wore opaque fabric in the form of black tights and a long-sleeve purple shirt.

Censori, 29, paired her look with a large black tote and tiny heels. She wore minimal makeup and had her short, brunette hair slicked back into a bun.
West, 46, wore an all-black ensemble of sweats and a hoodie with his leather Balenciaga jacket. Censori was spotted rocking the same coat as a dress earlier this week during a nighttime outing with her eldest stepdaughter, North West, 10.
The “Praise God” rapper went without his go-to black face mask as he left their hotel, but attempted to cover some of his face by wearing his hood closed tight and pulling it up over his mouth.

Bianca opted for a more respectable outfit a day after the Daily Mail reported that her father, Leo Censori — the brother of notorious mobster Eris Censori — expressed concern over her scandalous fashion choices.
“Bianca’s father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” a source told the outlet.
“He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife.”

Zu nackt: Bianca Censoris Vater macht sich Sorgen um sie,"Er macht das nicht mehr mit! Leo Censori, der Vater von Bianca Censori, wurde im Jahr 1982 wegen Besitzes von Heroin, einer Schusswaffe und Vollmantelmunition zu fünf Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt. Nun kann er es nicht mehr mit ansehen, wie seine Tochter sich seit ihrer Ehe mit Kanye West (46) in der Öffentlichkeit verhält. Deshalb möchte Leo nun ein ernstes Wort mit seinem Schwiegersohn Kanye reden.
Laut einem Insider, der sich gegenüber Daily Mail äußerte, habe der Vater von Bianca vor, Kanye zur Rede zu stellen. Er befürchtet, dass der Rapper sie einerseits von ihrer Familie isoliert und andererseits der Öffentlichkeit zur Schau stellt. Er behauptete, dass sie von ihrem Ehemann als eine ""billige nackte Trophäe"" dargestellt worden sei und fragt sich, wie der ""Vultures""-Interpret sich fühlen würde, wenn ein Mann seine Töchter North (10) und Chicago West (6) auf die gleiche Weise behandle.
Der Grund für eine Konfrontation sei der Auftritt der Yeezy-Architektin in Paris. Beim Abendessen mit Kanye verzichtete Bianca auf ihre Unterwäsche. In der französischen Hauptstadt verstößt ihr Outfit gegen das Exhibitionismus-Gesetz. Es könnte sogar sein, dass sich die 29-Jährige vor Gericht verantworten muss.

Quem é a mulher de Kanye West que pode ser multada por suas roupas,"""Quando criança, sempre fui atraída por empreendimentos criativos, principalmente artísticos. Sempre quis ser escultora e para mim arquitetura é a união da arte e da pragmática. É o maior gesto artístico que podemos colocar na terra.

""Quando criança, passei muito tempo com minha tia, que sempre me expunha a uma variedade de arte, cinema e arquitetura"".
A arquiteta foi vista junto com Kanye pela primeira vez em janeiro de 2023. Em outubro do mesmo ano, o Daily Mail divulgou documentos mostrando que o casal, ainda em dezembro de 2022, deu entrada em um casamento — no mesmo ano do fim do divórcio com Kim Kardashian —, e a certidão foi divulgada em outubro de 2023.
No mesmo mês de entrada no casamento, dezembro de 2022, Kanye West lançou no Instagram Stories uma música com o sobrenome da modelo no título, ""Censori Overload"". Na música, Kanye diz que ""A Bíblia diz que eu não posso ter mais sexo até o casamento"", o que alguns fãs apontaram como o motivo para o casamento rápido entre eles.
A modelo também foi capa do álbum ""Vultures 1"", o primeiro de um duo entre Kanye West e a cantora Ty Dolla Sign. Nele, ela aparece de costas, nua.
A família de Bianca também já mostrou aprovar a relação. A irmã, Angelina Censori, de acordo com o Daily Mail, disse que a notícia do casamento foi emocionante.

Bianca Censoris Eltern besorgt über mögliches Baby mit Kanye,"Die Pläne von Bianca Censori und Kanye West (46), gemeinsame Kinder zu bekommen, haben bei ihrer Familie für Entsetzen gesorgt. Die Eltern der Yeezy-Architektin stehen dem Vorhaben skeptisch gegenüber und zweifeln daran, dass der Rapper ein geeignetes Zuhause für ihre Enkelkinder bieten kann. Diese Bedenken wurden laut Daily Mail durch Kanyes Ankündigung in seinem neuen Track ""Timbo Freestyle"", in dem er seinen Wunsch nach weiteren Kindern zum Ausdruck bringt, weiter verstärkt. ""Sie wollen, dass Bianca Kinder hat und würden gerne Großeltern sein, aber sie wollen auch, dass die Kinder in einem stabilen und liebevollen Haushalt aufwachsen. Das Leben mit Kanye ist überhaupt nicht stabil"", erklärt ein Insider die Gemütslage von Biancas Familie.
Die Unterstützung ihrer Eltern hat in den vergangenen Monaten nachgelassen, vor allem aufgrund einer Reihe von kontroversen öffentlichen Auftritten und Biancas zunehmend provokativer Garderobe. Besonders der Vater der Australierin sei laut dem Magazin nicht sehr angetan. ""Biancas Vater Leo möchte sich mit Kanye zusammensetzen und ihn fragen, was er sich dabei denkt, wenn er Bianca wie ein nacktes Trophäenpferd vorführt"", meinte ein weiterer Familieninsider.
Diese Diskussionen um Biancas Outfits und Kanyes mutmaßliche Kontrolle über sie sind nur Teil der Bedenken ihrer Familie. Zusätzlich sorgen Kanyes antisemitische Kommentare und die damit verbundenen Reiseverbote für Bianca, ihr Heimatland zu besuchen, für Besorgnis. Angesichts dieser Sorgen befürchten Biancas Eltern, dass ihre Tochter in der Beziehung mit Kanye nicht die nötige Stabilität und Liebe erfährt, die sie verdient. Kanye und Biancas öffentliches Verhalten und seine Äußerungen gegenüber seiner Ex-Frau Kim Kardashian (43) zeigen ein Muster, das Leo und Alexandra bezüglich ihrer Tochter tief beunruhigt.
Biancas Eltern sind nicht die einzigen, die wegen Kanyes aktueller Lebenssituation besorgt sind. Auch Kim gerät immer wieder mit dem Musiker aneinander, vor allem in Bezug auf die Erziehung der gemeinsamen Kinder. Vier Wochen zuvor gab es jedoch eine scheinbare Versöhnung zwischen dem einstigen Promi-Traumpaar: Die Ex-Partner wurden zusammen gesehen, wie sie ein Familienessen mit ihrer Tochter North West (10) und einigen Freunden in einem Luxusrestaurant in Los Angeles genossen. Wie TMZ berichtete, entschieden sich Kim und Kanye, die getrennt ankamen, für das Wohl ihrer Kinder, diese familiäre Zeit miteinander zu verbringen. Kanyes neue Partnerin war allerdings nicht anwesend.

'Sistema me separou dos meus filhos',"Kim Kardashian, Kanye West / Reprodução / YouTube
Kanye West está novamente atacando a ex-mulher Kim Kardashian nas redes sociais. Uma vez mais ele pediu publicamente à mãe de seus quatro filhos que os tirasse de seu atual colégio particular, que ele chama de “falsa escola de celebridades”.
Sogro de Kanye West quer confrontar o cantor
O rapper voltou a atacar a empresária e exigiu que ela tire as crianças do colégio Sierra Canyon:
“Sierra Canyon é uma escola falsa para celebridades que são usadas pelo ‘sistema’, escreveu Ye em letras maiúsculas no Instagram, em uma postagem posteriormente eliminada pelo rapper.
Ele legendou o post estranho, dizendo: “Neste ponto, todo mundo sabe qual é a palavra-chave ‘o sistema’. O sistema me separou do meu pai e o sistema me separou dos meus filhos”, acusou.
Esposa de Kanye West faz plantão como madrasta
O ex-casal, que se divorciou em 2021, compartilha North, de 10 anos, Saint, oito, Chicago, seis, e Psalm, quatro.
Desde a complicada separação, Kim e Ye vem discutindo sobre como criar os filhos, com Kanye sendo totalmente contra eles estudarem em uma escola que não é a dele, a Academia Donda West em homenagem à sua falecida mãe.
West implorou a Kim que tirasse seus filhos do lugar, porque acredita que lá as crianças estão sendo ‘doutrinadas’.

“Quando o sistema seleciona atletas, eles evitam trabalhar com quem tem o pai na vida porque são mais difíceis de manipular”, justificou.
Os quatro filhos frequentam a Sierra Canyon School em tempo integral, mas costumavam ter atividades extracurriculares na agora fechada Donda Academy de West, uma escola cristã particular, inaugurada pelo rapper em 2022 e batizada com o nome de sua falecida mãe, Donda West.
Kim Kardashian reclama da pouca roupa da mulher de Kanye West
Embora Ye possa não concordar com todas as técnicas parentais de Kim Kardashian, ele admitiu anteriormente que a ex-mulher tem os filhos “80% do tempo”.
Frustração
A reclamação de Kanye West chega dias depois que Kim Kardashian reclamou da pouca roupa da esposa dele, Bianca Censori.
Posteriormente, o rapper fez várias reclamações no Instagram, contra Kim e a educação dos filhos.

Segundo a imprensa inglesa, Kim exigiu a West que Bianca não ande assim, sem roupa, perto de seus filhos.

Bianca Censori’s Dad Wants to Talk to Kanye West About Her Outfits: 'Trashy Naked Trophy Pony',"According to sources, Bianca Censori's father has expressed his desire to 'sit down' and speak with her daughter's husband, Kanye West. Model Bianca, 29, ran the possibility of spending up to a year in prison or paying a big fine after showing up to the renowned annual Fashion Week in the French capital wearing translucent tights without any undergarments.

The source said, ""Bianca's father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony.

The rapper seems to be keeping Censori away from her family members, the insider said before adding, ""If this isn't bad enough, the man who is supposed to protect Mr. and Mrs. Censori's daughter is the same man that is shutting her out from her own family.""

In 1982, Leo was found guilty of having heroin, an illegal import, and was sentenced to five years in jail. He has also been found guilty of carrying a handgun and ammo. As for Bianca, her uncle Eris Censori, he's a reputed mafia hitman who was once nicknamed ""Melbourne's Al Capone,"" according to Marca. He was formerly given a death sentence for murder, but it was subsequently reduced to life in prison.

The Yeezy architect may have exposed herself when photos of her out and about in Paris surfaced online, showing her bare bottom. Due to France's strict regulations regarding nudity, her most recent outfit—which is her most revealing to date—may give rise to significant legal action. It's been sufficient to drive her father Leo to the brink. Sexual displays in public places in front of others are punished by one year in jail and a fine of €15,000, as stated in Article 222–32 of the French criminal code.
Bianca was joined on the Parisian stroll by the 46-year-old rapper, who was fully concealed in a black leather jacket, matching sweatpants, and shoes. At dinner at the celebrity hangout Ferdi, which is adored by celebs like Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, and Gigi Hadid and is known for its famed hamburgers, the duo donned the bold ensemble. Over the last year, Bianca has encountered legal issues many times. Her detractors have called for a fine for public immorality due to her skimpy Italian attire. She stunned fans last summer when, while dining with the rapper in Tuscany, she showed off her see-through nude catsuit.",2024-03-02T06:31:20Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Is Kanye West’s Australian wife Bianca Censori a muse to a genius or a brainwashed puppet in a sad freak show?,"The French pride themselves on being fashionably unshockable but judging by the expressions on some faces on Tuesday when Bianca Censori pitched up at Paris Fashion Week, it was clear that they’d finally met their match.
Mrs Kanye West emerged, silently and dead-eyed, from a giant SUV into the Ritz Hotel wearing a fur bolero jacket, black stilettos and a pair of ultra-sheer tights — but no underwear.
In a reversal of her usual policy of wearing next to nothing on her top half, the young Australian revealed her lower body in such unsparing detail that published pictures had to be blurred out on decency grounds.
Although she looked as though she was completely naked, she wasn’t quite. Under her tights she was wearing a ‘modesty’ patch, an adhesive strapless thong covering only the genitals — the type used by actors filming sex scenes.
TheNightly Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. READ NOW
Censori, an architecture graduate who drifted into the baleful orbit of the controversial superstar rapper and has reputedly never been the same again, may have worn the patch to avoid breaking the law.
She could have been liable to a possible prison sentence or €15,000 fine under a French ban on ‘deliberate sexual display’ in public.
Days later, the two incurable romantics were out again to dine at a smart restaurant in the City of Love.
Predictably, they were as determined as ever to keep causing a stir, Censori, 29, again dispensing with underwear. This time she wore a sheer black tank top and a similarly sheer pair of stockings, and held her phone over her groin.
She appeared to be wearing the same modesty patch — although it’s an ill-named accessory in their case.
For there’s nothing remotely modest about the behaviour of 46-year-old Kanye West and his strangely inanimate wife whose every public outing becomes a grotesque freak show.
And it’s a freak show, observers haven’t failed to notice, in which she is the sole exhibit.
While West dresses head-to-toe in black — sometimes adding a full-face mask — he leaves his wife to trail in his wake wearing outfits that have become progressively more revealing. And for those who wonder what on earth she is doing, progressively more worrying.
The notoriously domineering and unstable West — described by a former business associate as “a master of spectacle” and so narcissistic he appears to have a god complex — has been described as controlling by his former wife, the reality TV star Kim Kardashian (whom Censori closely resembles).

West’s treatment of his new wife appears even more extreme. It’s been reported that he issued Censori with a set of rules to live by — including what to wear and specific foods she can eat.
No wonder her family and friends — who apparently have never approved of West — are said to be concerned about what they see as her unhealthily submissive relationship with an overbearing celebrity worth $400 million, who plucked her from obscurity among the staff of his fashion company Yeezy.
If their peculiar double act is meant to be performance art, the couple have been told, the show is definitely over.
Her Italian-born father Leo Censori is reported to be among those who are upset.
“He wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” an insider told MailOnline this week.
“He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters, North or Chicago, were seen in public half‑naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.”
Censori’s background is hardly conventional. Her father is a convicted criminal who has served time in prison for heroin offences as well as possessing a firearm.
His brother Eris Censori was a notorious gangland killer, dubbed ‘Melbourne’s Al Capone’, who was given a life sentence for murder.
After graduating from university in her native Melbourne and briefly running a jewellery-design business, Censori got a job as an architectural designer at Yeezy in the U.S. in November 2020.
Barely two years later, in December 2022, she supposedly married West in a “private ceremony to celebrate their love” in Beverly Hills — just a month after he finalised his high-profile divorce from Kim Kardashian after seven years of marriage and four children.
The union’s legality has been questioned since West and Censori never filed a marriage certificate. But it’s now claimed they obtained a “confidential” licence to keep it under wraps.
Although their marital home was listed as his ranch in Wyoming, they moved into a $20,000-a-month apartment in West Hollywood.

It was in Venice last summer that the pair provoked a police investigation for breaching “standards of public decorum” after they appeared to indulge in a very public sexual act on board a water taxi crossing the lagoon.
West was pictured with his trousers down while Censori was crouching between his legs.
A few weeks later, some of her friends reportedly managed to contact her — apparently not an easy feat these days — to express their deep misgivings over her relationship with West.
She was not only unreceptive but accused them of being “jealous of her stardom”, it is claimed. “Bianca knows how to grab headlines now… it gives her what she has always wanted — fame,” said a source.
And yet the same source also said that Censori had been “brainwashed” by the star. Another insider has said Censori, normally an outspoken and lively personality, is “stuck”.
Of course, she could be both complicit in the charade and under West’s control.
A former colleague who knows Censori from her time at Yeezy told the Mail this week that Bianca genuinely believes she is West’s “muse” and is happy to put up with his controlling ways and difficult temperament as she regards him as a genius.
After she returned to Australia on a solo trip late last year, some of her old girlfriends — who have described Censori as a “social butterfly” — said they thought they might have convinced her to distance herself from West. Their optimism was clearly misplaced.
Even so, incurring the displeasure of Censori’s friends and robust family is unlikely to matter one jot to a celebrity who surrounds himself with bodyguards and whose various homes are on the other side of the world to Melbourne.

Describing his bipolar disorder (a condition that some insist explains his bafflingly obnoxious conduct) as his “superpower”, West has compared himself to Picasso, Shakespeare and even Jesus.
Suspicions that he regards Bianca Censori as his artistic creation were strengthened on January 2 when he posted a picture of his nearly-naked wife to his 20 million Instagram followers and — as matter of factly as if he were announcing forthcoming tour dates — proclaimed there would be “no pants this year”.
If that was an instruction rather than a prediction, she has more than complied. Underwear, not to mention trousers, are definitely “out” for 2024 as Bianca has experimented with a transparent raincoat and other outfits that have revealed her nakedness underneath. And her husband wants the world to know it.
Having stripped down his name to Ye, he revels in his wife stripping down literally and then posting provocative photos of her on social media to his slathering male fans.
In January, for instance, he provided one of the back views of Censori preparing food in a kitchen, wearing virtually nothing but knee-high black boots and a shiny black latex mask.
As for her social media activity, it’s been reported that West “banned” Censori from having her own accounts to protect her from negative comments (although sources close to her see it as a way of further “isolating” her from reality).
Last month, the ludicrous pair stepped out at a Milan fashion show, Censori wearing an outlandish black leather outfit that looked like a bin liner — possibly designed by West — and revealed yet again she had nothing underneath.
(On this occasion she managed a smile, reassuring some online observers that perhaps she may not be entirely in thrall to him).
As social media critics accuse him of exploiting Censori and raise fears for her wellbeing, West is completely unrepentant.
In an expletive-filled online diatribe he said he posted so many shocking pictures of her “cause she makes me happy”, adding: “If you don’t like my page and don’t like what I’m posting, go f*** yourself. Seriously, leave me — leave the king — the f*** alone.”
Certainly, the way the “king” behaves with Censori tallies with how he behaves in general nowadays: ridiculously self-important and tiresomely fixated on courting controversy.
Although some who know West say he can be extraordinarily generous to total strangers, it is his darker side that has increasingly come to the fore.
West, whose monstrous ego convinced him to announce a disastrous run for the US Presidency in 2020, has praised Hitler, described slavery as a “choice” and vowed (long before the present conflict in Gaza) to go to war with the Jewish people.

Both sportswear giant Adidas and fashion house Balenciaga severed ties with him in 2022 over his anti-Semitic remarks, cutting his billionaire status to that of a mere multi-millionaire.
Last October, it emerged that Adidas had for years tolerated his obnoxious and thuggish behaviour because Yeezys, the shoes he designed for the company, were bringing in $1 billion a year.
Insiders said West demanded Adidas executives watch pornography to “spark creativity”, advised a Jewish manager at the company to kiss a picture of Hitler every day, hurled shoes around meetings and frequently played the race card by claiming he was the German company’s “slave”.
He even hired porn actresses to appear in Yeezy promotional photos.
His attitude to women has always been questionable. In 2016, years after storming on stage at an awards ceremony to say Taylor Swift didn’t deserve to win, he released a song with the lyrics: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b**** famous.”
Just over a month ago, the notoriously moody West let fly when a female reporter in LA asked him about his treatment of Censori. “Some people say you’re controlling her,” she ventured.
The rapper grabbed her phone and berated her for three minutes for daring to question a “grown-ass superhero” and “legend” like him.
“You think ‘cause you a white woman that you can walk up on me like that and ask me some dumb ass s*** like that? Ask me about my wife?”
He added: “Do you have free will or you work for the devil?”
All this garbled talk of superheroes, legends and devils will encourage those who argue that West isn’t just addicted to attention but is mentally ill.
Some believe West’s deteriorating mental state is rooted in the sudden death of his beloved mother, Donda Williams, aged 58, back in 2007.
An English literature academic, she raised him largely on her own in Chicago and later became a rock of advice and support as he rose to fame.
Although she’d hoped he would follow her into academia, she is credited with imbuing him with a steely self-confidence and a sense of black pride.
She died from a heart attack during cosmetic surgery and West has blamed himself, saying she would never have had the surgery if she hadn’t come out to live with him under the spotlight in LA.
However, one has to wonder how much longer his defenders can make excuses for him.

The rapper — who now goes by Ye — took to Instagram Thursday night (Feb. 29) to share photo of an alleged corporate document instructing the apparel giant’s employees how to talk to consumers about the company selling the Yeezy line once again.
With a publish date of Feb. 26, the alleged internal doc explains: “Adidas is the sole owner of the product, including the design rights for existing products as well as previous colorways. The products are existing Yeezy designs initiated in 2022. Adidas honored contractual obligations and discussed releasing products prior to the announcement with the former partner.”
The document also appears to ask employees to not continue extensive conversations with customers surrounding the Yeezy line, and instead points them to a general email to voice their concerns.
Trending on Billboard
“This is the document that they give employees at adidas when asked questions about Yeezy,” the rapper claimed in the caption of his post. “There is an overlap to adidas and Kim ignoring my opinion … or people ignoring my name change or the entire celebrity culture ostracizing me for my political opinion It all comes down to human rights which you sacrifice when you’re stigmatized with mental issues All these situations are actually far crazier than what I’ve been branded to be.”
Billboard has reached out to reps for Adidas for comment, and has not yet been able to verify the veracity of the document. Billboard has also contacted reps for Ye and Kim Kardashian, who was married to the rapper from 2014 to 2022.
Adidas announced Monday that it would sell some of its remaining Yeezy inventory, after splitting with Ye in 2022 following his string of hate speech and antisemitic comments. Since discontinuing the partnership, Adidas says it has donated some proceeds from such sales to groups that “combat discrimination and hate, including racism and antisemitism.”
After Adidas’ announcement this week that Yeezys are returning to the market, Ye put the brand on blast for selling “fake Yeezys” and called for his fans to boycott the company altogether.
“Anybody who loves Ye would not buy these fake Yeezys I never made these color ways I’m not getting paid off of them and adidas is suing me,” he wrote at the time. “All the new non-approved 350’s are cooorny and everybody know the 350 been corny.”
He also alleged that Adidas was suing him for $250 million, but as of earlier this week, there’s no evidence that Adidas has filed any kind of new lawsuit against West or his companies.
However, Adidas disclosed that it had filed a private arbitration case against West’s Yeezy LLC in December 2022 on the grounds that the rapper’s “racist, antisemitic, and other offensive public statements and conduct” had violated their partnership agreement and had caused “considerable damage to its brand.”
West may be referring to the arbitration case in claiming that the athletic wear brand was “suing” him. It’s unclear whether $250 million is at stake in that case, or whether that case is still ongoing, since arbitration proceedings are litigated behind closed doors.
The company started to sell Yeezy products again in May 2023 after cutting ties with West in the year prior.",2024-03-01T21:14:31Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Bianca Censori's Father Slams Kanye West For Her ""Half-Naked"" Fashion Statements","It's no secret that Kanye West's whirlwind romance with Bianca Censori has stirred up some controversy in recent months. Their dynamic is rumored to have sparked concern among her loved ones, with speculation that she's being controlled by the Chicago MC running rampant. Her scandalous fashion statements, which have grown only more revealing over time, also continue to fuel these suspicions. It appears that even the Australian model's family members aren't a fan of her flashy fits, according to Daily Mail.
Reportedly, they disapprove of how Ye's turned Bianca into a “trashy commodity,” and fear that he's pushing her away from those she was once close with. “Bianca’s father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye,"" a source explains. ""And ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony.""

Leo Wants To Confront Ye Over Bianca Censori's Outfits
“He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands,"" the source continues. ""He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife.""
“No man should ever encourage the woman that he loves to walk out in public and present herself like this. That isn’t love. That is control,” the source also adds. Some of Bianca's latest head-turning pieces have included sheer tights with no panties, a see-through top that left little to the imagination, and more.

Kanye West & Bianca Censori: Hat ihre Freizügigkeit bald Konsequenzen?,"Kanye West (46) und seine Ehefrau Bianca Censori (29) weilen im Moment im Rahmen der Pariser Fashion Week in der französischen Hauptstadt. Mit ihren knappen Outfits, die so gut wie nichts verbergen, sorgt die 29-Jährige seit Tagen für Furore. Zuletzt wurde sie bei einem Restaurantbesuch an der Seite ihres Gatten lediglich in einer transparenten Strumpfhose, einem durchsichtigen, schwarzen Top sowie einer kurzen Fell-Jacke gesichtet. Darunter trug sie natürlich keine Unterwäsche.
Sind ihr ihre freizügigen Outfits, die ihre intimsten Körperstellen freigeben, unangenehmer als bisher gedacht? Auf Paparazzi-Fotos, die die ""Daily Mail"" veröffentlichte, ist zu sehen, wie Bianca Censori versucht, beim Verlassen des Lokals ihren Intimbereich mithilfe ihres Telefons notdürftig zu bedecken. An ihrem Blick lässt sich jedoch kaum eine Emotion ablesen.
Hat das vermeintliche Unbehagen etwas mit rechtlichen Konsequenzen zu tun? Oder doch eher mit familiären Schwierigkeiten? Zum einen berichtet die ""Daily Mail"" außerdem, dass Kanye Wests Ehefrau mit einer Gefängnisstrafe oder einer Geldstrafe von umgerechnet 15.000 Euro rechnen müsse, da ihre Outfits die Gesetze gegen Exhibitionismus in Paris tangieren. Dies könnte demnach für Ärger mit den französischen Behörden sorgen, wenn sich herausstellen würde, dass sie gegen die dortigen Anstandsgesetze verstoße.
Für die radikalen, teils obszönen Looks soll derweil Kanye West höchstpersönlich verantwortlich sein. Ein Umstand, der Censoris Vater überhaupt nicht in den Kram passen soll. ""Daily Mail"" zufolge soll Elia ""Leo"" Censori (69) überaus geschockt auf den jüngsten Nackt-Auftritt seiner Tochter reagiert haben. ""Biancas Vater Leo will sich mit Kanye zusammensetzen und ihn fragen, was er sich dabei denkt, wenn er Bianca wie eine schäbige nackte Trophäe vorführt"", so eine der 29-Jährigen nahestehende Quelle.
Censoris Vater frage sich demnach offenbar, was Kanye West tun würde, ""wenn seine Töchter North und Chicago in der Öffentlichkeit halb nackt in Outfits gesehen würden, zu denen sie von ihren Ehemännern ermutigt wurden"", heißt es weiter. Der 69-Jährige könne sich nicht vorstellen, dass der Ex-Ehemann von Kim Kardashian (43) bei seinen Töchtern, die im Moment zehn und sechs Jahre alt sind, etwas derartiges zulassen würde. ""Das ist keine Liebe. Das ist Kontrolle"", soll die Meinung von Censoris Vater zur Partnerwahl seiner Tochter sein.

Kanye West arbore une tenue Decathlon en pleine période de Fashion Week parisienne,"Le rappeur américain fait de nouveau parler de lui pour avoir porté un ensemble de la marque française Decathlon en compagnie de sa petite amie Bianca Censori lors de la Fashion Week de Paris mercredi.
Cagoulé comme à son habitude, le rappeur américain Kanye West est sorti mercredi 28 février de son hôtel parisien au bras de sa compagne Bianca Censori, habillé d’une marque de sport complètement absente du calendrier de la Fashion Week. Vêtu d’un ensemble Décathlon, celui qui se surnomme désormais Ye portait une veste de pluie à bandes réfléchissantes, en vente sur le site de l’enseigne française à 90 euros, ainsi qu’un surpantalon à 45 euros, pensé pour protéger les jambes quand il pleut à vélo.
La marque française a rapidement réagi avec humour sur X avec le message ""Jul did it first"" (""Jul l’a fait en premier""). Le rappeur marseillais Jul a popularisé une veste de la marque Kalenji de Decathlon désormais surnommée Kalenjul par les jeunes des quartiers Nord de Marseille. Kanye West s’inscrit dans une dynamique des vêtements peu chers et populaires, lui qui est habitué à fréquenter les premiers rangs des défilés de haute couture comme Balenciaga.

Kanye West a de nouveau fustigé face aux reporters américains début février, la fin de son contrat entre sa marque Yeezy et le géant Adidas. ""J’étais le marketing, regardez où vous en êtes maintenant ! Ces marques comme Gap ou Balenciaga, ne veulent qu’utiliser votre image"", disait-il. Le rappeur a décidé d’utiliser la sienne pour récupérer le contrôle de sa marque Yeezy.
Sa nouvelle collection lancée il y a quelques semaines, ne comporte que des vêtements à 20 dollars, contre plusieurs centaines lorsque sa marque était associée à Adidas. Lors du dernier Superbowl, une publicité montrant Kanye West faisant la promotion de sa nouvelle collection lui a rapporté 19,3 millions de dollars en 24 h. Le rappeur s’en est félicité sur Instagram. En pleine promotion pour son nouvel album Vultures, Kanye West avait organisé une écoute géante à l’Accor Arena de Bercy en février.

Kanye West Leaks Adidas Memo Allegedly Conspiring Against Him,"Kanye West is not giving up in his battle with adidas to call out their business practices amid their new rollout of Yeezys. For those unaware, he claimed that this new initiative to sell the remaining sneaker inventory with new colorways emerged without his approval. Not only that, but Ye alleged that the company was still suing him for hundreds of millions of dollars and refusing to pay him. Now, he leaked an alleged adidas memo on Instagram on Thursday (February 29) that supposedly gives employees various ""talking points"" when it comes to their debacle. Specifically, it advises employees to ""please refrain from extended conversations"" about the clash and to emphasize the brand's sole ownership of Yeezy designs, proper licensing and process of upholding contract agreements, and the years-long completed state of these new designs.
""This is the document that they give employees at adidas when asked questions about Yeezy,"" Kanye West captioned the post. ""There is an overlap to adidas and Kim ignoring my opinion on where my kids go to school or people ignoring my name change or the entire celebrity culture ostracizing me for my political opinion. It all comes down to human rights which you sacrifice when you’re stigmatized with mental issues. All these situations are actually far cr*zier than what I’ve been branded to be.""

Furthermore, this news actually contrasts interestingly with the success of Ye's Ty Dolla $ign collab album Vultures. Apparently, their listening events in various U.S. and European cities netted them about $12 million across all shows, which presumably all sold out. Still, that doesn't change the antisemitic controversies, strained personal relationships, and combative business maneuvers that caused this adidas split. Kanye West is definitely making a valid point here, especially in terms of his mental condition, but it's muddied by his methods.
Meanwhile, with rumors of his solo album Y3 apparently not being as true as fans thought, who knows what he could do next? Two Vultures installments remain in Ye and Ty's release plans, and many song previews with no drop attached. As for adidas and Yeezy, it's very unclear how this situation could evolve in the future. With that in mind, check back in with HNHH for more news and the latest updates on Kanye West.

"Quem é Bianca Censori, mulher de Kanye West que viraliza ao andar quase em roupas","O nome de Kanye West tem aparecido na mídia não só por seus comentários antissemitas e machistas. O rapper também agora é creditado com frequência ao ser creditado como o marido de Bianca Censori, arquiteta australiana que vem andando seminua pelas ruas da semana de moda de Paris e posando da mesma forma no Instagram dele.
Crítica: Kanye West desperdiça talento com letras repletas de machismo e antissemitismo em novo álbum

Com frequência, Bianca é vista apenas com tecidos finos de meias-calça. Segundo o Daily Mail, inclusive, ela pode até receber um multa na França por isso, há que o artigo 222-32 do código penal local diz que a “exibição sexual deliberada à vista de terceiros em um local acessível ao olhar público é passível de punição com um ano de prisão e multa de 15 mil euros (aproximadamente 80 mil reais).
Quem é Bianca Censori?
Bianca Censori é uma arquiteta nascida e criada em Melbourne, na Austrália, que trabalha para a marca Yeezy, controlada por Kanye, desde 2020.
“Quando criança, passei muito tempo com minha tia, que sempre me expunha à arte, ao cinema e àarquitetura”, disse Bianca, em entrevista ao site “Hypebeast”. “Ela realmente impulsionou meu amor pelo design e incutiu em mim um olhar para a estética que fui capaz de nutrir até a idade adulta.”
Ela e o cantor foram visto juntos publicamente pela primeira vez em janeiro de 2023. Em outubro do ano passado, o jornal “Daily mail” obteve documentos mostrando que, em dezembro de 2022, Kanye e Bianca deram entrada nos documentos para o casamento, um mês mês depois da finalização do divórcio entre ele e Kim Kardashian. Depois das notícias do casamento, o Instagram dela foi desativado. A australiana tinha 16 mil seguidores na época, segundo o jornal britânico, e 27 postagens.
Kanye já lançou uma música com o nome da amada, chamada “Censori Overload”. Apesar de não dar detalhes sobre ela, o verso inicial fala: “E a Bíblia diz / Não posso mais fazer sexo / Até o casamento”.
A família da moça ficou feliz com o encontro entre ela e o americano. Na época do casamento, Angelina Censori, irmã de Bianca, foi ouvida pelo jornal “Herald Sun” e celebrou a união. “É uma notícia muito emocionante para minha irmã e para a família, mas optamos por ter um pouco de privacidade por enquanto.”",2024-03-01T17:05:30Z,https://www.mixvale.com.br,Portal Mix Vale
Promikolumne: Ist Bianca Censori Kanye Wests Nackt-Sklavin?,"Kanye West ist skandalumwoben. Seit Monaten macht das Enfant terrible der Musikszene mit bizarren Nackt-Auftritten mit seiner aktuellen Lebensgefährtin von sich reden. Will das Paar nur polarisieren? Oder muss Bianca Censori vor dem Rapper ""gerettet werden""? Ihr Vater sorgt sich sehr um seine Tochter und prangert West an.
Wer in Berlin wohnt, den haut so schnell nichts vom Hocker. Die Stadt, die niemals schläft, ist ein Eldorado für (Lebens-) Künstler, Kreative und jene, die sich dafür halten. Der Zeitgeist spiegelt sich natürlich auch in der Mode wider. Wer in Buxtehude als bunter Hund für Aufmerksamkeit sorgt, geht in Berlin regelrecht in der bunten Masse unter. Niemand schaut einen blöd von der Seite an, wenn man Lust darauf hat, mit einer Trockenhaube auf dem Haupt spazieren zu gehen. Den Berliner juckt es nicht, wie die Leute hier rumlaufen.
Irgendwann im Spätsommer vergangenen Jahres, ich war gerade in Berlin-Mitte unterwegs, stand ein skurriles Pärchen neben mir an der Ampel. Die Frau trug eine schwarze Sturmmaske und einen schwarzen Trenchcoat. Im Schlepptau - an einer Hundeleine - führte sie einen Mann mit sich. Es war ganz offensichtlich irgend so eine Fetisch-Nummer. Der Mann trug einen hässlichen Borat-Badeanzug und Trekkingsandalen. Über den Kopf hatte er eine Nylon-Strumpfhose gezogen, die am Mund ein Loch hatte. Als die Ampel auf Grün schaltete, begann der Mann zu bellen: ""Wau wau, wau wau wau.""
Früher galten exhibitionistisch veranlagte Menschen noch als Problembären für Sitte und Anstand. Heute muss man nur zwei Minuten auf Social Media gehen. Auffallen und polarisieren: Das sind mittlerweile gängige Skills, um sich ins Gespräch zu bringen. Je schräger oder nackter, desto besser.
Einer, der längst kapiert hat, dass auch schlechte Presse auf gewisse Art gut sein kann, ist der umstrittene Rapper Kanye West. Wir erinnern uns: Der exzentrische Musiker ist der Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian und sorgt seit Jahren für Skandale. Seien es seine damaligen Attacken gegen die US-Sängerin Taylor Swift oder seine unrühmlich beendete Zusammenarbeit mit dem Sportartikelhersteller Adidas: West als Enfant terrible zu bezeichnen, ist längst untertrieben.
""Das ist keine Liebe. Das ist Kontrolle""
Seine neuerlichen hochnotpeinlichen Auftritte mit seiner aktuellen Lebensabschnittsgefährtin Bianca Censori lassen sich jedenfalls nicht mit seiner Borderline-Erkrankung begründen. Immer mehr Beobachter des Paares fragen sich, ob der 46-Jährige die 29-Jährige, die in der Öffentlichkeit übrigens nie auch nur den leisesten Mucks von sich gibt, als Sexsklavin hält.
Mal sieht man Bianca Censori an Wests Seite halbnackt, dann wieder scheint sie eine durchsichtige Feinstrumpfhose mit einer Leggings zu verwechseln, unter der sie keine Unterwäsche trägt. Ein Höschen: des Öfteren Fehlanzeige. Nun könnte man derlei Unten-ohne-Spaziergänge mit einer gewissen Frischluft-Fanatik begründen. Möglicherweise ist es Bianca untenrum auch einfach nur warm, während sie obenrum friert. Denn durch Paris stiefelte sie kürzlich in Nylons ohne Schlüpfer, aber mit Pelzmantel.
Die öffentlichkeitswirksamen Auftritte der beiden muten von Mal zu Mal bizarrer an. In Berlin würde man sich fragen, ob sie auf dem Weg in den KitKatClub oder ins Berghain sind. Aber sie übertreiben ihren mutmaßlichen Fashion-Fetisch so dermaßen, dass sich nun sogar der Vater von Censori eingeschaltet hat und immer mehr Menschen voller Sorge auf diese Frau und ihr mutmaßlich toxisches Verhältnis zu West schauen.
Während Papa Leo Censori ob der Bilder seiner halbnackten Tochter auf der Palme ist, findet ein Bekannter der Familie deutliche Worte: ""Kein Mann sollte die Frau, die er liebt, jemals dazu ermutigen, in der Öffentlichkeit so aufzutreten und sich so zu präsentieren"", fasst der Insider die Meinung von Papa Censori zusammen. ""Das ist keine Liebe. Das ist Kontrolle.""
""Sie muss gerettet werden""
Auch immer mehr Fans fragen sich, ob Frau Censori freiwillig wie eine Sex-Trophäe unterwegs ist oder ob sie unter dem Einfluss ihres Partners steht. So mancher ist der Meinung: ""Sie muss gerettet werden."" Die Psychologin Carolyn Mair, die das Drama ebenfalls beobachtet, sagte gegenüber der britischen Zeitung ""The Sun"", West würde Censori ""entmenschlichen"". Die studierte Architektin wirkt an der Seite des Rappers in der Tat wie ein Objekt.
So war sie unlängst komplett nackt in einem Regencape unterwegs. Aus ihrem persönlichen Umfeld heißt es: ""Jeder in ihrem Leben will, dass sie ihn verlässt"". Den Vogel aber schoss das Paar in Venedig ab, wo man sie in einem Wassertaxi beim Oralsex fotografierte.
Sex im Freien mag in diversen Erotik-Heftchen aufregend und anrüchig zugleich klingen, tatsächlich aber ist es, wenn er derart dreist vor den Augen der anderen Touristen betrieben wird, Erregung öffentlichen Ärgernisses und kann sogar mit einer Freiheitsstrafe geahndet werden. Vielleicht keine schlechte Idee, mag so mancher jetzt denken. Denn ganz offensichtlich brennt Kanye West gehörig der Dachstuhl. Doch der Musiker und seine Nackt-Muse kamen mit einem blauen Auge davon: lebenslanges Fahrverbot vom Taxiunternehmen.
Auch die US-Schauspielerin Kathy Griffin hat eine Meinung zu den beschämenden Nackt-Auftritten: ""Ich sehe diese Frau, die keine Stimme und keine sozialen Medien hat. Wir haben keinen Piep von ihr gehört. Ich weiß nicht, ob er sie nicht reden lässt. (...) Als sie in Italien waren und er sie dazu brachte, auf die Knie zu fallen und ihm einen 'Dienst' zu erweisen, und wir seinen nackten Hintern sahen - wohl wissend, dass überall Paparazzi und Leute mit Handykameras herumstanden: Das riecht für mich einfach nach Missbrauch"".
Was also steckt hinter den bizarren Auftritten? Performance-Kunst? Ein Fetisch? Die Lust an der öffentlichen Fleischbeschau? West selbst soll ein Foto, das seine Lebensgefährtin halbnackt zeigt, mit den Worten kommentiert haben: ""Keine Hose dieses Jahr.""",2024-03-01T16:21:51Z,https://www.n-tv.de,n-tv NACHRICHTEN
"Kanye West Went After Kim Kardashian (Again), But Also Called Out His Terminated Contract With Adidas In The Process","Kanye West has been making headlines recently for many things outside of the scope of his latest album. On the heels of making news due to his current wife Bianca Censori's see-through leggings, he's been targeting his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, on social media this week. Kardashian was mentioned in one of Ye's latest social media posts, in which he also took aim at Adidas for a memo regarding his terminated contract.
In the latest saga between Adidas and Kanye West's lawsuits after the former terminated his contract for the Yeezy brand, the rapper posted an alleged internal memo that was reportedly sent by the company regarding how employees should respond to the ongoing situation. In the Instagram post, Ye went off on the company as well as Kim Kardashian and others that were tied into his life around the time of his anti-Semitism controversy and subsequent firing by major brands.
A post shared by Ye (@ye) A photo posted by on
Along with the memo, Ye sent a whole list of commentary regarding the situation, which also looped in Kim Kardashian. In his comment, Kanye West referred to the recent public post he made instructing his ex-wife to remove his children from their current school.
Ye's schooling post generated criticism from fans, but it seems his ex-wife has been on his mind a lot over the last several days, as his concern cropped up again in his latest post.
This is the document that they give employees at adidas when asked questions about Yeezy There is an overlap to adidas and Kim ignoring my opinion on where my kids go to school or people ignoring my name change or the entire celebrity culture ostracizing me for my political opinion It all comes down to human rights which you sacrifice when you’re stigmatized with mental issues All these situations are actually far crazier than what I’ve been branded to be.
The latter half of the caption touches on Kanye West's belief the world is stigmatizing him because of his past diagnosis of bipolar disorder. When they were married, Kim Kardashian spoke publicly about his diagnosis and empathizing but also struggling with it. West has denied he is bipolar in recent years, and as PageSix reported, texted tech mogul Elon Musk that he might have signs of autism instead.
One undeniable truth is that West has had little trouble getting caught up headline garnering situations lately. The rapper is currently in Europe with his wife, Bianca Censori, and promoting the release of his latest album, Vultures 1. Even the album hasn't escaped controversy, as Ozzy Osbourne wasn't happy to learn the rapper used a sample from Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" despite him denying his request to do so.

Kanye West diz ser 'ignorado' por Kim Kardashian e sofrer 'ostracismo' da mídia,"Kanye West, ou Ye, nome artístico que passou a adotar há alguns anos, publicou um desabafo nas redes sociais. Ele afirmou que é ignorado por Kim Kardashian, sua ex-mulher, com quem tem quatro filhos, e pela mídia.
""Kim não leva em consideração a minha opinião sobre onde meus filhos estudam. As pessoas ignoram a minha mudança de nome"", escreveu. O rapper afirmou ainda que foi condenado ao ostracismo pela cultura das celebridades como consequência de suas ""opiniões políticas"".
""Tudo se resume aos direitos humanos que você sacrifica quando é estigmatizado por problemas mentais."" O músico foi acusado mais de uma vez de ser antissemita por comentários a respeito do povo judeu.
Em 2018, ele afirmou que parou de tomar os remédios para controlar a bipolaridade porque a medicação o impedia de ser criativo no trabalho. No início de fevereiro, ele reuniu fãs em Nova York para lançar ""Vultures 1"", seu mais recente álbum.

The post, which has since accumulated widespread attention, sheds light on West’s perceived agitation regarding his relationship with his children and their education. In the now-deleted post, West blamed Sierra Canyon School for being a ""fake school for celebrities"" He wrote, ""Kim take my kids out of Sierra Canyon now. it's a fake school for celebrities that are used by 'the system'."" He captioned the post, ""At this point everybody knows what 'the system' is code word for. I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children.""

West’s post didn’t stop there; he went on to claim that only his two eldest children truly know him, highlighting a strained relationship with his younger offspring. He further added, ""When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate My two oldest know they daddy is."" The public outburst is just the latest in a series of controversial statements made by West regarding his family and personal life. Previously, during a live performance in Las Vegas, he touched upon issues surrounding his custody agreement with Kardashian and the limited access he feels he has to his children. Although he later apologized and exclaimed, “This is the mother of my children, and I apologize for any stress that I have caused, even in my frustration because God calls me to be stronger. But also, ain’t nobody else finna be causing no stress either. I need this person to be least stress, and of best sound mind, and as calm as possible to be able to raise those children.” as reported by HuffPost.

As per Mirror, the rapper’s remarks, both on social media and in public appearances, have ignited intense speculation and debate among fans. One fan wrote, “Why would you tell people where the kids go? Smh.” A second fan wrote, “You mean to tell me you don’t have her private number to discuss this ‘serious matter’ involving your kids? Or do you prefer to let the whole world know?”

Adrien Broner might be finally at peace with his separation from his girlfriend, Trea’Jure. Back in 2023, after the press conference of Terence Crawford and Errol Spence Jr, Broner got into trouble with his girlfriend when he repeatedly, on camera, asked a reporter for her number. He instantly realized his mistake and in a later interview said, “I got into it with my girl, Trea’Jure. I love you [and] I’m sorry… None of these b***hes got nothin’ on you.” Did she mind the slip-up?

Yes, she did. She took to Instagram to announce their breakup. She said, “Lmao [I don’t care] about that damn interview! Adrien is single ok… I hope he gets plenty numbers I’m rooting for him.” Well, now, Adrien Broner is shooting his shot, in his DMs, with none other than Kanye West‘s ex-wife Kim Kardashian.

Adrien Broner is known for his unique antics on social media. Broner always finds ways to grab the fans’ attention. It’s been almost 9 months since Broner stepped inside the ring against Bill Hutchinson, and still, during his hiatus, he knows how to make it to the headlines. Broner, who is currently enjoying his single life, posted a screenshot of his Instagram DM. He had texted Kim Kardashian, and wrote, “Let’s get in a relationship.” Unfortunately, he approached her on Sunday and still hasn’t received any text from Kardashian in response. In the caption, he wrote, “Had to shoot my shot i was wide open.”

The fans went wild after seeing the screenshot. Nobody had predicted such a step from ‘The Problem’, but then again, he has a tendency to surprise people through his unexpected actions. This is exactly what fans pointed out as well.
What would Kanye think?
The fans were incredulous that Broner had indeed texted Kardashian. Currently, she is in a relationship with Odell Beckham Jr., an NFL star wide receiver. Despite the widespread awareness that Broner didn’t stand a chance, he still pursued his interest.
One of the fans stated that he can easily be considered one of the most “undisciplined” fighters. They wrote, “Bro might be the most undisciplined fighter ever.”
Another fan talked about how Broner doesn’t hold a chance with Kardashian because he doesn’t have enough money. They wrote, “You ain’t got enough money bro chill.”
One fan joked that it seemed to them that this was posted by Kanye West. They wrote, “I thought this was a Kanye post.”

A fan was amazed by the idea of Broner and West going against each other. They wrote, “Imagine AB and Kanye beefing.”
An Instagram user had advice for the boxer and told him that he could do much better. They wrote, “You can do better than her AB.”

Bianca Censori : la femme de Kanye West se balade nue dans Paris,"Précedent Suivant
La Fashion Week de Paris est le moment où les personnalités osent les tenues les plus farfelues. Mais cette fois-ci, c’est le couple sulfureux formé par Kanye West et Bianca Censori qui a fait débat. En effet, les deux tourtereaux se trouvent actuellement dans la capitale pour assister à cet évènement. Comme à son habitude, la jeune femme était vêtue d’une tenue très provocante. Lors du retour d’un dîner au restaurant Ferdi de Paris, en début de semaine, Bianca, était vêtue d’un collant transparent dévoilant sa vulve et son arrière-train. Elle a seulement agrémenté sa tenue avec un manteau en fourrure semblant masquer le haut de son corps. Une tenue qui a choqué de nombreuses personnes sur la toile…
Bianca Censori ose des tenues très provocantes
Et pour cause, la vedette australienne n’en est pas à coup d’essai. En effet, elle avait déjà provoqué une polémique en début de semaine en s’affichant sans pantalon au cours d’une visite dans une boutique avec Kanye West. Le style très provocant de Bianca continue de susciter l’indignation du public notamment dans les lieux publics. Selon le Daily Mail, Kim Kardashian, l’ex du rappeur et mère de ses enfants, ne veut pas que la jeune femme s’habille ainsi devant ses bambins. Kim aurait même demandé à Bianca de se montrer plus discrète surtout en présence de North, Chicago, Saint et Psalm.

Le couple reste soudé face aux critiques
Pour rappel, Bianca Censori avait déjà choqué les habitants de Florence en Italie en 2023 en se baladant dans les rues de la ville avec un soutien-gorge quasi transparent. Et ce n’est pas tout. Le couple avait aussi été surpris à Venise dans une position jugée obscène et en train de s’enlacer langoureusement à la vue de tous. Si les critiques vont bon train sur le couple, Kanye West et Bianca Censori ne veulent pas se laisser influencer. En effet, le couple continue de faire sensation avec son style distinctif. D’ailleurs, ils attirent toujours l’attention où ils se trouvent. Les amoureux ne cessent de repousser les limites et de faire parler d’eux avec leurs choix vestimentaires audacieux.

Bianca Censori sous l’emprise de Kanye West ?
Pour les amis de la jeune femme, Kanye West aurait toutefois une emprise toxique sur elle. Le contrôle du rappeur s’exercerait jusqu’à son régime alimentaire. « On l’oblige à manger certains aliments en particulier. On lui autorise un régime à base de kebabs, de glaces, et de jus de pastèque, qui est un afrodisiaque », a confié une source au Daily Mail. L’inquiétude grandit auprès de ses amis car Bianca Censori serait contrainte au silence : « Tous sont très inquiets. Ce n’est pas elle. C’est une personne incroyablement franche et vivante, elle n’est pas du genre à la boucler.

‘Ha rubato I Feel Love’: eredi Donna Summer vs Kanye West,"Kanye West fa arrabbiare gli eredi di Donna Summer. Secondo un'azione legale, il rapper è accusato di aver rubato ‘I Feel Love’, hit del 1977 della defunta cantautrice statunitense. Il brano in questione è ‘Good (Don't Die)’, in collaborazione con Ty Dolla $ign. Bruce Sudano, vedovo di Donna Summer, sostiene che più volte al rapper è stato negato l'utilizzo della canzone. Di fronte all'ennesimo ‘No’, i due artisti hanno deciso di aggirare i rifiuti attraverso quello che è definito ‘interpolation’ senza autorizzazione.
""Di fronte ai ripetuti rifiuti – si legge nei documenti legali –, West e il suo coimputato hanno cercato di aggirare il blocco attraverso un interpolation non autorizzato. Hanno usato la melodia della canzone come motivo per la loro canzone violante e, sostanzialmente, hanno registrato nuovamente alla lettera la tonalità. Parti di ‘I Feel Love’ sono riconoscibili all'istante con l'utilizzo di una cantante che ha la voce simile a quella di Summer. Sono stati fatti anche dei sottili cambiamenti al testo, ugualmente senza autorizzazione"". West non ha commentato a riguardo.",2024-03-01T10:24:17Z,https://www.laregione.ch,LaRegione Ticino
"Kim Kardashian, enfadada porque Kanye West le haya pedido por redes que borre a sus hijos del colegio: ""Es utilizado por el sistema""","""Kim, saca a mis hijos de Sierra Canyon [un colegio privado de California], porque hoy por hoy es una falsa escuela para celebridades que son utilizadas por 'el sistema'"", escribió en redes este jueves Kanye West. No fue lo único, pero Kim Kardashian, según fuentes cercanas, está muy molesta con su exmarido por este ataque público a su forma de educar a los cuatro hijos que tuvo con el rapero y por hacer público donde asisten, con el subsiguiente problema de seguridad.
""A estas alturas todo el mundo sabe cuál es la palabra clave para 'el sistema'. El sistema me separó de mi padre y el sistema me separó de mis hijos. Cuando el sistema recluta atletas, lo hacen evitando trabajar con aquellos que tienen a su padre en su vida porque son más difíciles de manipular. Mis dos hijos mayores saben que su padre estará ahí"", añadió el músico, en referencia a North y Saint.
Pero la empresaria y socialite se ha cansado de estos comentarios impertinentes. Según fuentes cercanas, está ""frustrada"" porque no consigue que Ye deje fuera de las redes sociales los problemas que puedan tener sobre la educación de los pequeños, todos menores de edad: North, 10 años, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6 y Psalm, 4.
Según una fuente cercana, si Kim inscribió a sus hijos en la escuela privada Sierra Canyon, en Los Ángeles, es porque se trata de un ""colegio fantástico"", así como siente que sus hijos necesitan ""una consistencia"" entre quienes son sus amigos, sus maestros y la comunidad en la que viven.
Añade este informante en declaraciones a Page Six que ""Kim nunca ha alejado a los niños de su padre"", pero sí que ha sido el propio rapero quien ""apenas está presente"" en su educación y en sus vidas y que puede pasar varios meses sin ver a sus hijos bajo el pretexto de un estilo de vida nómada que West lleva a cabo su esposa, Bianca Censori.
Según la fuente, los pequeños tendrían que dejar el colegio y viajar en avión para estar con su padre, no más que algunas horas dondequiera que esté fuera del país. ""Como [Kanye] no tiene una base de operaciones fija, se enfatiza la importancia de la coherencia de que los niños estudien en Los Ángeles, donde viven. Kim siempre se va a mostrar inflexible en lo que es mejor para ellos"", ha añadido.
Por si fuera poco, la opción que plantea Kanye es que vuelvan a Donda Academy, su ""escuela no acreditada, que ha sido plagada de demandas"" y que tuvo que cerrar —Kim al comienzo permitió que sis hijos asistieran para actividades extraescolares—.""Kanye no cree en la educación estándar en general y les ha dicho a sus hijos que ir a la escuela no es necesario"", ha declarado la fuente.
Dicho informante ha finalizado: ""El deseo de Kim es que esto sea un asunto privado y que Kanye no siga cogiendo sus quejas y haciendo de ellas asuntos públicos en redes sociales. Porque no debería haber problemas, sino que es él quien se los inventa"".",2024-03-01T09:45:51Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos

Bianca Censori’s father wants to confront Kanye West over fears he is tearing his daughter away from her family and turning her into a “trashy commodity,” according to a report.
Leo Censori, whose brother is a notorious gangland killer, has reportedly expressed interest in sitting down with the rapper to speak about his recent behavior, sources told Daily Mail.
“Bianca’s father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” a source close to Bianca told the outlet.

“He wants to ask Kanye what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.”
“He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife,” they added.
In recent months, the 29-year-old former architect has been seen out and about while wearing little to no clothing, with outrageous outfits ranging from sheer tops and tights, to going completely commando in public.
Insiders told the outlet that Leo and his family believe that the “Jesus Walks” hitmaker has ripped Biaca apart from her family.

“If this isn’t bad enough, the man who is supposed to protect Mr. and Mrs. Censori’s daughter is the same man that is shutting her out from her own family,” the source said.
“Leo honestly wants to just sit Kanye down to let him know that he is hurting her family by turning his beloved daughter into a trashy-looking marketable commodity.”

The source suggested that Bianca is not calling the shots herself when it comes to her style choices.
“No man should ever encourage the woman that he loves to walk out in public and present herself like this. That isn’t love. That is control,” the insider added.
Page Six has reached out to West’s reps for comment.

Bianca’s father had previously served five years in prison after being convicted of possessing a prohibited Class A drug in 1982, the Daily Mail reported.

What’s more, his brother Eris Censori — dubbed “Melbourne’s Al Capone” –was previously sentenced to death for murder.
His sentence was later commuted to life in prison, the Herald Sun reported.

Leo’s concerns echo a similar sentiment expressed by Bianca’s pals in January, who claimed that the rapper had banned her from using social media for her own “protection.”
The “All Falls Down” rapper is said to be keeping Bianca from interacting with others on social media platforms in a bid to avoid negative comments, however, sources close to the pair told Daily Mail it’s a way of further “isolating” her from reality.

Kim Kardashian verärgert über Kanyes öffentliche Angriffe!,"Das kommt für sie wohl nicht infrage! Kim Kardashian (43) und Kanye West (46) haben vier gemeinsame Kinder: North (10), Saint (8), Chicago (6) und Psalm (4). Die Promi-Sprösslinge wohnen bei der Mutter, haben aber zu ihrem Vater regelmäßigen Kontakt. Der würde in der Erziehung gerne einiges ändern – kürzlich forderte der umstrittene Rapper mit einem Social-Media-Post auf, dass seine Ex-Frau den gemeinsamen Nachwuchs von der aktuellen Schule nehmen soll. Kim gefällt Kanyes Art und Weise wohl überhaupt nicht!
Wie TMZ berichtet, plaudert nun ein Insider über die Gefühlslage der Mehrfachmama. Die TV-Berühmtheit habe ihre Schützlinge bei der Institution angemeldet, weil diese als ""fantastische Schule"" bekannt sei und ""ihre Kinder Beständigkeit in ihrem Leben brauchen"". Über Kanyes Posting sei die Unternehmerin nicht erfreut – und über seinen Lösungsvorschlag wohl auch nicht. Er habe vorgeschlagen, die Kids bei ""seiner eigenen, nicht akkreditierten Donda-Schule unterzubringen"".
Vor ein paar Wochen spekulierten die Fans noch über eine Versöhnung der Geschiedenen. Kim und Kanye hatten sich zusammen mit ihren vier Kindern zu einem Familienessen in Los Angeles versammelt – das friedliche Verhältnis zwischen den Eltern hielt aber scheinbar nicht lange an.

Kanye West în război cu adidas,"International Kanye West, în război cu o companie de articole sportive. Câți bani îi cere compania cântărețului
Problemele par să nu se mai termine pentru celebrul Kanye West. Cântărețul spune că una dintre companiile care avea contract cu el vrea să îl dea în judecată și să îi ceară 250 de milioane de dolari.
Kanye West e foc de supărat după ce ar fi aflat că una dintre companiile care avea contract cu el vrea să îl dea în judecată. Suma pe care această companie ar cere-o de la artist ar fi de 250 de milioane de dolari. Conflictul dintre firmă și Kanye a izbucnit în momentul în care artistul a făcut declarații antisemite.
Asta deși colaborarea cu Adidas a dus la apariția liniei în care s-a colaborat a fost un real succes. „Primul model de pantofi a fost lansat în februarie 2015. În 2020, Forbes a descris ascensiunea acestuia drept „una dintre marile povești de retail ale secolului”.
Parteneriatul lui Kanye a fost extrem de profitabil
Parteneriatul dintre companie și Kanye nu a fost doar foarte popular printre pasionații de sport și printre fanii lui West, a fost și incredibil de profitabil și pentru ambele părți.
Astfel, linia a fost evaluată la între 3,2 și 4,7 miliarde de dolari de către banca de investiții UBS. Colaborarea dintre giganți reprezintă aproximativ 1 miliard de dolari până la 2 miliarde de dolari în vânzări anuale pentru compania în cauză.
Doar că ieșirile publice ale lui Kanye au pus stop acestei colaborări. „Se așteaptă ca acest lucru să aibă un impact negativ pe termen scurt de până la 250 de milioane de euro”. Spuneau atunci cei de la companie.
Artistul a avut o ieșire nervoasă
Kanye a avut o ieșire publică zilele acestea legat de acest subiect. „Permiteți-mi să vă explic foarte clar, băieți, ce se întâmplă cu această companie. Nu numai că lansează culori false care nu sunt aprobate, ci mă dau în judecată pentru 250 de milioane de dolari.
Și nici nu mă plătesc pentru acești pantofi”, a spus Kanye. Ba mai mult artistul îi încurajează pe fanii lui să nu mai cumpere din stocul rămas din linia cu pricina. Compania nici nu a confirmat nici nu a infirmat afirmațiile lui Kanye până acum.",2024-03-01T05:20:36Z,https://evz.ro,EVENIMENTUL ZILEI
Here's Why Kanye West Decided to Shut Down His Social Media Accounts Amid 'Bullying' Claims,"Kanye West is a renowned rapper whose skills remain unique and unmatched to date Despite his fame and fortune, he’s been a part of many controversies resulting in the annulment of several major brands such as Adidas due to his anti-semitic comments. Furthermore, he’s also deactivated his accounts on social media and activated them numerous times in the past. Looks like history might repeat itself after a newly deleted rant on Instagram. West claimed that he was being bullied and was hence closing down his various accounts on social media.

According to The U.S Sun, the American Boy rapper shared a rather daunting message about deleting his accounts on the aforementioned platform through a furious rant. The Yeezy founder discussed a range of different topics that have seemingly irked him over the years. Although it was deleted, snaps of the video were shared on X, formerly Twitter.

West primarily talked about shutting down his social media activity after people refused to address him by his new name: Ye. The tweet read: “Ye said he is closing down his “Kanye West” IG account since changing his legal name.” The user added, “He said that anyone who calls him “Kanye West” is calling him out of his name.”
It HAS to be YE??? Okay I guess? — Rot (@Cameron94253944) February 28, 2024
The tweet featured a screenshot of West’s alleged conversation with famous motivational speaker, Justin LaBoy. Apart from mentioning the aforementioned announcement, West explained his reason. He said, “No brand or numbers gonna force me to call myself what they want to still be.” In another screenshot, West’s comments from the Meta platform featuring something he wrote were also shared.
The snippet read: “Somebody has Ye as an account. I would like to have my name so I can change my account to my legal name.” West added, “Nobody finna bully nothing.” He issued a final remark or rather explanation that echoed the previously mentioned note to LaBoy.

It read: “My name is Ye now. You call me Kanye West, you calling me out of my name. Name big changed to Ye on Insta shortly.” From the looks of things, West seemed rather ticked off over his name and might even do what he claims: change his name on Instagram and legally.

Well, it looks like it happened because West seemed to have completely re-created his Instagram feed. Initially, it included several pictures of his wife Bianca Censori, and their time together. Furthermore, it included a few rants about him defending her because of the backlash she’s received over her risque ensembles.
Presently, he’s only retained the video of his beloved album Vultures and the song, Talking. The song features his daughter North West, whom he shares with his ex-wife Kim Kardashian.

Additionally, the need for stability and routine for their children amidst the public scrutiny surrounding their family played a significant role in Kim's decision-making process. For Kim Kardashian, the welfare and well-being of her children remain paramount. Kanye's public declarations regarding their children's schooling not only undermine her choices but also raise concerns about the impact of such exposure on their kids. The couple shares four children – North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. Ensuring a nurturing environment for them is of utmost importance to both parents.
This incident underscores a broader issue faced by many high-profile families. There's a delicate balance between privacy and public disclosure, especially when it comes to matters involving children. While Kim and Kanye have often lived their lives under the spotlight, their children deserve protection from unnecessary public scrutiny and discord. It's evident that Kim Kardashian is navigating a challenging situation with grace and concern for her children's well-being. As the saga unfolds, one can only hope that the couple can find common ground and prioritize their children's needs above all else.

"North West Arrives LA With Designer Goodies, Following Paris Vacation With Dad Kanye West","North West, daughter and the eldest among four kids of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, recently made headlines as she jetted back home to Los Angeles aboard a private jet after a memorable performance with her father in Paris. Accompanied by her nanny and a bodyguard, North arrived in Los Angeles with bags from luxury fashion houses Chanel and Celine, showcasing her high-end lifestyle per TMZ.

During her recent trip to Paris, North joined her father, Kanye, and his wife Bianca Censori, at an event in the Accor Arena. The ten-year-old made a captivating on-stage appearance during Kanye's performance to promote Vultures Volume 1. As the West family wraps up a successful week, all 16 tracks from Kanye and Ty Dolla Sign's album Vultures 1, featuring North on the song Talking, have achieved placement on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. North's active participation in both live performances and studio recordings reflects her enduring passion and growing commitment to following in her father's footsteps.

Nevertheless, amidst the family's jubilations, the spotlight is cast on the environmental ramifications linked to private jet travel, a favored luxury among celebrities. While North's presence on stage and in the music video for Talking/Once Again adds to the family's achievements, it also raises awareness of the carbon footprint associated with such extravagant travel. In addition to her musical involvement, North and her stepmother Bianca were seen enjoying leisurely outings in Paris, indulging in visits to popular fast-food chains like Popeyes and McDonald's.

However, sometime back West expressed his displeasure when his daughter was raging with fame over TikTok. A deleted TikTok post from their daughter North, featuring a drawing of Bianca in a controversial outfit, sparked debate among followers of the joint @kimandnorth account, managed by Kim herself. This incident highlights the challenges of managing public perceptions and preserving familial harmony while in the public eye. Previously, North showcased her impressive vocal range and rap skills in her father West's music video for ""Talking."" Despite her young age, she has proven to be incredibly talented and confident in expressing herself. On the other hand, a recent post on the mum and daughter's joint TikTok account, featuring a snapshot of Kardashian's bare face, sparked speculation among fans about possible cosmetic procedures.

While the post was swiftly removed, it sparked renewed speculation about Kardashian's rumored cosmetic procedures. North's caption, ""Photo Dump,"" hints that the intention behind the now-deleted images was to share candid snapshots but inadvertently sparked controversy instead. Upon closer observation, at the bottom right of the screen, West sported a comical expression, eliciting a surprised reaction. Amid persistent speculation from online commentators about the reality star's rumored cosmetic enhancements, she has opted not to address the topic publicly. However, according to a report by People last year, during an episode of her popular show, Kardashian made a comment about Botox in her neck.",2024-03-01T01:45:02Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign ""Vultures 1"" Listening Party Earnings Revealed","It's no secret that the rollout of Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign's joint album, Vultures 1, was major. After months of delays and teasing, the duo unleashed the album in full earlier this month. The release came just after their short-notice listening party in Ye's hometown of Chicago.
Following the release, they went on to host listening events in New York, Miami, and more. The pair even hosted various subsequent events in Europe, reportedly selling out arenas in Bologna, Milan, and Paris. Of course, this is bound to raise questions about how much dough they managed to rake in through the events. According to Billboard's recent estimates, the number is pretty impressive.

The outlet reports that Ye and Ty's listening parties in New York and Chicago each brought in about $2.4 million in ticket sales. Sales figures for the European events were unavailable at the time of writing, but tickets were going for similar prices overseas as they were in the U.S., between $140-$220. As all shows are believed to have sold out, this brings the gross total to more than a whopping $12 million.
It doesn't look like Ye and Ty Dolla Sign plan on slowing down anytime soon, either. Rumors that Ye will embark on a world tour sometime in the near future are brewing, and the second installment of Vultures is only days away. Vultures 2 is currently expected to drop on March 8 of this year. This will later be followed by the release of the project's third installment, presumably dubbed Vultures 3, on April 5. What do you think of Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign's Vultures 1 listening parties bringing in an estimated total of over $12 million? Are you surprised?

Kim Kardashian 'fears for her kids' safety' after Kanye West's 'public attacks' and demand to take them out of school,"KIM Kardashian has expressed her concerns for her four children after her ex-husband Kanye West's latest online rant.
The rap music star took to Instagram to publically reveal that he wanted his children: North, 10, Saint, eight, Chicago, six, and Psalm, five, taken out of the school they attend.

On Wednesday night, Kanye, 46, shared a post on his social media account slamming Kim, 43, calling it the ""fake school for celebrities that are used by 'the system.'""
In another comment, the Flashing Lights hitmaker continued, ""At this point, everybody knows what 'the system' is code for. I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children.
""When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate. My two oldest know who they daddy is,"" he concluded.
UPSET KIM
Sources recently revealed to TMZ that Kim isn't happy with her ex's latest comments and wishes to solve the issues he has privately.
The insider revealed that Kim enrolled her children at their school because it's ""fantastic"" and they need consistency in their lives.
They said, ""The only solution Kanye has offered in protest to the school - that the kids have been at since pre-school - has been placing them with unaccredited teachers and his own unaccredited Donda school which has been riddled with lawsuits.""
The insider continued, ""Kim is frustrated with his constant public attacks and naming of the school because it creates safety and security concerns each and every time for their children.""
The news outlet also revealed that Kanye agreed to settle matters privately after he signed their divorce settlement, but continues to break those rules.
While Kanye publicly made a demand of his ex-wife, Kim privately set her own rules for the rapper.
HER RULES
Kanye's new wife, Bianca Censori, 29, has become known for her very revealing outfits, and Kim has reportedly put her foot down.
Earlier this month, a source told The Daily Mail that Kim demanded that Bianca cover up around her and Kanye's children.

""Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids,"" the source said to the Daily Mail.
""She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.""
The demands came soon after her eldest daughter doodled a naked drawing of her stepmother.
Kim shared a photo of her daughter's notebook, where North had written several things she was grateful for that day.
Underneath, she listed several things about her father's album, including one of his songs, Carnival, along with a sketch of Bianca wearing just a tiny thong on the album cover.
ANOTHER RANT
Kanye shared his opinion from his new social media account, after announcing that he was deleting his old one during a hastily-deleted rant on Wednesday.
In one screenshot of a conversation with motivational speaker Justin LaBoy, he announced, ""I'm closing my Kanye West Instagram account. My name is Ye. No brand or numbers gonna force me to call myself what they want me to still be.""
In a second post, a screenshot of Instagram comments made by the Donda rapper read, ""Somebody has Ye as an account.
""I would like to have my name so I can change my account to my legal name. Nobody finna bully nothing.
""My name is Ye now. You call me Kanye West you calling me out of my name. Name big changed to Ye on Insta shortly,"" he concluded.
In 2018, Kanye revealed he was going by Ye following the release of his Ye album, with the star confirmed to have changed his name legally in 2021.

Pai de Bianca Censori quer confrontar Kanye West,"Bianca Censori / Reprodução / Instagram
A família de Bianca Censori ficou mais preocupada ainda com a filha, depois dela ser fotografada saindo sem calcinha, usando somente uma meia-calça e um casaco curto de pele, que deixava à mostra sua genitália.
Esposa de Kanye West faz plantão como madrasta
Enquanto os parisienses chocados pedem que a mulher de Kanye West seja presa por sair à rua sem roupa íntima, com tudo de fora, o pai da arquiteta australiana quer confrontar o genro.
Segundo o jornal “Daily Mail”, Leo Censori, ficou chocado com as imagens e acha que o rapper foi longe demais, expondo a filha desta maneira, ‘como se fosse um troféu nu e inútil’.
O homem, que é irmão de um assassino de gangues de acordo com a publicação, está sofrendo junto com a família de Bianca, pelo que ela pode estar vivendo ao lado do ex de Kim Kardashian.

Confronto
“O pai de Bianca, Leo, quer ter uma conversa adequada com Kanye e perguntar o que diabos ele está pensando quando desfila com Bianca como um troféu nu e inútil”, disse o informante.
Kim Kardashian reclama da pouca roupa da mulher de Kanye West
“Ele quer perguntar a Kanye o que ele faria se suas filhas North, ou Chicago, fossem vistas em público seminuas em trajes incentivados por seus maridos…”
“Leo sabe que não há nenhuma maneira de Kanye permitir isso para suas filhas, então não faz sentido porque ele encorajaria isso para sua própria esposa.”
Kanye, que se casou com Bianca em uma cerimônia privada em dezembro de 2022, também foi acusado de ‘distanciá-la’ de sua família na Austrália.
“Se isso não for ruim o suficiente, o homem que deveria proteger a filha do Sr. e da Sra. Censori é o mesmo homem que a está distanciando de sua própria família”, continuou a fonte.
Kim Kardashian recusa pedido de Kanye West
“Honestamente Leo quer apenas sentar com Kanye para que ele saiba que ele está prejudicando a família dela ao transformar sua amada filha em uma mercadoria comercializável de aparência inútil”, disse.
A fonte concluiu: “Nenhum homem deveria encorajar a mulher que ele ama a sair em público e se apresentar assim. Isso não é amor. Isso é controle.”
Condenado
E o diário britânico descobriu quem é Leo Censori, pai de Bianca. Anteriormente o homem cumpriu pena de prisão depois de ser condenado sob a acusação de ‘posse de uma importação proibida (heroína)’ em 1982 – um crime que o levou a ficar cinco anos atrás das grades.

Além do tráfico de heroína, Leo também tem condenações por porte de pistola e munição.
Leo também é irmão de Eris Censori – um notório assassino de gangues que já foi apelidado de ‘Al Capone de Melbourne’.
Ele foi condenado à morte por assassinato, embora essa sentença tenha sido posteriormente comutada para prisão perpétua.
Segundo o “Daily Mail”, expor a genitália em público pode causar problemas para Bianca.
O artigo 222-32 do novo código penal francês (aplicável desde 1 de Março de 1994) estipula:
“A exibição sexual deliberada à vista de terceiros num local acessível ao olhar público é punível com um ano de prisão e multa de cem mil francos. [15.000€]”.",2024-02-29T23:00:00Z,https://www.ofuxico.com.br,OFuxico
Bianca Censori Dons Sheer Top For NSFW Paris Outing With Kanye West,"Another day, another risqué outfit for Bianca Censori, who recently popped out for a Parisian dinner with her husband Kanye West. Moreover, on Wednesday night (February 28), they hit up a restaurant in the City of Love, and she wore a very revealing sheer top that exposes her breasts quite openly. In fact, the former Yeezy architect's entire outfit was pretty see-through, and with this lack of self-consciousness in mind, she snuggled up quite closely with the Chicago artist at the eatery. Regardless of what you think of these fashion choices and antics, it's clear that they definitely captivated a lot of style critics online.
Furthermore, this also comes amid odd timing, as Kanye West recently called out Kim Kardashian for keeping their kids at a ""fake school."" Given the more lewd and inappropriate displays around his life, including Bianca Censori and all the sexual content that he either shares or indulges in lyrically, it's a bit of a bizarre standard to uphold. After all, Ye's issues with his ex-wife's parenting don't seem paired with a more traditional or, again, self-conscious set of family values. Unfortunately for everyone involved, it's probably not going to be a resolved question for a long time.

Elsewhere, Kanye West and Bianca Censori are also showing their relationship dynamics by rallying together against big corporations... as wild as that sounds. For example, they recently prompted concertgoers at the 46-year-old's Vultures listening event in Paris to chant ""F**k Adidas."" This comes amid reports that the company will sell their remaining Yeezy inventory and roll out new colorways, which the ""BURN"" MC obviously took issue with. However, it doesn't seem like this overt disapproval will halt the company from proceeding with their initiative.
Meanwhile, Censori also intervened in Adin Ross' assessment of her husband's situation. What's more is that the streamer even apologized for speaking on him and his financial struggles, which is heartening to see without the context of all of Ye's antisemitism. Even if it may be a misguided effort, it's always at least a little bit nice to see a couple stand up for each other. You can find pictures of this revealing Paris fit in the ""Via"" link down below.

She’s had enough.
A “frustrated” Kim Kardashian wants her ex-husband Kanye West to keep the issues he has about their four minor children off social media after he took to Instagram and begged her to take their kids out of a “fake” school for celebrities.
A source close to the situation tells Page Six that the Skims founder enrolled their children — North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4 — at the Sierra Canyon private school in Los Angeles because it’s a “fantastic school” and their kids need “consistency” among their friends, teachers and community.

“Kim has never kept the kids from their dad,” the insider says, adding that the “Donda” rapper is “hardly around” and can go months without seeing his kids.
Due to the nomadic lifestyle West, 46, has been living with his wife, Bianca Censori, the source tells us that the children would have to be pulled out of school and travel via plane to be with their father wherever he is overseas.
“[West] does not have a consistent home base, which emphasizes the importance of consistency for the kids in LA where they live. She will always stand firm on what is best for them,” the insider tells us.

As far as the kids’ education goes, the source tells us that the Grammy winner believes the kids should be placed with “unaccredited teachers” in his “unaccredited Donda school, which has been riddled with lawsuits.”
The insider notes that Kardashian, 43, previously allowed the children to attend Donda for after-school activities but stopped once the school shut down.
“Kanye doesn’t believe in standardized education in general and has told his kids that going to school is not necessary,” the source adds.

We’re told that Kardashian is “frustrated with his constant public attacks and naming of the school” by her ex because it “creates security and safety concerns each and every time for their children.”

“There should be no issues,” our source adds. “He makes them up.”

Kanye West's 'Vultures' Listening Parties Made $12 Million,"Kanye West’s short but lucrative five-show run of listening parties for his Vultures 1 album with Ty Dolla $ign generated more than $12 million in ticket sales, Billboard estimates based on available data.
West’s first two listening events in the United States — Feb. 8 at United Center in Chicago and Feb. 9 at UBS Arena in New York — each generated approximately $2.4 million in ticket sales. While sales figures for the three listening party events in Europe — Feb. 22 at Milan Arena; Feb. 24 at Unipol Arena in Bologna, Italy; and Feb. 25 at Accor Arena in Paris — were unavailable, tickets were priced similarly to the U.S. shows, selling for between $140 to $220. All shows are believed to have sold out.
Sources tell Billboard that the U.S. shows were produced by Jam Concerts out of Chicago and that West originally requested a unique setup: Instead of appearing on a stage, he and Ty Dolla $ign wanted to appear at the listening party atop a massive pile of sand.
Trending on Billboard
According to one source who viewed the technical rider for the show, West wanted crews to drop a five-foot-high, 35×35-foot pile of sand in the center of the arena to serve as the stage. When it was pointed out that sand would not be able to safely hold the stage’s speaker monitors in place, the plan was scrapped. At the United States shows, Jam crew members instead built a more traditional center stage with ramps on four sides that West, Ty Dolla $ign and other guests could use to enter and exit.
A source close to both U.S. shows said the timeline for the gigs was rushed: Both the Chicago and New York events were held just 72 hours after being announced.
Billboard reached out to Jam Productions and West’s booking agent, Cara Lewis, for comment but did not receive a response by press time.",2024-02-29T20:26:18Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Netflix’s Kanye West Movie Didn’t Defame Dancing Woman, Judge Says","A woman who once appeared “obviously intoxicated” in a Kanye West music video cannot sue for defamation after the footage was used in the Kanye-focused Netflix documentary jeen-yuhs, a federal judge says, even if she later got sober and “turned her life around.”
Cynthia Love sued last year, claiming jeen-yuhs filmmakers Coodie Simmons and Chike Ozah defamed her by including the footage in the 2022 Netflix series. The clip, which showed Love dancing and slurring her words at a Chicago barbecue spot, was originally shot for the 2003 music video for Kanye West’s debut single, “Through The Wire.”
Love’s argument was unusual. She admitted that the footage was authentic — normally the death knell for a libel lawsuit. But she argued that because she had later gotten sober, it had become false and defamatory to use it in the present day.
Trending on Billboard
In a ruling Tuesday (Feb. 27), Judge Steven Seeger sharply rejected that argument, ruling that the footage was “historically accurate” and shows a “a past truth,” even if it was a truth that Love did not want to remember.
“Holding up a mirror isn’t defamation. Holding up a 20-year-old picture isn’t defamation, either,” the judge wrote. “They both reflect reality, like it or not.”
It did not matter that Love had later “turned things around,” the judge wrote, or that the Netflix doc depicts her at her “darkest moments” years ago: “The ‘Jeen-yuhs’ video accurately portrays Love in a moment of time several decades ago. The video does not suggest that Love remains in an intoxicated state, or anything of that sort.”
Directed by Coodie & Chike (the moniker used by the filmmakers), jeen-yuhs depicted West’s career through unreleased archival footage, much of it filmed by Coodie over decades of working with the rapper. After landing at Netflix for a reported $30 million, the series was released in February 2022 — just months before West would receive widespread condemnation for a string of antisemitic statements.
Years earlier, Love had briefly appeared in the “Through The Wire” video, which was directed by Coodie & Chike in one of their first projects. The video showed Love drunkenly dancing in Chicago eater Original Leon’s Bar-B-Q. That footage, plus additional unused footage showing her interacting with West, later appeared in jeen-yuhs, making up about two minutes of footage total across two episodes.
Love sued last year, accusing Coodie & Chike and Netflix of defamation and a wide range of other wrongdoing. (West was not named or accused of any wrongdoing). She claimed they had “recklessly disregarded the truth” that she had made “an amazing transformation” since the ugly footage was filmed, hurting her reputation among present-day peers: “Neighbors, co-workers, and family cannot help but view and treat her as someone less worthy of their respect, esteem and trust,” her lawyers wrote.
But in Tuesday’s order dismissing those allegations, Judge Seeger pointedly noted that “sometimes the truth hurts, and when the truth hurts, it isn’t defamation.” Summarizing her argument as “the footage was true then, but it isn’t true now,” the judge told her that’s simply not how defamation law works.
“Plain and simple, any allegations about Love in the ‘Jeen-yuhs’ docuseries are true,” the judge wrote. “The docuseries includes real-world clips of Love, without doctoring the content or adding any false material. It shows true clips of a real event.”
Attorneys for both sides did not immediately return a request for comment.",2024-02-29T19:52:12Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Jack Antonoff Defends Taylor Swift's Songwriting, Slams Kanye West","Jack Antonoff has no time for anyone interested in slandering Taylor Swift‘s abilities as a songwriter. The Grammy-winning producer and longtime Swift collaborator recently told the Los Angeles Times that questioning Swift’s songwriting “is like challenging someone’s faith in God. You just don’t go there.”
“I’m a little bitch sometimes,” he added. “But you come after my friend Taylor, you’re toast to me.”
Blur and Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn ignited outrage among Swift fans in 2022 after he told the LA Times that Swift “doesn’t write her own songs.”
“A really interesting songwriter is Billie Eilish and her brother,” he added at the time. “I’m more attracted to that than to Taylor Swift. It’s just darker — less endlessly upbeat. Way more minor and odd. I think she’s exceptional.”
Albarn’s diss prompted Antonoff to take to Twitter at the time to post: “I’ve never met Damon Albarn and he’s never been to my studio but apparently he knows more than the rest of us about all those songs Taylor writes and brings in. Herb.”
In his new LA Times interview, Antonoff also hit out at one of Swift’s longtime antagonizers Kanye West, saying he “just needs his diaper changed so badly.”
“It’s been a long time since I would’ve taken Kanye’s call,” Antonoff added. “I’m so incredibly bored when someone doesn’t have the sauce anymore, so they go elsewhere to shock. It’s just a remarkable waste of space.”
It’s not yet confirmed that Antonoff helped produce Swift’s surprise upcoming album “The Tortured Poets Department,” although it would seem likely given he’s worked with the singer on every album dating back to “1989.” Swift pulled a fast one on her devoted fanbase when she announced the new album at the Grammys earlier this month. Everyone expected Swift to announce “Reputation (Taylor’s Version).” Instead, she revealed she had an entirely new album ready to go with 16 tracks and several bonus songs.
“I have heard some of it. It is unbelievable,” Swift’s boyfriend Travis Kelce said during a Super Bowl press conference shortly after she announced the album. “I can’t wait for her to shake up the world when it finally drops.”

The couple could not keep their hands off each other as they were spotted at a Ferdi restaurant in the City of Lights.
Bianca, 29, left little to the imagination as she dressed in a risque black dress and a pair of sheer stockings.
The Australian native slicked her short hair and combed her wet strands back.
She accessorized with gold earrings and flashed the rings on her fingers.
Kanye, 46, though kept a casual look as he wore a black T-shirt and matching pants.
Bianca exposed her booty as she wore a cropped fur coat.
Kanye's wife could face a hefty fine - or time in prison - for opting out of undergarments during her romantic dinner in France.
After strutting around displaying her genitals and backside, the star's act of ""sexual display"" in a public area could cost her a fine of €15,000 ($16,256) or one year in prison, according to Article 222-32 of the new penal code.
TOO REVEALING
Bianca has had previous run-ins with the law since tying the knot with the rapper in December 2022.
In August 2023, critics demanded Bianca get fined for public indecency over her revealing outfits in Italy.
The Yeezy designer shocked fans by wearing a see-through nude catsuit during her dinner with the Donda singer.
In photos obtained by Daily Mail Australia, Bianca flashed her nipples in the incredibly raunchy outfit.
The Australian architect covered up her cleavage with a black crossbody bag at one point.
Fans pointed out that Italy is a much more conservative country than the United States and implored authorities to fine Ye's partner over her revealing looks.
Some argued that Bianca's outfit in the country constituted ""public indecency.""
In Italy, acts ""contrary to public decency"" - including indecent dress - carry a hefty fine of €5,000-€10,000, or up to $10,848.
'NO LONGER BE WELCOME'
Weeks later, the couple faced a sanction for their public actions while on a boat in Venice.
Kanye and his wife were spotted sharing an intimate moment while being chauffeured by boat in the city.
While Bianca crouched down to Kanye's lap, the rap star flashed his bare butt to cameras and passers-by.
The company responsible for the taxi boat, Venezia Turismo Motoscafi, spoke out against the couple's behavior and slammed them with a lifetime ban from using their services.
""We completely dissociate ourselves from such acts and behavior,"" company stated.
""Mr. West and his wife will certainly no longer be welcome on board our company's boats.""

Kim Kardashian expresses frustration over Kanye West's public parenting disputes,"Kim Kardashian expressed her dismay towards her ex-husband Kanye West after he once again aired their parenting disagreements on social media.
The 46-year-old rapper took to Instagram, pleading with Kardashian to remove their four children from Sierra Canyon, the exclusive elementary school they currently attend.
In his post, Kanye labeled the school as ""fake"" and suggested it was utilized by ""the system.""
Sources close to Kim revealed to TMZ that she is frustrated by West's continual public attacks and naming of the school, as it raises safety and security concerns for their children.
Additionally, she is reportedly irked by West's assertions to their children that attending school is unnecessary.
The ex couple, who share four children – North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm– have found themselves at odds over their children's education.
Sources close to the model revealed that she enrolled their kids at Sierra Canyon due to its stellar reputation as a ""fantastic school"" and the need for consistency in their lives.
However, West has protested against the school, suggesting unaccredited teachers and his own unaccredited Donda school as alternatives.",2024-02-29T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

Oh là là.
Bianca Censori raised plenty of eyebrows when she stepped out in sheer tights (and sans underwear) for a Parisian date night with Kanye West on Tuesday, and new photos of their dinner at a celeb hotspot in the City of Light show off her full less-is-more ‘fit.
The Yeezy architect, 29, wore a sheer black tank top and tights with nothing beneath as she dined at Ferdi, a favorite of West’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian’s.

Censori wore her hair in her typical slicked-back style, teaming her barely-there outfit with black pumps and sporting a single Y/Project earring ($262) shaped like a hand flipping the middle finger.
West hugged his wife from behind as they waited for their ride, sporting a short-sleeved black tee and coordinating pants along with a Y/Project necklace ($209) that matched his wife’s earring.
Ye signed a few autographs for fans before the pair departed.

Mrs. West covered her see-through top with a cropped fur jacket by Prototypes before they stepped back into the Ritz Paris, but her bottom half was on full display as fans clamored around the couple.
The “Flashing Lights” rapper has been promoting his new album, “Vultures,” while traveling through Italy and France in recent days, with Censori making plenty of fashion statements along the way.
Whether wearing her husband’s Balenciaga jacket with black tights while having dinner with stepdaughter North West or rocking a provocative bodysuit to Milan Fashion Week, she’s found ways to remain pantsless through the European winter.
It seems like the no-pants trend isn’t going away anytime soon … at least for Censori.",2024-02-29T18:27:07Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
"Bianca Censori, soția lui Kanye West, riscă să ajungă în închisoare după ce a apărut aproape dezbrăcată în Paris","Bianca Censori, soția lui Kanye West, riscă să ajungă în închisoare după ce a apărut aproape dezbrăcată în Paris
Bianca Censori, soția lui Kanye West, riscă să ajungă în închisoare după ce a purtat doar o pereche de colanți transparenți în timpul unei ieșiri pe străzile din Paris.
Ea fost surprinsă de paparazzi în timp ce facea cumpărături în orașul iubirii într-o ținună indecentă, scrie The Independent.
În Franța, conform codului penal, este ilegal să expui „părți intime ale corpului la vedere într-un spațiu accesibil publicului”. Acest lucru se pedepsește cu un an de închisoare și o amendă de 15.000 de euro.
De când s-a căsătorit cu Kanye West, Bianca Censori a devenit cunoscută pentru alegerile sale vestimentare riscante, iar săptămâna trecută a apărut aproape goală la Săptămânii Modei de la Milano.
Legile din Italia sunt similare cu cele din Franța, întrucât Bianca poate primi o amendă de 10.000 de euro sau poate face închisoare, tot pentru alegerile făcute în materie de modă.
Curtea Constituțională italiană precizează că o persoană care își expune părți intime ale corpului în apropierea unui loc frecventat de copii ar putea fi pasibilă de o pedeapsă cu închisoarea de la patru luni la patru ani.
Se știe că Kanye West este interesat de modul în care se îmbracă partenerele sale, de aceea au apărut în presă tot felul de speculații cum că el o controlează pe actuala soție și că o obligă să se îmbrace sumar.
Kim Kardashian a vorbit anterior despre influența rapperului asupra stilului ei, în timp ce fosta soție a lui West, Julia Fox, a făcut o serie de acuzații potrivit cărora West a încercat să controleze ceea ce purta.

Kanye West Asks Kim Kardashian to Take Kids Out of 'Fake School',"Kanye West isn’t a fan of where his kids go to school in California, and he once again called for ex-wife Kim Kardashian to remove them.
In a Thursday (Feb. 29) social media post, the Chicago native put the school, which Billboard is not naming, on blast.
“KIM TAKE MY KIDS OUT … NOW IT’S A FAKE SCHOOL FOR CELEBRITIES THAT ARE USED BY ‘THE SYSTEM,” he wrote. The former couple — who finalized their divorce in November 2022 — shares four children: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm.
West added in the caption: “At this point everybody knows what ‘the system’ is code word for I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children. When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate. My two oldest know they daddy is.”
Billboard has reached out to Kim Kardashian’s rep and the school for comment.
It’s not the first time the rapper — who now goes by Ye — has railed against his kids’ education, as he took shots at the school his kids are attending on Vultures 1 anthem “Carnival.”
Trending on Billboard
“Got my kids in a fake school we ain’t,” he raps while being cut off to close out his verse on the hit.
While unhappy with the current schooling curriculum for children, Ye took it upon himself to open the Donda Academy. However, the K-12 Christian academy came under fire for its practices and eventually shut down in October 2022 following Ye’s antisemitic remarks and string of hate speech.",2024-02-29T17:38:45Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Kanye West Shuts Down Solo Album Rumors After Erick Sermon Teases ""Y3""","Earlier this month, Erick Sermon chatted with HipHopDX about a new solo project Kanye West has on the way. According to Ye, however, it's nothing but ""fake news."" At the time, Sermon claimed that he had worked alongside the Chicago MC in Florence, Italy in 2023, on material that wasn't for his joint project with Ty Dolla Sign, Vultures. He even shared details of the rumored release, stating that fans would see a return of the ""old Ye.""
“The record I was working on wasn’t what him and Ty Dolla Sign was doing at the time,” he explained. “I was working on Y3, Ye’s solo album […] Hopefully, we can finish what we started, y’know, ’cause I had him on Hip Hop. I was like, ‘You got to rhyme and we have to do the stuff that you used to do ’cause you ill at that,’ y’know? And he listened […] I had [the old Kanye] back.” Now, Ye has responded to a fan account asking about the project, making it clear that it doesn't actually exist.

El padre de Bianca Censori está furioso con Kanye West,"Kanye West habría causado la molestia del padre de Bianca Censori después de tantos escandalos en los que la ha involucrado Backgrid/The Grosby Group
El padre de Bianca Censori está buscando tener una conversación con su yerno, el rapero Kanye West, debido a preocupaciones sobre cómo la relación de su hija con el músico le ha generado una serie de problemas con la ley. Según informes, Leo, nombre del padre de Bianca, teme que Kanye esté alejando a Bianca de su familia y la esté convirtiendo en un “bien comercial vulgar”.
Te puede interesar: Bianca Censori, esposa de Kanye West, podría ir a prisión por el conjunto que utilizó en la semana de la moda en París
La preocupación de Leo surge después de que Bianca fuera fotografiada en París utilizando unas medias traslúcidas sin ropa interior durante una cena con Kanye. Este atuendo, además de generar toda clase de comentarios en redes, podría tener consecuencias legales para Bianca debido a las leyes de indecencia en Francia. Las fuentes cercanas a la familia han manifestado que esta situación está causando dolor, al ver a Bianca siendo exhibida como un “trofeo”.

Es así que Leo busca confrontar a Kanye sobre sus acciones, cuestionando cómo reaccionaría si sus propias hijas, North y Chicago, fueran tratadas de manera similar en el futuro. La actitud de Kanye, según se informa, también ha resultado en un distanciamiento de Bianca con su familia en Australia.

“Leo sinceramente quiere sentar a Kanye para hacerle saber que está haciendo daño a su familia al convertir a su amada hija en un producto comercial de mala calidad. Ningún hombre debería animar a la mujer que ama a salir en público y presentarse así. Eso no es amor. Eso es control”, declararon fuentes cercanas al Daily Mail.
Ante esta situación, el rapero podría estar en un peligro real. Leo Censori tiene antecedentes penales que datan de los años 80, cuando fue arrestado cinco años por posesión de heroína. A esto se le suma que su hermano, Eric, es conocido como “el Al Capone de Melbourne”. Sus crímenes fueron lo bastante serios como para que se le diera pena de muerte, pero al final del día, se cambió por cadena perpetua.

La familia y amigos de Bianca también han cuestionado las intenciones de Kanye en el pasado por la forma en que ha exhibido a la arquitecta. No obstante, los atuendos de Bianca poco a poco han sido menos preocupantes para sus amigos. Es “la mirada muerta en sus ojos cuando sale con Kanye”, lo que mantiene las alarmas encendidas entre sus seres queridos.

Los escandalosos conjuntos de Bianca no han sido la única polémica. Durante su paso por Venecia en 2023, un video se volvió viral donde, aparentemente, Censori le estaba realizando una felación a Kanye West en un barco. Ante esto, la pareja fue vetada de por vida de los botes y varios locales comenzaron a pedir que West y Censori fueran expulsados de Venecia.

Alles neu: Kanye West will endgültig nur Ye genannt werden!,"Kanye West (46) hatte im Jahr 2021 den Entschluss gefasst, sich umzubenennen. Ein Richter bewilligte den neuen Namen – und so heißt Kanye Omari West seitdem offiziell Ye. Allerdings setzt sich das Ganze bei seiner Community bisher wohl nicht so richtig durch, sodass er immer noch unter seinem alten Namen bekannt ist. Doch damit soll jetzt Schluss sein – Kanye aka Ye will seinen neuen Namen!
Kürzlich veröffentlichte der Rapper auf Instagram ein klares Statement. ""Mein Name ist Ye. Keine Marke oder Nummer wird mich dazu zwingen, mich so zu nennen, wie sie wollen, dass ich immer noch heiße"", hieß es in dem von ihm geposteten Screenshot eines Chatverlaufes. Auch sein Account trägt bereits den neuen Namen.
Auch von fast allen Beiträgen hat er sich verabschiedet – nur ein Ausschnitt eines Musikvideos mit Tochter North West (10) ist noch online. Mit ihr scheint der US-Amerikaner ein gutes Verhältnis zu haben. Der Promi-Spross soll sogar lieber bei ihm leben wollen als bei ihrer Mutter Kim Kardashian (43).

Kanye West publicly calls out Kim Kardashian over school choice for kids,"Kanye West has publicly called for Kim Kardashian to remove their children from their “fake school for celebrities”.
The ‘All Day’ rapper - who has previously called for his brood to be educated at his own controversial Donda Academy - claimed North, 10, Saint, eight, Chicago, six, and four-year-old Psalm are at risk of being “used by the system” and alleged he had been “removed” from his kids’ lives, putting them at risk of being “manipulated”.
He wrote on Instagram: “Kim take my kids out of Sierra Canyon now it’s a fake school for celebrities that are used by ‘the system’(sic)“
He then added in the caption: “At this point everybody knows what “the system” is code word for.

“I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate. My two oldest know they daddy is (sic)“
This isn’t the first time the ‘Heartless’ hitmaker has expressed his disdain for his children’s school, having previously accused the administration of trying to “indoctrinate them”.
He told Tucker Carlson in 2022: “All they do is take all the celebs kids and throw them into this same school.”
But Kanye claimed he and Kim had reached a “compromise”, whereby the children attended his school for extra-curricular activities.
He said: “Right now we’ve come to a compromise — but I’m not finished because I don’t compromise — but we’ve come to a compromise that my kids come to my school after school and they learn choir.”
But after Psalm questioned why he had to go for choir there, Kanye claimed he was left feeling like he didn’t “have a say” in how the children were being raised.
He said: “I sat there with [Psalm] and he came in and said, ‘why do I have to sing? I don’t even go to your school.’
“So imagine a 16-year-old version of that guy, or the 26-year-old version of that guy, where the father doesn’t have a sayso of what the kids are watching, what the kids are wearing, what the kids are eating, or who the kids are hanging out with.”",2024-02-29T16:02:58Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow
"After Kanye West Took Aim At Kim Kardashian On Instagram, One Fan Response Post Has More Than 75,000 Likes","There was a point in time when Kanye West was best known for being a rapper who expressed himself, his dreams, and his desires through music. But the subtext became the text long ago, and the multi-hyphenate mogul has become rather notorious for transparently speaking his mind online and beyond, whether it’s restocking his feud with Taylor Swift or showing off his $850K dental implants . After he took aim at Kim Kardashian’s parenting choices in a social media post, one fan shared a relatively brief response that has amassed a slew of likes from other followers.
A day after sharing headlines around the world with wife Bianca Censori over her near-nude outfit worn during a Paris Fashion Week event, West took to Instagram to call out his ex Kim Kardashian and demanded she take their children — whom he refers to as “my kids” out of the school they’re currently enrolled in. Presuming he ends up deleting the post before much longer, here’s exactly what he posted:
KIM TAKE MY KIDS OUT OF SIERRA CANYON NOW. IT'S A FAKE SCHOOL FOR CELEBRITIES THAT ARE USED BY 'THE SYSTEM'
Alongside that fairly demanding message, West offered a bit of an explanation in the post's caption, saying:
At this point everybody knows what 'the system' is code word for 👀 I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate My two oldest know they daddy is
Obviously anything that Kanye West shares with the world is going to spark a wide assortment of reactions, and this was no exception. All manner of feelings are on display in the comment thread, with fans debating just about every element possible. Many voiced understanding the lack of trust in government programs, or “the system” if you will, while others compared the rapper’s actions to the very establishments he was complaining about.
One follower is currently standing tall above all the rest, earning (at the time of this writing) more than 77,180 likes for this comment:
Just text her bro @adammakhoukh
For a clue of how popular that comment is, the majority of reactions to Kanye West's post boast likes totalling in the hundreds, with many going less than that. Only a realtively handful crested the three-digit mark, and it's possibly the only post that dipped so deeply into five-digit territory.
Of course, even that reply sparked a ton of follow-up commentary, with many agreeing with the concept that West should make these requests/demands privately instead of blasting them out on social media for all his 19.9 million followers to see where his kids are going to school. (Sierra Canyon is widely known for being an institution friendly to reality TV-adjacent nepo babies.) And more than a few question the producer's ability to critize private schooling when his own Donda Academy has been targeted with lawsuits for allegedly shady practices and financial mishandling.
Others stood in defense of West, claiming he might not be taking his gripes to Instagram if his attempts to contact Kim Kardashian were allowed to go through. Of course, it's hardly public information whose numbers the SKIMS founder has blocked on her personal phone.

We recently reported on the notion that Kim Kardashian doesn't seem to generally have issues with her children being with West and his significant other, though with the lone rule about Censori not dressing provocatively. Perhaps West's IG post was partially in response to that news making the rounds, or perhaps he has other motivations for wanting his children to be in a different learning facility.
While it lasts, here's West's post in full:

"""Falsche Schule"": Kanye West schießt wieder gegen Ex Kim!","Es ist mal wieder so weit. Im Februar 2021 reichte Kim Kardashian (43) die Scheidung von ihrem langjährigen Ehemann Kanye West (46) ein. Obwohl die Unternehmerin und der Rapper inzwischen über drei Jahre getrennt sind, schießen die beiden immer wieder öffentlich gegeneinander. Zuletzt machte es den Anschein, als ob sich das einstige Paar versöhnt hätte. Doch der Frieden hielt nicht lange an: Kanye wettert wieder gegen seine Ex Kim!
Auf Instagram teilt der 46-Jährige einen kryptischen Text mit seinen Fans – und schießt dabei mal wieder gewaltig gegen die Mutter seiner vier Sprösslinge. ""Kim, nimm meine Kinder jetzt aus dem Sierra Canyon"", fordert er seine Ex-Frau auf und begründet das Ganze folgendermaßen: ""Es ist eine falsche Schule für Berühmtheiten, die vom 'System' benutzt werden.""
In der Kommentarspalte wird Kanyes Ansage unterdessen auch schon ausgiebig diskutiert – bei den Followern stoßen seine Worte allerdings auf Unverständnis. ""Schreib ihr einfach, Bruder"", ""Warum hat er einfach allen erzählt, wo seine Kinder zur Schule gehen"" oder ""Kim lebt in deinem Kopf mietfrei"", lauten nur einige der fassungslosen Reaktionen unter dem Beitrag.

Kanye West needs diaper changed,"He’s protecting Swift’s reputation.
Music producer and frequent Taylor Swift collaborator Jack Antonoff is slamming Kanye West for his continued unprovoked attacks against the “Fearless” singer.
“I’m a little b–ch sometimes,” Antonoff, 39, told the Los Angeles Times prior to the 2024 Grammy Awards. “But you come after my friend Taylor, you’re toast to me.”
When asked about West, who has seemingly tried to reignite his feud with Swift, Antonoff laughed and said West, 46, “just needs his diaper changed so badly.”

“It’s been a long time since I would’ve taken Kanye’s call,” Antonoff said when asked if he’s worried about roasting a potential collaborator. “I’m so incredibly bored when someone doesn’t have the sauce anymore, so they go elsewhere to shock. It’s just a remarkable waste of space.”
The “Bleachers” frontman, who is a very close friend of the singer, noted that anyone who doubts the “Blank Space” singer’s talent “is like challenging someone’s faith in God.”
He added: “You just don’t go there.”
Antonoff and Swift, 34, have worked together since 2013 when the pair worked on her fifth studio album “1989.”
Following its massive success, Swift continued working with the New Jersey native on “Reputation” and has remained by his side ever since. Antonoff is expected to play some role in the songstress’ upcoming record “The Tortured Poets Department,” which was announced at the Grammy Awards.
West attempted to restart his one-sided war with Swift when he named-dropped her in his brand-new and controversial album “Vultures 1.”

“Why she say she sucked my d–k / Then she say she ain’t sucked my d–k / She gon’ take it up the a– like a ventriloquist / I made six Taylor Swift since I had the Rollie on the wrist,” West raps.
West later changed his tune when he slammed Swifties, the name for the singer’s legion of fans, for purposefully attempting to deny his album the No. 1 slot on the Billboard charts.
The accusation came after one of Swift’s fans declared a “Swiftie emergency” on X (formerly Twitter).

“SWIFTIE EMERGENCY,” read the tweet from the now-private account. “Beyonce’s new single ‘Texas Hold ‘Em’ is challenging Kanye West for #1 debut on Billboard Hot 100.”
“Let’s buy and stream Texas Hold ‘Em to block him from the top spot,” the die-hard fan continued. “Remember, he dragged Taylor on his latest Instagram story.”
West later shared a screenshot of the tweet blasting the user.
“When I said that I’m the new Jesus b–ch I wasn’t even thinking about Taylor Swift,” West ranted on Instagram. “That was a whole line before but I appreciate the free promo.”
“Lil Wayne actually mentions Travis Kelce on ‘Vultures 2,’” continued the rapper, who claimed his new music is actually “super positive and fun” and “triumphant.”
“Last year was incredibly challenging for me, my wife, my children, friends and family,” he went on, referring to the fallout after his antisemitic rants. “I’ve been banned from hotels, kicked out of companies, and even not allowed to eat in some restaurants.”

The “Heartless” singer argued that he was on Swift’s side during her spat with her former manager Scooter Braun and even claimed that Swift and Beyoncé, 42, served as musical inspirations.
“I’m sure I’ve been far more helpful to Taylor Swift’s career than harmful,” West proclaimed. “To all Taylor Swift fans, I am not your enemy uuum I’m not your friend either though lol.”
West and Swift started having bad blood in 2009 when West infamously hopped onto the MTV Video Music Awards stage during her acceptance speech and declared that Beyoncé “had one of the best videos of all time.”
West later stirred up controversy when he said he “made that bitch famous” in his 2016 song “Famous,” referring to Swift. He claimed he didn’t mean to diss Swift and that the duo “had an hourlong convo with her about the line, and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.”

Swift later refuted the allegation.
Tensions were further heightened when Kim Kardashian, who was married to West at the time, posted what appeared to be the entire conversation on her Snapchat, which seemed to indicate that Swift was lying.
According to Swift, the incident was among the “horrendous things that happened” to her and called the experience “getting canceled within an inch of my life and sanity.”
“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” Swift told Time magazine after being named 2023’s Person Of The Year. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before.”
In 2020, the real version of the call was leaked online by an unknown party and vindicated Swift.",2024-02-29T14:34:26Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
Bianca Censoris Vater: Kanye West macht meine Tochter zur „schäbigen nackten Trophäe“,"Was Bianca Censoris Vater über solche Fotos seiner Tochter denkt? Sie bringen ihn auf die Palme!
Von: Ina Michaelis-Ugwonno
Jetzt platzt dem Papa der Kragen! Bislang hat ihre Familie nur kopfschüttelnd zugeschaut, wie Skandal-Rapper Kanye West (46) seine Ehefrau Bianca Censori (29) als seine „Nackt-Sklavin“ inszeniert. Doch der neueste Klamotten-Schocker des kontroversen Pärchens, geht offenbar endgültig zu weit:
In Paris tauchte Bianca an der Seite ihres Mannes in einer durchsichtigen Strumpfhose auf, unter der sie NICHTS trug. Während sie obenrum einen kurzen Fellmantel anhatte, suchte man untenrum vergeblich nach einem Höschen. SO stiefelten die beiden ins Restaurant Ferdi. Einfach nur geschmacklos!
Unten ohne in Paris: Bianca Censori stiefelt mit einer durchsichtigen Strumpfhose durch die Nacht. Hinter ihr läuft Ehemann Kanye West
Auch Biancas Vater Elia „Leo“ Censori (69) reagiert geschockt – er will den exzentrischen US-Rapper nun zur Rede stellen!
„Biancas Vater Leo will sich mit Kanye zusammensetzen und ihn fragen, was er sich dabei denkt, wenn er Bianca wie eine schäbige nackte Trophäe vorführt“, verriet eine Bianca nahestehende Quelle gegenüber der „ Daily Mail “.
Von vorn und von hinten war auf offener Straße zu sehen, dass Bianca unter der durchsichtigen Strumpfhose keine Unterwäsche trug
Die in Australien aufgewachsene ehemalige „Yeezy“-Mitarbeiterin Bianca Censori stammt aus einer italienischen Familie, mit der man sich besser nicht anlegt . Ihr Vater hat einiges auf dem Kerbholz, saß laut australischen Medien zwei Jahre wegen Drogenhandels und illegalen Waffenbesitzes hinter Gittern.
Er will nun angeblich von Kanye West wissen, „was er tun würde, wenn seine Töchter North oder Chicago in der Öffentlichkeit halb nackt in Outfits gesehen würden, zu denen sie von ihren Ehemännern ermutigt wurden“, heißt es. Denn er könne sich nicht vorstellen, dass der Skandal-Rapper so etwas später bei seinen eigenen Mädchen, die jetzt noch Kinder sind (10 und 6), zulassen würde.
Immer wieder zeigt sich Bianca spärlich bekleidet an der Seite von Kanye, der sich selbst gerne verhüllt. So wie hier am 23. Februar bei der Mailänder Fashion Week
„Kein Mann sollte die Frau, die er liebt, jemals dazu ermutigen, in der Öffentlichkeit so aufzutreten und sich so zu präsentieren“, fasst der Insider die Meinung von Papa Censori zusammen. „Das ist keine Liebe. Das ist Kontrolle.“
Nicht nur Biancas Vater, auch ihre Fans machten sich in den vergangenen Monaten immer wieder Sorgen, halten die Beziehung zu Kanye West für toxisch und forderten bereits: „Sie muss gerettet werden!“
Vielleicht kann ja Biancas Vater den beiden ins Gewissen reden …",2024-02-29T14:04:32Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD
Los hijos de Donna Summer denuncian a Kanye West por usar ‘I Feel Love’ en una de sus canciones,"El nuevo álbum de Kanye West, que desde hace unos años cambió su nombre artístico a Ye, Vultures 1, está siendo controvertido en muchos aspectos. No solo porque las revistas musicales hayan hecho feroces críticas contra la nueva lista sonora del artista, sino porque la familia de la cantante Donna Summer ha denunciado una supuesta copia de I Feel Love, una de las canciones más populares de la cantante estadounidense, que falleció en 2012 a causa de un cáncer. La revista estadounidense TMZ, ha publicado este miércoles los documentos oficiales de la denuncia, que fue presentada por los herederos de Summer en un tribunal federal de California, y en donde acusan a Ye de haber falsificado sin permiso el éxito de 1977, utilizando “partes reconocibles” de la canción en el tema Good (Don’t Die). Todo ello después de que los mismos herederos hubiesen rechazado explícitamente y por escrito su petición de utilizarla el pasado 3 de febrero de 2024.
Los abogados de la familia de Summer han asegurado públicamente que dejan el caso en manos de la justicia, mientras que los abogados de West, y su productora, Ty Dolla $ign, ―que también ha sido demandada―, no han emitido ningún comunicado al respecto. “El patrimonio de Summer no solo consideró el inmenso valor comercial de la composición I Feel Love, sino también la potencial degradación del legado de Summer. West es conocido como una figura pública controvertida cuya conducta ha llevado a numerosas marcas y socios comerciales a desvincularse de él”, argumenta la demanda, que asegura que el cantante volvió a grabar la parte concreta de la pieza falsificada con una cantante diferente a pesar de la “prohibición absoluta” de los herederos del patrimonio de Summer. Además, han solicitado una indemnización por daños y perjuicios y piden al juez encargado del caso que impida permanentemente a Ye infringir los derechos de autor de la icónica artista.
Apple Music retiró el álbum solo cinco días después de su debut en la plataforma después de verse afectado por problemas de infracción de derechos de autor, tal como pública el diario británico Daily Mail. Vultures 1 fue eliminado brevemente de Apple Music e iTunes, donde la canción Carnival había ocupado el puesto número uno en el Top 100: lista global.
Muy similar es el caso que ha enfrentado a Ye con el legendario rockero y ex cantante de Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, que le denegó permiso para reproducir su canción War pigs. Pero el pasado 9 de febrero, el icono del heavy metal fue informado de que el rapero utilizó parte de otro de sus clásicos, Iron Man, para el Vultures 1. Indignado, Osbourne respondió a West en un post en Instagram en el que explicaba las razones de su monumental cabreo: “Le denegué el permiso para samplear mis canciones porque es un antisemita y ha causado dolor y problemas a mucha gente”. Además, su mujer, Sharon Osbourne, sentenció que Ye se había “metido con el judío equivocado”. “Sencillamente, es que no queremos que se nos asocie con alguien que hace declaraciones de odio. Difundir el odio, como él lo hace, no debería permitirse. Todas las excusas, que si es bipolar o lo que sea, no sirven. ¡Que se vaya a la mierda!”.
El rapero estadounidense tuvo que pedir disculpas públicamente en diciembre de 2023, después de protagonizar múltiples titulares por sus comentarios de odio hacia los judíos. En diciembre, se vio obligado a borrar todo el contenido de su perfil en la red social Instagram y publicado una disculpa en hebreo a los judíos tras años de comentarios antisemitas. “Pido sinceras disculpas a la comunidad judía por cualquier exabrupto involuntario causado por mis palabras o acciones. No era mi intención herir o faltar al respeto, y lamento profundamente cualquier dolor que haya podido causar”, ha escrito en hebreo, lengua que no entienden muchos de sus compatriotas judíos. West se vio envuelto en toda esta polémica por insinuar que el rapero Sean Combs, más conocido como Puff Daddy, estaba siendo controlado “por los judíos”. Entonces, el Comité Judío Estadounidense (AJC, por sus siglas en inglés) que acusó a West de perpetuar “prejuicios antisemitas como la codicia y el control”.
Otro de los grandes quebraderos de cabeza que envuelven al rapero procede de una de sus colaboraciones con Adidas, a la que acusa de vender sus populares zapatillas Yeezy en colores que él nunca aprobó. La marca ha demandado al artista por sus comentarios y le pide una indemnización de 250 millones de dólares por incumplir el contrato en cuestión. West subió a sus redes una foto portando las zapatillas junto a un mensaje en el que aseguraba que “Cualquiera que ame a Ye no compraría estos Yeezys falsos”. “La gente está viendo cómo una compañía del Fortune 500 viola a uno de sus ídolos. Están utilizando cláusulas contractuales y 50 años de experiencia empresarial para demandar a uno de sus artistas favoritos, justo delante de todos ustedes a plena luz del día. Nadie dice nada ni hace nada. ¿Qué van a hacer ahora, cancelar mi álbum de nuevo, congelar mis cuentas otra vez, amenazar a la gente con no volver a trabajar conmigo?”, afirmó entonces en sus redes sociales.",2024-02-29T13:59:29Z,https://elpais.com,El País
"Kanye West se balade tout en Decathlon, en pleine Fashion Week parisienne","MEGA / GC Images MEGA / GC Images
MODE - Kanye West, à fond la forme. Ce mercredi 28 février, le rappeur américain controversé a été aperçu au bras de sa petite amie Bianca Censori en train de sortir de leur hôtel parisien. Le tout, cagoulé comme à son habitude et habillé d’une marque de sport bien étrangère à la Fashion Week, qui se tient en ce moment à la capitale : Decathlon.

L’initiative peut surprendre, Kanye West nous ayant habitués à fréquenter les premiers rangs de certaines grandes maisons de mode, comme Balenciaga. Ce n’est en revanche pas le premier rappeur à avoir été conquis par l’équipementier sportif, comme l’a rappelé sur X (anciennement Twitter) Decathlon, ce jeudi.

Kanye West’s Warning to Ex-Wife Kim Has Shocking Accusations About Bryce James’ School,"Kanye West strikes again! This time, shots have been fired at Kim Kardashian in a bizarre social media post where he is asking her to take their children out of Sierra Canyon, the private school his children attend. In his latest Instagram post, he urged Kim to remove his kids from the school, calling it “a fake school for celebrities that are used by “the system“. Guess who else goes to the school that is allegedly used by “the system”? NBA superstar LeBron James‘ son, Bryce James. Both James’s sons, Bronny and Bryce James, attended Sierra Canyon, California. Bryce recently returned to the school for his junior year after transferring to Notre Dame.
So, what’s Ye’s beef with the school? Sierra Canyon is a prestigious, co-educational institution favored by many Los Angeles celebrities. Kanye’s post came along with a caption that reads: “At this point, everybody knows what “the system” is code word for (looking eye emoji) I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate My two oldest know they daddy“.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ye (@ye)
This isn’t the first time Kanye has expressed his disapproval of the school. In October 2022, Ye remarked, “All they do is take all the celebs kids and throw them into this same school,” about Sierra Canyon, and accused them of “indoctrinating” students. As per West, “the system” when drafting athletes doesn’t prefer “those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate“.
So, it makes us wonder, is Sierra Canyon really that bad? If so, why is King James sending his younger son there?
LeBron James’ journey with Sierra Canyon
It’s worth noting that LA Lakers superstar LeBron James’s experience with Sierra Canyon stands in contrast. His sons, rising basketball talents Bronny and Bryce James have had an interesting journey through Sierra Canyon’s program.
In 2019, Bronny, then a freshman, joined the school alongside his brother Bryce and Zaire Wade, son of NBA legend Dwyane Wade. Coached by Andre Chevalier, Sierra Canyon already had impressive credentials, having secured the previous two state titles. The 2019-20 season saw the team under the national spotlight, with ESPN broadcasting 15 of their games.
Fast forward to November 2023, and Bryce, now a junior, embarked on his third school transfer within six months, returning to Sierra Canyon. The 6-foot-6 shooting guard had previously spent his freshman at the school alongside Bronny, who went on to play college basketball at USC. As his biggest supporter, Bron is often seen cheering on his son from the sidelines, establishing his presence within the Sierra Canyon community.
It remains unclear whether Kanye’s accusations hold merit or if his desire simply stems from wanting his children to attend his own Donda Academy. Meanwhile, from where James is sitting, in his case, “the system” picked athletes (both his sons) despite having a father actively involved in their lives.

"Censori, mujer de Kanye West, podría ir a la cárcel por llevar medias sin ropa interior en París","Que Bianca Censori, esposa del rapero Kanye West, se pasee con unos extravagantes diseños que poco dejan a la imaginación de quienes la ven ya no sorprende a casi nadie. Pero lo que sí es noticia es que esta vez uno de sus atuendos podría llevarla a la prisión por saltarse la normativa de decencia pública.
Los hechos ocurrieron este martes en Francia, cuando la pareja, de gira por Europa, acudía a la Semana de la Moda de París y la arquitecta dejaba atónitos a todos los viandantes, que no podían dejar de hacerle fotos, con un curioso conjunto compuesto por unas medias traslúcidas (bajo las que no llevaba no ropa interior) y una chaqueta de piel a modo de abrigo con unas letras grabadas en la espalda. De hecho, los propios paparazzi han decidido pixelar las zonas más íntimas en las imágenes.
Una combinación, la escogida, que desafiaría las normativas de decencia pública del país galo, por lo que podría enfrentarse a sanciones legales que incluso tendrían aparejada una pena de prisión si así lo acordase un juez.
Más información Kanye West, criticado por subir unas fotos de su esposa, Bianca Censori, casi desnuda El rapero ha publicado en Instagram tres post en los que aparece su mujer en tanga o con un corsé que no le cubre el pecho.
Y es que el artículo 222-32 del nuevo Código Penal francés, que se encuentra vigente desde marzo del año 1994, sanciona la exhibición sexual deliberada antes terceros en zonas públicas con un año de prisión y una multa de 15.000 euros.

Eso sí, como decíamos, ni es la primera vez que Censori desafía las normas con su ropa ni la última en que los usuarios de redes sociales cargan contra el rapero por considerar que está tratando a su nueva pareja como un objeto y que él es quien está detrás de estos polémicos looks.
West, que ahora se hace llamar Ye, ha sido acusado de controlar la vida de su esposa e imponerle diferentes normas, desde la forma de vestir hasta el uso que pueda hacer de internet o las redes sociales. Incluso, el padre de la joven arquitecta se estaría planteando tener una dura charla con el músico para tratar de aclarar la situación con su hija, por quien sufre desde que se casó con el ex de Kim Kardashian.

Kanye West has publicly asked his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, to take their children out of their “fake school for celebrities.”
“Kim take my kids out of Sierra Canyon now it’s a fake school for celebrities that are used by ‘the system,'” the rapper wrote in all-caps on Instagram Wednesday night.
He captioned the bizarre post, “At this point everybody knows what ‘the system’ is code word for. I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children.
The exes, who have been divorced since 2021, share four kids: North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4.
Since their rocky split, the pair have been arguing about how to raise their children.

“When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate.”
“My two oldest know they daddy is,” the “All Falls Down” hitmaker added.
The four kids attend Sierra Canyon School full-time, but used to have extracurricular activities at West’s now-shuttered Donda Academy — a Christian private school opened by the rapper in 2022 and named after his late mother Donda West.

While Ye might not agree with all of Kardashian’s parenting techniques, he previously admitted that the Skims founder has their kids “80 percent of the time.”
The musician’s past antics have caused major friction between the exes in recent years, with Kardashian even ramping up security measures for her children during West’s public outbursts in 2022.

The mom of four hired additional security to guard her kids’ private school at the time, but made it clear it was not to protect her progeny from their dad, but because the Yeezy designer revealed the school’s name.
West, 46, has been on a full self-guided press tour ranting about how he would prefer his kids to attend Donda Academy, where parents reportedly have to sign NDAs.

In Sept. 2022, the “All of the Lights” rapper said he and Kardashian had a “good conversation” about their kids’ education.
However, it appears any headway the former pair had made has come to a screeching halt, as West told Tucker Carlson that he isn’t willing to “compromise” when it comes to education.

Nach Zoff um Samples: Ozzy Osbourne kritisiert Kanye erneut,"Kanye West (46) machte in der Vergangenheit diverse Negativschlagzeilen: Des Öfteren äußerte er sich offen diskriminierend und antisemitisch. Dies ist auch der Grund, weshalb Ozzy Osbourne (75) ihm untersagte, einen Part seiner Black-Sabbath-Samples zu verwenden – den Skandalrapper interessierte das jedoch weniger und er umging das Verbot geschickt. Doch trotzdem bereut es Ozzy nicht, Kanye ordentlich Paroli geboten zu haben!
""Nun, niemand sonst würde es verdammt noch mal tun, oder?"", äußert sich der britische Rockmusiker im Gespräch mit Rolling Stone. Ozzy macht erneut klar, was er von Kanye hält: ""Es ist falsch, wenn man nichts über ihn sagt. Ich möchte nicht, dass meine Arbeit, in welcher Form auch immer, mit so etwas in Verbindung gebracht wird."" Laut dem ""Crazy Train""-Interpret gebe es schon genug Ärger auf der Welt und Kanyes Aussagen seien einfach unnötig: ""Es ist einfach falsch.""
Ozzys Ehefrau Sharon (71) steht bei dem Streit ganz klar auf der Seite ihres Liebsten und schimpfte kürzlich in einem TMZ-Interview heftig über den Ex von Kim Kardashian (43). ""Der Motherf***er ist ein Schwein"", lautete ihr hartes Urteil. Sharon zufolge repräsentiere Kanye Hass und sei ein ""respektloser Antisemit.""

Yeat & Ye Join for Rap's First Top Two Billboard 200 Rule Since 2021,"For the first time in 122 weeks, hip-hop albums seize both the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard 200 albums chart. On the list dated Feb. 24, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures 1 reigns, while Yeat’s 2093 debuts at No. 2. This makes for the first time that hip-hop has twin titles atop the chart since Oct. 30, 2021, when Young Thug’s Punk and Drake’s Certified Lover Boy nabbed the top two spots.

The Punk–Certified Lover Boy moment was the ninth such double for hip-hop on the Billboard 200 in 2021, capping a year that saw additional chart-toppers from Moneybagg Yo, DJ Khaled, J. Cole, Lil Baby, Lil Durk, Tyler the Creator, and YoungBoy Never Broke Again. But, despite no one-two lockdown in 2022 or 2023, hip-hop still maintained top standing among listeners, with R&B/hip-hop as both years’ most-streamed genre by total album consumption, according to Luminate. (R&B/hip-hop is an umbrella genre for Luminate that contains most titles categorized as R&B and/or rap. Individual statistics for R&B or rap are not available for the purposes of such research.)
While hip-hop’s 122-week break between holding both the gold and silver medal is certainly rare for this era, it doesn’t quite touch the record gap of just under four years in the early 1990s. On the chart dated Jan. 19, 1991, Vanilla Ice’s To The Extreme and MC Hammer’s Please Hammer Don’t Hurt ‘Em ranked at Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, marking the 12th consecutive week that the blockbuster albums had locked up the top two spots. After those titans surrendered the summit, hip-hop needed until Nov. 5, 1994, to recapture the top pair, with the Murder Was the Case soundtrack (No. 1) and Scarface’s The Diary (No. 2) becoming the magic combination.

As hip-hop scores its winning week, two different hip-hop No. 1 albums – Vultures 1 and 21 Savage’s American Dream – in the first two months of the year already prevents a repeat of a discussion point that piqued interest in 2023. Last year, the genre didn’t find a No. 1 album in the first half of the year – the longest wait of any calendar year since 1993. Largely due to the dominance of albums such as SZA’s R&B set SOS and Morgan Wallen’s country collection One Thing at a Time, hip-hop couldn’t capture the flag until July, when Lil Uzi Vert’s Pink Tape finally ended the shutout.",2024-02-29T00:34:21Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

The “Gold Digger” hitmaker wore a tracksuit that featured a metallic strip across the bottom of his baggy pants and matching jacket. He kept his face hidden by adding a black face mask — a style that has recently become his signature fashion piece.
Meanwhile, Censori covered up in a floor-length trench coat and black sock boots. She slicked her brunette hair back so her earrings were fully visible.

If they were enjoying their time in the City of Light, fans wouldn’t know. Censori looked down and kept a straight face the entire time she was photographed and West’s features were hidden.
The pair made headlines Tuesday while attending Paris Fashion Week, as the University of Melbourne graduate wore her most daring outfit yet by choosing to wear sheer tights as pants — with no underwear underneath.
Her entire crotch and rear end were on full display as she walked into their posh hotel, and West, who previously criticized his ex, Kim Kardashian, for dressing too provocatively, proudly trailed her.

He was dressed in a similar outfit Monday when he was seen shopping in Paris with Censori, who again chose to leave little to the imagination by wearing tights as pants. She also sported a skintight three-quarter-sleeve top that hugged her chest.
The night before, however, Censori decided to cover up for a one-on-one outing in Paris with West’s eldest daughter, 10-year-old North.

North West Shares Adorable Throwback Photo With Dad Kanye West: TikTok,"North West revealed a cute old photo of herself and her dad Kanye West in a new TikTok post on Tuesday, February 27. The 10-year-old included the photo in a selfie as she showed off a bunch of pictures of herself. It’s not entirely clear where the old photo is from, but it’s a sweet moment of herself and her dad, 46. The “Power” rapper is holding her up in the cute photo.
The photo was the sixth in a series of other photos that North had shared. Most of the photos were selfies of herself solo, but a few had other friends in them. In a bunch of them she was making funny faces, and she captioned the post with a simple “lol.” The slideshow was set to the song “Tadow” by Masego and FKJ. The photo with her dad was in a frame that said “Paris” across the top. It could be seen sitting on the table as North took a mirror selfie. She rocked a pink headband and white top as she made a “peace” sign in the mirror. In the shot, they were both wearing black outfits, and they seemed to be smiling wide.
Aside from the selfies series, North is no stranger to expressing herself on social media. Earlier in February, she showed fans what she would look like as a blonde as she danced around in a wig in a video. Back around Valentine’s Day, she showed off a glittery red and pink makeup look as she painted her whole face the two colors for the holiday in another TikTok video.
Besides her TikTok presence, North has also dipped her toes into making music, as she made a guest appearance on Yeezy’s new album Vultures. She got a guest verse on his collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign on the track “Talking/Once Again.” Her verse was short but sweet. “It’s your bestie. Miss, miss Westie,” she raps. “Don’t tryna test me / It’s gonna get messy / It’s gonna get messy / Just, just bless me.”",2024-02-28T21:54:07Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
"Kanye West, dat în judecată de moştenitorii Donnei Summer pentru utilizarea melodiei „I Feel Love”","Kanye West, dat în judecată de moştenitorii Donnei Summer pentru utilizarea melodiei „I Feel Love”
Administratorii moştenirii lăsate de legendara cântăreaţă disco Donna Summer au intentat marţi proces într-un tribunal federal din California împotriva lui Ye.
Rapperul cunoscut anterior sub numele Kanye West, pe care l-au acuzat că a încorporat fără permisiune hitul ''I Feel Love'', din 1977, în noul său album, informează Reuters.
Potrivit documentelor depuse în instanţă, Ye şi cântăreţul Ty Dolla $ign au folosit părţi ''recognoscibile instant'' din melodia cântăreţei în piesa lor ''Good (Don't Die)'', de pe albumul pe care l-au realizat în colaborare ''Vultures 1'', deşi administratorii moştenirii au respins explicit cerere lor de a folosi melodia.
Reprezentanţii lui Ye şi ai lui Ty Dolla $ign, pe numele real Tyrone Griffin, nu au putut fi contactaţi pentru a comenta informaţia. Avocatul moştenitorilor Donnei Summer a spus că ''va lăsa plângerea să vorbească de la sine''.
Ye, care şi-a schimbat în mod legal numele din Kanye West în 2021, a stârnit indignare în 2022 cu o serie de postări antisemite pe reţelele de socializare. Rapperul şi-a prezentat scuze în decembrie.
Ye şi Griffin au lansat ''Vultures 1'' pe 10 februarie. În prezent, este albumul cel mai bine vândut în Statele Unite, potrivit Billboard.
Administratorii moştenirii au precizat că au respins pe 3 februarie cererea de a le permite lui Ye şi lui Griffin să folosească ''I Feel Love''.
''Administratorii moştenirii au luat în considerare nu doar valoare comercială imensă a piesei 'I Feel Love', dar şi potenţiala degradare a moştenirii lui Summer'', se mai spune în plângere. ''West este cunoscut ca o figură publică controversată, cu un comportament ce a determinat numeroase branduri şi parteneri de afaceri să se disocieze de el''.
Potrivit documentelor juridice, Ye şi Griffin au înregistrat din nou ''I Feel You'', cu un cântăreţ diferit, în ciuda ''interzicerii absolute'' din partea administratorilor de a folosi melodia lui Summer sau ''un sunet asemănător''.
Moştenitorii au solicitat pagube materiale şi au cerut curţii să-i împiedice permanent pe Ye şi Griffin să mai încalce copyright-ul cântecelor Donnei Summer.

Kanye West issues stern demands to ex Kim Kardashian about kids,"Kanye West issues stern demands to ex Kim Kardashian about kids
Kanye West demanded his ex-wife Kim Kardashian on social media to withdraw their four children from the school that they are currently attending.
The rapper, who officially changed his Instagram handle to Ye, shared a photo of a message, which was written in all caps.
“Kim take my kids out of Sierra Canyon now,” the message read. “It’s a fake school for celebrities that are used by ‘the system.’”
In the caption, the Vultures musician wrote, “At this point everybody knows what ‘the system’ is code word for [eyes emoji].”
“I was removed from my dad by the system and the system removed me from my children,” he continued. “When the system drafts athletes they avoid working with those who have their father in their life because they are harder to manipulate.”
He ended the caption, adding, “My two oldest know they daddy.”
Kim and Ye are parents to four kids: North West, 10, Saint West, 8, Chicago West, 6, and Psalm West, 4.

Bianca Censori’s father is furious over Kanye West over how he is treating his daughter and parading her around like a ‘naked trophy pony.’
The controversial couple made headlines once again after the Yeezy designer, 29, was pictured wearing sheer stockings with no underwear as they headed out to dinner in Paris, France on Tuesday.
Bianca’s family is hurting watching her this way. Moreover, her father, who is reportedly the brother of a notorious gangland killer, wants to confront Ye.
“Bianca’s father Leo wants to have a proper sit down with Kanye and ask him what the hell he is thinking when he parades Bianca around like a trashy naked trophy pony,” a source told DailyMail.
Leo wants ask the rapper “what he would do if his daughters North, or Chicago, were seen in public half-naked in outfits encouraged by their husbands.”
The source added, “He knows that there is no way in hell that Kanye would allow this for his daughters so it makes no sense why he would encourage this for his own wife.”
Moreover, Kanye is also “shutting out” Bianca from her own family. “Leo honestly wants to just sit Kanye down to let him know that he is hurting her family by turning his beloved daughter into a trashy-looking marketable commodity,” the insider said.
The source also noted that this behaviour “isn’t love” but it is “control.” They surmised, “No man should ever encourage the woman that he loves to walk out in public and present herself like this.”",2024-02-28T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

The 46-year-old rapper recently went on a since-deleted rant on Instagram, where he called out internet users for not respecting his wishes about being called Ye.

Jack Antonoff says Kanye West needs ‘his diaper changed’ amid Taylor Swift feud,"Kanye West recently name-dropped Taylor Swift on his new album ‘Vultures 1’
Jack Antonoff won’t stand for Kanye West trash talking Taylor Swift.
Amid Swift and West’s longtime feud, the Bleachers frontman was quick to rush to Swift’s defense – who is one of his most prolific collaborators and long-time friend.
Per the Daily Mail, the record producer claimed that the legendary rapper “just needs his diaper changed so badly,” indirectly calling him a big baby.
Antonoff’s remarks come after West and Swift’s feud recently picked up heat, with the Runaway rapper defended name-dropping Swift in his new album Vultures 1.
He further doubled down on his claims that he is the reason behind Swift’s success.
“I’m sure I’ve been far more helpful to Taylor Swift’s career than harmful,” he wrote on his Instagram.
However, he did not extend an olive branch, writing, “To all Taylor Swift fans I am not your enemy uuum I’m not your friend either though lol.”
Meanwhile, Antonoff has been vocally supportive and fiercely loyal to the international pop sensation.
Previously, he also rushed to Swift’s defense when Gorillaz and Blue frontman Damon Albarn claimed Swift “doesn’t write her own songs.”
In response, Antonoff said, “I've never met Damon Albarn and he's never been to my studio but apparently he knows more than the rest of us about all those songs Taylor writes and brings in.”",2024-02-28T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
"Kanye West & Bianca Censori Encourage Paris Crowd To Chant ""F*** Adidas""","It's no secret that Kanye West has had his fair share of problems with Adidas, but luckily for the Chicago MC, it looks like his fans have his back. Earlier today, he and his wife Bianca Censori were spotted leaving The Ritz in Paris, where they were immediately swarmed by paparazzi. A few of them even started shouting ""f*ck Adidas,"" which prompted a smirk from Censori.
Ye seemed to appreciate the sentiment too, though his expression was tough to make out through his full face covering. He did take a moment to encourage onlookers to chant louder, however, and later scratched ""f*ck Adidas"" across a fan's copy of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.

The chant comes weeks after Ye posted a photo alongside CEO Bjorn Gulden, sparking rumors of a reunion. The rumors were quickly squashed, however.

""I never made these color ways I’m not getting paid off of them and adidas is suing me. All these celebrities and the public will stand against a T shirt or the color of my hat but when yall see me have my children hidden from me or see an actual Fortune 500 company rape one of your heroes in real life don’t nobody say nothing or do nothing.""

Donna Summer’s Estate Sues Ye for Sampling ‘I Feel Love’,"When Ye and Ty Dolla Sign asked last month for permission to sample Donna Summer’s 1977 song “I Feel Love,” the disco singer’s estate firmly told them no. Yet when their joint LP, “Vultures 1,” was released weeks ago, a song with strong similarities to Summer’s famous tune was there on the track list.
A copyright infringement lawsuit detailing that timeline was filed against Ye, the rapper once known as Kanye West, and Ty Dolla Sign on Tuesday by Summer’s husband and executor, Bruce Sudano. Summer, known as the “Queen of Disco,” had three consecutive double albums reach No. 1 in the late 1970s and died of cancer in 2012.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, said that Summer’s estate “wanted no association with West’s controversial history.”
Ye, once one of the biggest music stars on the planet, lost professional associations with the Creative Artists Agency and Adidas in 2022 after he threatened in an online post to go “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE,” among other antisemitic statements. He has apologized in a Hebrew-language social media post.",2024-02-28T18:49:13Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
Kanye West Sued By Donna Summer’s Estate For Sampling Her Song,"Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign are facing a copyright infringement lawsuit after sampling a Donna Summer song on their new album Vultures. The late star’s husband Bruce Sudano, who is the executor of her estate, filed the suit against the two rappers in California on Tuesday, February 27, and claimed that Kanye, 46, and Ty, 41, were not given permission to use Donna’s song “I Feel Love” on their song “Good (Don’t Die).”
According to Bruce, Kanye and Ty reached out to Donna’s estate about sampling her song, but they were denied. “The Summer Estate not only considered the immense commercial value of the ‘I FEEL LOVE’ composition, but also the potential degradation to Summer’s legacy,” the lawsuit read, according to Pitch Fork. It also noted that Kanye “is known as a controversial public figure whose conduct has led numerous brands and business partners to disassociate from him.”
Bruce claimed that after turning down Kanye and Ty’s request, the musicians went to Donna’s record label, Universal Music Enterprises, regarding using the song in their album. The label also denied them, but they still sampled “I Feel Love” on their album “without permission.” Bruce’s suit described Kanye and Ty’s use of the song on Vultures as “an unauthorized interpolation.”
Per Variety, the suit from Donna’s estate seeks to “recover compensatory damages, maximum statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and disgorgement of any profits.” The suit is reportedly requesting $150,000 for each act of infringement. Kanye and Ty’s lawyers have yet to speak out about the case.
After Vultures was released February 10, Bruce released a statement on Instagram slamming the rappers for stealing Donna’s song. “@kanyewest asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!” Bruce wrote. After his complaint, “Good (Don’t Die)” was removed from streaming services including Spotify.
Kanye’s new album also features a sampling of Ozzy Osbourne‘s song “War Pigs,” but Ozzy claimed on social media earlier in February that Kanye did not have his permission to do so. The Black Sabbath rocker said he turned down Kanye’s request to use the song because of the rapper’s antisemitic behavior.",2024-02-28T17:13:43Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
"Jack Antonoff Reflects on Taylor Swift, Damon Albarn & Kanye West","Jack Antonoff knows exactly where he stands. In a Wednesday (Feb. 28) interview with the Los Angeles Times, the 39-year-old producer reflected on the moments he’s called out artists such as Damon Albarn – who in 2022 came under fire for questioning Taylor Swift’s songwriting credentials – and Kanye West.
“I’m a little b—h sometimes,” he told the publication. “But you come after my friend Taylor, you’re toast to me.”
Trending on Billboard
The interview comes more than two years after Albarn ruffled feathers by saying Swift “doesn’t write her own songs” in an interview. The “Anti-Hero” singer – who’s a frequent collaborator of Antonoff’s — quickly shut down the claims with a heated post on X, writing, “I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this … Your hot take is completely false and SO damaging.”
Albarn later apologized and said that his remarks had been “reduced to clickbait,” but not before Antonoff slammed the Blur frontman in a tweet of his own. “i’ve never met damon albarn and he’s never been to my studio but apparently he knows more than the rest of us about all those songs taylor writes and brings in. Herb,” the former Fun band member wrote at the time.
In the new interview, Antonoff said that questioning Swift’s songwriting prowess “is like challenging someone’s faith in God,” adding, “You just don’t go there.”
The Bleachers founder is fresh off his third producer of the year Grammy win in a row. He and Swift also won album of the year at the 2024 awards thanks to their work on the “Karma” musician’s Midnights LP.
And while accepting the prize for best pop vocal earlier in the ceremony, Swift announced the duo’s latest project together: The Tortured Poets Department, which arrives April 19.
As for West – who’s notably an adversary of Swift’s — Antonoff has long been critical. In 2022, he called the “Donda” rapper a “little b—h” in response to Ye’s many antisemitic comments that year, and in late January, he tweeted, “kanye on bleachers release date is hilarious little cry baby b-tch.” (The rapper’s Vultures 2 and Bleachers’ self-titled album are both scheduled to arrive March 8.)
To the L.A. Times, Antonoff reiterated that West “just needs his diaper changed so badly.”
“It’s been a long time since I would’ve taken Kanye’s call,” he added when asked about whether he’d want to work with Ye in the future. “I’m so incredibly bored when someone doesn’t have the sauce anymore, so they go elsewhere to shock. It’s just a remarkable waste of space.”",2024-02-28T17:12:33Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Kanye West's Old Comments About Meek Mill Re-Emerge Following New Diddy Lawsuit,"Last year, Diddy faced a series of damning lawsuits alleging a wide range of sexual misconduct. While it began with accusations leveled by Cassie, that suit was settled very quickly and in following proceedings very few other notable names were implicated alongside Diddy. That hasn't been true of the most recent series of allegations which has already roped in names like Stevie J, Yung Miami, and Nicki Minaj. But the newest lawsuit features some more direct allegations. While Meek Mill and Usher aren't mentioned by name, it didn't take fans long to find out that they were being discussed.
Investigations into the accusations made in the newest suit feature some descriptions that don't do a great job of hiding who they're talking about. It alleges that Diddy spoke on having sexual relations with two other notable figures in addition to Stevie J. The lawsuit mentions ""Philadelphia rapper who dated Nicki Minaj"" and ""who performed at the Super Bowl and had a successful Vegas residency."" Fans pretty easily deciphered that it was talking about Meek Mill and Usher. In the wake of the revelation, some have brought up a Kanye West interview from back in 2022. In this particular clip he mentions them both. Check out what he has to say below.

Fans might remember the clip from when it went viral just a few years ago. West goes from angry shouting to hysterical laughing across just a few minutes. He begins by calling out various rap figures that he believes were sent after him as part of some kind of contract. The rant connects to a conversation about his daughter allegedly being hidden from him. The situation wasn't resolved until Travis Scott gave him the address she was at.
But by the end of the recording West is laughing hysterically. He's seemingly very amused by the idea that Meek Mill was ""sent after him"" by someone. What do you think of the old audio of Kanye West talking about Meek Mill and Diddy? Do you think he was trying to tell fans that something was going on behind the scenes?

Εμφανίστηκε χωρίς εσώρουχο στο Παρίσι,"Σοκ προκάλεσε η δημόσια και σχεδόν γυμνή εμφάνιση της συζύγου του Kanye West, Bianca Censori, στο Παρίσι. Αναφορές ότι αντιμετωπίζει ποινές.
Μια νέα αποκαλυπτική εμφάνιση, που τους άφησε όλους άφωνους, πραγματοποίησε η σύντροφος του Kanye West, Bianca Censori.
Αυτή τη φορά, η 29χρονη αρχιτέκτονας, που “τραβάει” συχνά τα βλέμματα πάνω της με τα σχεδόν γυμνά της outfits, εμφανίστηκε δημόσια στο Παρίσι, όπου βρίσκεται για την Εβδομάδα Μόδας, χωρίς να φοράει εσώρουχο.
Συγκεκριμένα, η Bianca Censori εθεάθη να βγαίνει από ένα SUV την Τρίτη (27/02) και να περπατάει στο πεζοδρόμιο, φορώντας ένα διάφανο καλσόν – κολάν, που άφηνε εκτεθειμένα τα ευαίσθητα σημεία του σώματός της – τα οποία και δεν προσπάθησε να κρύψει.
Στο πάνω μέρος, φορούσε μία μπεζ γούνα, ενώ δεν φαινόταν να υπάρχει μπλούζα, πουκάμισο ή σουτιέν κάτω από αυτήν.
Ο 46χρονος Kanye εθεάθη να την ακολουθεί, προχωρώντας πίσω από την σύζυγό του μαζί με την ομάδα ασφαλείας τους, ενώ, σε αντίθεση με εκείνην, πραγματοποίησε μια ολόμαυρη εμφάνιση, που συνοδευόταν και από μαύρα γάντια.
Το ζευγάρι δείπνησε στο εστιατόριο Ferdi, αφού πέρασε την ημέρα για ψώνια στο κατάστημα Fendi στο Παρίσι.
Πάντως, η εμφάνιση της Bianca Censori έρχεται μόλις λίγες μέρες μετά από το αποκαλυπτικό outfit που επέλεξε στην Εβδομάδα Μόδας στο Μιλάνο, που, επίσης, είχε προκαλέσει σάλο.
Αντιμέτωπη με ποινές η Bianca Censori;
Σύμφωνα με αναφορές στα διεθνή ΜΜΕ, το γεγονός ότι η Censori ήταν σχεδόν γυμνή, ενδέχεται να την φέρει αντιμέτωπη με ποινές λόγω της γαλλικής νομοθεσίας.
«Η εκ προθέσεως σεξουαλική επίδειξη ενώπιον άλλων σε χώρο προσιτό στο κοινό τιμωρείται με φυλάκιση ενός έτους και πρόστιμο εκατό χιλιάδων φράγκων [€15,000]», αναφέρει το άρθρο 222-32 του ποινικού κώδικα.
Ωστόσο, δεν έχει γίνει σαφές εάν, όντως, κινδυνεύει με πρόστιμο ή φυλάκιση λόγω της γυμνής εμφάνισής της.",2024-02-28T16:49:13Z,https://www.news247.gr,NEWS 24/7
Kanye West sued by Donna Summer's estate for 'stealing' track 'I Feel Love',"This might be his last dance.
Kanye West was sued by the estate of the late singer Donna Summer after the rapper used a sample of the late Queen of Disco’s 1977 hit “I Feel Love” without permission.
According to court documents obtained by The Post, West, 46, approached the Summer estate and requested to use the sample for his track “Good (Don’t Die)” but was denied.

A representative for West was told they were denied because there was a danger of “potential degradation to Summer’s legacy” as “West is known as a controversial public figure whose conduct has led numerous brands and business partners to disassociate from him.”
The estate says that despite permission being “explicitly denied,” West and his collaborator Ty Dolla $ign went ahead and used the track anyway.
“In the face of this rejection, Defendants arrogantly and unilaterally decided they would simply steal ‘I Feel Love’ and use it without permission,” the 16-page document states. “In their song ‘Good (Don’t Die)’ Defendants re-recorded almost verbatim the key, memorable portions of Summer’s iconic song, used it as the hook for their own song and released it to the public knowing they had tried and failed to secure legal permission from its rightful owners and had no legal right to do so.”
The document also states that West’s song, which was released as a part of his highly anticipated “Vultures 1” album, was “instantly recognized” as a “blatant rip-off” of Summer’s tune.
Since the lawsuit, several music streamers “took down the infringing song in acknowledgment of Plaintiff’s intellectual property rights” but have otherwise left the rest of the album untouched.

Additionally, the estate is seeking an injunction against West to block any further distribution of the infringing song.

Seems like someone didn’t pack enough panties.
While most people go overboard on the undies while traveling, Bianca Censori seemed to go the opposite route while attending Paris Fashion Week Tuesday night, stepping out in a pair of sheer black tights with nothing underneath as she was spotted outside the Ritz hotel with husband Kanye West.
The Yeezy architect, 29, is known for her tights-as-pants aesthetic, but this time she took it to the next level by going commando under her sheer black tights, which she paired with a cropped fur jacket by Prototypes that appeared to read “Daily” on the back.

Her crotch and butt were both on full display as she walked into the hotel with the “Gold Digger” rapper, 46, who dressed in one of his typical baggy all-black ensembles.
Censori — who recently had bangs cut into her short hair — wore her dark locks slicked back for the night, wearing several silver rings but otherwise going accessory-free to let her bare outfit do the talking.
She also sported minimal makeup for the evening, wearing just a hint of taupe eyeshadow and nude lipstick for their dinner date at celeb hotspot (and Kim Kardashian fave) Ferdi.

On Monday, she went with another no pants, no problem look, wearing a tight blue top and a pair of sheer black pantyhose to head on a shopping date with the “Flashing Lights” rapper.
Her risqué looks follow a more modest ensemble the Australian beauty wore on Sunday night while out in Paris with stepdaughter North West, 10.
Censori wore her husband’s oversized Balenciaga jacket with a pair of black tights (presumably with underwear) as she headed to McDonald’s and Popeyes with West’s eldest daughter, whom he shares with Kim Kardashian, 43.

She also sported a black bodysuit without pants while attending Marni’s Milan Fashion Week show — and baring bits of her undercarriage in the process.

"Donna Summer's estate sues Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign, accusing artists of illegally using ""I Feel Love""","Estate of Donna Summer sues Kanye West for copyright infringement Estate of Donna Summer sues Kanye West for copyright infringement 00:17
The estate of Donna Summer sued the artists Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and Ty Dolla $ign on Tuesday for what its attorneys say is the ""shamelessly"" illegal use of her 1977 song ""I Feel Love"" in their collaboration ""Good (Don't Die).""
The copyright infringement lawsuit was filed in federal court in Los Angeles by Summer's husband Bruce Sudano in his capacity as executor of the estate of the singer-songwriter and ""Disco Queen,"" who died in 2012.
The suit alleges that when representatives of Ye sought permission for use of the song they were rejected because the Summer estate ""wanted no association with West's controversial history.""

The suit contends that the album instead ""shamelessly"" includes re-recorded parts of the song that were ""instantly recognizable.""
""In the face of this rejection,"" the suit says, ""defendants arrogantly and unilaterally decided they would simply steal 'I Feel Love' and use it without permission.""
An email from the Associated Press seeking comment from representatives for Ye was not immediately returned.
A representative for Summer's estate told CBS News that they didn't have any additional comment to provide.
""At this time we are letting the complaint speak for itself,"" the rep said.
""I Feel Love,"" co-written by Summer, Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, is a hugely influential track off Summer's album ""I Remember Yesterday"" that is considered one of the first instances of electronic dance music. The concept album had songs representing different decades. ""I Feel Love,"" with Summer's ecstatic moans and minimalist lyrics, was meant to represent the future.

""Good (Don't Die)"" was released Feb. 10 on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign's collaborative album, ""About Vultures 1."" The lawsuit names as defendants both artists and Ye's record label Yeezy.
The estate first publicly alleged the copyright violation in an Instagram post on the official Summer account on the day of the album's release.
It seeks a judge's injunction stopping any further circulation of the song, and money damages to be determined at trial.
The song does not currently appear on the version of the album available on Spotify and other streaming services.",2024-02-28T15:34:00Z,https://www.cbsnews.com,CBS News
Kanye West sued by Donna Summer's estate over 'stealing' from I Feel Love,"Kanye West is being sued by the estate of the late US singer Donna Summer for allegedly ""stealing"" parts of her music for his new album.
It comes after Ozzy Osbourne said earlier this month he refused West permission to use a Black Sabbath sample because he's an ""antisemite"" - but claims the rapper used it anyway.
The lawsuit says West asked for permission to sample from Summer's hit song I Feel Love - and engaged in ""blatant theft"" after Summer's estate ""explicitly denied"" the request.
Ty Dolla $ign - real name Tyrone Griffin - is also named in the lawsuit filed in California by Summer's husband Bruce Sudano.

It said the pair used ""instantly recognisable"" parts of Summer's song in their new track Good (Don't Die), despite their proposal being rejected due to West's ""controversial history"".
The court documents suggest the Summer estate was approached on 31 January to request clearance of the song. This was denied, but the album was released a week later on 10 February.
During this time, representatives for West and Griffin approached Summer's record label to request clearance of the master recording of the song, which was also denied, court documents allege.
The song was streamed ""millions of times"" before platforms including Spotify, iTunes and Apple Music were able to remove it, while West and Griffin have performed the song at recorded live concerts with clips online watched millions of times.

The estate is requesting maximum damages, equating to $150,000 (£118,000) ""for each act of infringement"".
""It is about protecting Donna Summer's own musical legacy and one of popular music's most influential and ground-breaking songs,"" the court documents said.
Summer, a five-time Grammy winner, died in 2012 at the age of 63 and was post-humorously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a year after her death.

Créditos: X/@yepoland
Bianca Censori, arquitecta de Yeezy y actual pareja del famoso rapero Kanye West, podría enfrentarse a sanciones legales en París tras desafiar las normativas de decencia pública con un polémico atuendo. Durante un paseo público junto a West, Censori optó por un conjunto extremadamente revelador, prescindiendo de ropa interior bajo unas medias traslúcidas y cubriéndose del frío con un abrigo de piel, lo que generó un gran revuelo entre los transeúntes que no dudaron en capturar el momento.

El escandaloso conjunto, que además parece hacer referencia a la portada del más reciente álbum de Kanye West, Vultures, podría suponer un conflicto con las leyes francesas de decencia, específicamente con el artículo 222-32 del nuevo código penal, vigente desde marzo de 1994, que sanciona la exhibición sexual deliberada ante terceros en lugares públicos con hasta un año de cárcel y una multa de €15,000 euros (USD 16215.08 dólares). Cabe destacar que la normativa distingue entre nudismo e indecencia, excluyendo de sanción a quienes practiquen el naturismo en áreas designadas para tal fin.
Fanáticos aseguran que el escandaloso conjunto de Bianca Censori está inspirado en la portada del nuevo álbum de Kanye West, ""Vultures""
Este no es el primer episodio en el que Censori se arriesga enfrentarse a la justicia por su vestimenta. Previamente, durante un viaje a Italia con Kanye West, ya había causado controversia por su elección de ropa, calificada por algunos locales como “irrespetuosa” y “poco modesta”, lo que incluso llevó a una investigación policial y a que los locales pidieran la extradición de la famosa pareja. Las leyes italianas también contemplan multas y penas de cárcel para quien se exhiba de manera impropia en presencia de menores.

Las polémicas de la pareja han llegado a salpicar a Kim Kardashian, ex-esposa del rapero. Fuentes cercanas han mencionado que Kardashian ha mostrado su preocupación por el impacto de las elecciones de vestimenta de Censori en los niños, llegando a pedir a West que intervenga. Durante su paso por París, se vio a Bianca paseando junto a North West, una de las hijas de Kanye y Kim. En las imágenes que circularon en redes, Bianca utilizaba el mismo conjunto de medias transparentes apenas cubierto por una chaqueta de cuero oversize. North, por su parte, lució una playera con la palabra Vultures como promoción del nuevo disco de su padre.

Y mientras Bianca continúa escandalizando Europa, Kanye West denunció en sus redes sociales que la marca Adidas, con quien tuvo una colaboración de varios años, había comenzado una demanda contra él además de vender nuevos diseños del modelo Yeezy (creado por West) que no son de la autoría del rapero.
“No sólo están sacando colores falsos, sino que me están demandando por 250 millones de dólares y tampoco me pagan por los zapatos que están sacando y que tienen mi nombre (...) Y están utilizando cláusulas contractuales y 50 años de experiencia empresarial para violar a una artista, uno de sus artistas favoritos, justo delante de todos ustedes a plena luz del día”.

When Kim Kardashian Was 'Embarrassed' by Kanye West and Bianca Censori’s Bold Holiday Antics,"Editor's note: This article was originally published on August 30, 2023. It has since been updated.
In the never-ending complicated realm of celebrity relationships, even those that seem firmly as past chapters can resurface unexpectedly, as is the curious case of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. Despite their separation in early 2021, the controversial antics by West and his then-new wife Bianca Censori left Kim feeling ""worried"" and, at times, ""embarrassed.""

Kanye West, the Donda Rapper and Yeezy owner, has been no stranger to drawing attention. During a holiday to Italy, he was seen wandering around the streets barefoot while holding a bottle of champagne. West was accompanied by his wife, Censori, who turned heads in a nude partly transparent catsuit during their holiday escapade in Venice. The provocative outfit sparked controversy, but it seems Kim’s concern broadens beyond mere curiosity.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bianca Censori - West (@biancasensorii)
The Sun claims that a source close to the SKIMS founder has revealed that “Kim's been so worried about the new pics that have come out with Bianca - like how will she explain it all to the kids?” The source added, ""She's embarrassed and worried for him - he's wandering around barefoot with champagne in the street, something isn't right.""
Elaborating on Kim's state of mind, the source continued, “It's hard for her because as soon as she thinks she can move on, something like this happens and she's pulled back into it. It's like every time Kanye and Bianca pull these nearly-naked stunts, it reminds everyone that Kim dressed up in skintight nude outfits during the marriage.” The pair share four children, and Kim is reportedly worried about the impact of such antics on their kids.

Bianca's fashion choices during their Italian vacation have also drawn attention and raised eyebrows. Her nearly-naked ensembles have sparked complaints from local citizens, who have labeled her outfits as ""indecent."" In Italy, where conservative values are deeply rooted, acts contrary to public decency can carry hefty fines. Some critics have gone as far as suggesting that she should be fined for her attire, with calls for her to respect the cultural norms of the country they are visiting.

While Kim may be attempting to move forward with her life post-divorce, the media spotlight has a way of pulling her back into the whirlwind of her past. Despite their separation, it's evident that the legacy of Kim and Kanye's relationship continues to play a role in both of their lives. As they each navigate new chapters, they are reminded that the echoes of their shared history still have the power to captivate the public's attention.

In a world where privacy is a rare commodity for celebrities, the struggles and emotions that come with high-profile divorces can be all too relatable.

Mit wenig Textil und viel Haut präsentiert sich die Yeezy-Architektin in Begleitung ihres berühmten Partners den Kameras. Dem Rapper scheint der Look seiner Liebsten zu gefallen – doch geht sie nun zu weit? Kanye shoppt mit seiner leicht bekleideten Bianca in Paris.
Wie Fotos, die Mail Online vorliegen, zeigen, hat die australische Schönheit wohl einen Umweg um die Unterwäscheschublade gemacht. Mit einer kurzen Felljacke – darunter ein Shirt – und einer durchsichtigen Strumpfhose verlässt sie mit Kanye im Schlepptau das Auto. Daraufhin bummeln der ""I Love It""-Interpret und seine Frau in einem Hauch von Nichts durch ein Modegeschäft.
Vor den Kindern ihres Auserwählten, die er mit seiner Ex-Frau Kim Kardashian (43) hat, trägt die Brünette allerdings ganz normales Looks – die mutmaßliche Ansage der Mutter hat offenbar gefruchtet. Als Bianca kürzlich mit North West (10) durch Paris schlenderte, trug sie eine oversized Lederjacke, ein lockeres Sweatshirt und eine dunkle Strumpfhose.

Donna Summers dödsbo stämmer Kanye West,"Du vet väl att du kan skapa ett gratiskonto på DN? Som inloggad kan du ta del av flera smarta funktioner.
Kanye West ska ha bett om dödsboets tillåtelse att använda låten, en begäran som dock avslogs. Artisten struntade dock i detta och använde låten ändå.
”I feel love” samplades på låten ”Good (Don't die)”, som fanns med på hans nya album ”Vultures 1” som i början av februari släpptes på flera strömningstjänster. Albumet försvann nyligen från nätet, för att kort därpå dyka upp igen utan låten.
Kanye West befinner sig i en liknande konflikt med rockstjärnan Ozzy Osbourne, detta efter att ha samplat en Osbournelåt från 1983 på releasefesten för ”Vultures 1”.
West – som numera kallar sig Ye – har flera gånger pekats ut för antisemitiska uttalanden, vilket kulminerade när han 2022 medverkade i högernationalisten Alex Jones podcast och uttryckte sin beundran för Adolf Hitler. Då avbröt flera klädmärken sina samarbeten med artisten och han droppades också av sitt skivbolag.

"Kanye West, demandado por los herederos de Donna Summer","Nueva polémica para Kanye West. Apenas unos días después de su nuevo rifirrafe con Adidas, ahora son los herederos de Donna Summer quienes quieren llevar a los tribunales al rapero por haber utilizado sin autorización una conocida canción de la diva en uno de los temas de su último disco, Vultures I, después de que estos se la negaran.
Según los documentos obtenidos por el portal de noticias TMZ, la demanda va dirigida contra Ye, así como contra Ty Dolla $ign, el sello discográfico del artista y otros implicados en el single, que ya no está disponible en las plataformas digitales.
Explican los herederos que el músico ha utilizado un sample —un extracto de una canción que sirve como base para uno nuevo— de uno de los mayores éxitos de Summer, I Feel Love, para la pista Good (Don't Die), la cual se incluyó en el álbum solo al comienzo de su salida al mercado el pasado 10 de febrero.
Agregan, además, que hay una gran predominancia en la canción de la voz de Summer a pesar de que fueron explícitos a la hora de negarle el permiso para que la utilizase. Tal y como detallan en la demanda, presentada por su abogado, Larry Stein, Kanye les hizo el requerimiento recientemente, el pasado 31 de enero, apenas algo más de una semana antes de la fecha en que quería lanzar el disco.
Según la demanda, sus herederos fueron rotundos a la hora de decirle que no pero, a pesar de este rechazo —ellos controlan parte de los derechos de autor de la música de Summer—, Good (Don't Die) apareció en Apple, en Spotify y en otras importantes plataformas de streaming.
No explicitan la razón de su negativa —presumiblemente por las controvertidas declaraciones antisemitas, racistas y misóginas del músico— y apostillan que Ye intentó eludir este rechazo creando una interpolación de la canción de Donna en lugar de la pista real. Es decir, regrabando él mismo la melodía que quería.
Aun así, los herederos de Donna puntualizan que dicha solución no le protege de la infracción de derechos de autor, por lo que tuvieron que ser ellos quienes hablaron con Apple, Spotify y el resto de plataformas para exigirles que retiraran la canción de Kanye.
Sin embargo, como el tema de Ye ya tenía más varios millones de reproducciones —más de ocho solo en Spotify— alegan que han resultado perjudicados y solicitan una indemnización por daños y perjuicios, así como una orden judicial que impida una nueva distribución de la canción.",2024-02-28T10:34:42Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos
"""Song einfach gestohlen"": Donna Summers Erben verklagen Rapper Kanye West","Kanye West (46) hat in den vergangenen Jahren nicht nur mit Musik für Aufsehen gesorgt, sondern vor allem mit problematischen Äußerungen polarisiert, seine antisemitischen Aussagen kosteten den Rapper unter anderem seinen Vertrag mit Adidas. Jetzt steht West neuer Ärger ins Haus: Die Erben der 2012 verstorbenen Pop-Ikone Donna Summer gehen gegen den Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian vor und verklagen ihn und Ty Dolla $ign (41) wegen der Verwendung von Summers Song „I Feel Love“ im Track „Good (Don't Die)“ auf ihrem Album „Vultures 1“.
Dokumente, die dem US-Branchenblatt „People“ vorliegen, belegen, dass die Erben der verstorbenen Pop-Ikone am Dienstag vor einem kalifornischen Bundesgericht Klage wegen Urheberrechtsverletzung gegen die beiden Rapper eingereicht haben. Die Klage basiert auf der Behauptung, dass Summers „I Feel Love“ unerlaubt in ihrem Track verwendet wurde. Hauptkläger ist der Ehemann der „Queen of Disco“, Bruce Sudano. Die Verwendung des Liedes aus dem Jahre 1977 sei laut Sudano ausdrücklich verweigert worden.
„Arrogant und einseitig“: So lauten die Vorwürfe gegen Kanye West
Am Tag der Veröffentlichung des Albums postete Sudano auf X (früher Twitter): „Kanye West hat um Erlaubnis gebeten, Donna Summers Song 'I Feel Love' zu verwenden, und es wurde ihm verweigert ... er hat den Text geändert, ihn von jemandem neu singen lassen oder AI verwendet, aber es ist 'I Feel Love' ... Urheberrechtsverletzung!!!“
„Arrogant und einseitig“: So lauten die Vorwürfe gegen Kanye West
Die Musiker hätten „arrogant und einseitig“ beschlossen, „den Song einfach zu stehlen“. Schließlich hätten die Erben die Anfrage der Rapper abgelehnt, weil sie „keine Verbindung zu Wests kontroverser Geschichte haben wollten“. Darüber hinaus behauptet der Kläger, dass die Rapper „ihren Song bereits fertiggestellt und für die Veröffentlichung vorbereitet hatten, ohne die Erlaubnis einzuholen oder Summer Estate überhaupt von der Verwendung zu benachrichtigen“. Den Unterlagen ist zu entnehmen, dass Sudano und seine Mitkläger ganze 150.000 Dollar für jede Rechtsverletzung fordern.
Die Anwälte betonen in dem schriftlichen Statement, dass es vor allem „um den Schutz von Donna Summers eigenem musikalischen Vermächtnis und einem der einflussreichsten und bahnbrechendsten Songs der Popmusik“ gehe. Auch Ozzy Osbourne erhob zuletzt ähnliche Vorwürfe gegen West. Denn der Rapper hatte für „Vultures 1“ auch ein Sample einer Liveversion des Black-Sabbbath-Stücks „Iron Man“ verwendet - und das, obwohl Osbourne ihm die Nutzung explizit untersagt hatte.

Kanye West contro Adidas: “Vendete Yeezy false e non mi pagate: state abusando di me”,"Il rapper di Atlanta ha nuovamente criticato Adidas dopo che l'azienda di abbigliamento sportivo ha proseguito con il rilascio di ciò che lui chiama “le Yeezy 350 fake”. Il motivo per cui le definisce “fake” è perché lui afferma che si tratti di un design non autorizzato
Kanye West si scaglia ancora una volta contro Adidas, sostenendo quanto segue: “Vendete Yeezy false e non mi pagate: state abusando di me”.
Queste sono le parole del rapper di Atlanta, il quale ha nuovamente criticato la famosa azienda di abbigliamento sportivo (di cui lui era partner prima dello scandalo delle magliette con la scritta ""White Lives Matter"", indossate da lui e da Candace Owens, autrice nera nota per il suo sostegno a Trump e critica del movimento ""Black Livers Matter"", in occasione della presentazione di una collezione di moda dell'ex marito di Kim Kardashian alla settimana della moda di Parigi nel 2022).
West torna dunque a criticare Adidas dopo che questa ha proseguito con il rilascio di ciò che lui chiama “le Yeezy 350 fake”. Il motivo per cui le definisce “fake” è perché lui afferma che si tratta di un design non autorizzato.
West - che ora si dovrebbe chiamare Ye come da sua richiesta (si è fatto cambiare il nome) ma che si continua a chiamare Kanye West, e del resto pure lui su Instagram continua a scegliere ""Kanye West"" come nome profilo - è venuto a conoscenza dei piani di Adidas di approvare le ""Steel Grey"" 350 V2 con i suoi design e ha pubblicamente criticato il suo ex partner commerciale su Instagram. In fondo a questo articolo potete guardare il video condiviso nelle scorse ore da Kanye West sul suo profilo ufficiale di Instagram.
West ai suoi follower ""chiede essenzialmente un boicottaggio” di Adidas Sul social network in cui il rapper conta 19,8 milioni di follower, la star si è espressa direttamente ai suoi seguaci lunedì 26 febbraio, “chiedendo essenzialmente un boicottaggio”, come hanno commentato nelle scorse ore i giornalisti Michael Saponara e Bill Donahue su un articolo pubblicato dall’edizione americana del magazine Billboard. ""Chiunque ami Ye non dovrebbe comprare queste Yeezy false. Non ho mai realizzato questi colori, non sto guadagnando nulla e Adidas mi sta citando in giudizio"", ha scritto in una lunga didascalia accanto a uno screenshot di una foto delle scarpe. ""Tutte le nuove 350 non autorizzate sono brutte, tutti sanno che le 350 sono brutte”, ha aggiunto West.

Kanye West su Adidas: “Mi stanno citando in giudizio per 250 milioni di dollari”
Poco dopo lo screenshot della scarpa che il rapper di Atlanta definisce ""brutta"", oltre che “fake”, Ye ha pubblicato un video su Instagram in cui spiega - dal suo punto di vista - la sua disputa con Adidas. Ha affermato che l'azienda lo sta citando in giudizio mentre cerca di vendere la sua linea Yeezy. ""Non solo stanno producendo colori falsi non autorizzati: mi stanno citando in giudizio per 250 milioni di dollari e non mi stanno pagando per queste scarpe che stanno mettendo in vendita con il mio nome"", ha dichiarato, parlando attraverso la sua protesi dentaria in titanio. Come fanno sapere i giornalisti Michael Saponara e Bill Donahue, Adidas non ha risposto alla richiesta di commento da parte della rivista Billboard. Ma perché queste parole di Ye proprio ora? Semplice: queste dichiarazioni del rapper statunitense arrivano dopo che Adidas ha annunciato lunedì scorso che avrebbe venduto parte del suo rimanente inventario Yeezy. “Un problema complicato per l'azienda dopo la separazione da Ye nel 2022 a seguito della sua serie di dichiarazioni di odio e antisemite”, si legge su Billboard. Dopo la fine della partnership, Adidas afferma di aver devoluto parte del ricavato da tali vendite a gruppi che ""combattono la discriminazione e l'odio, compresi il razzismo e l'antisemitismo"".

Adidas e un caso di arbitrato privato contro la Yeezy LLC di West nel dicembre 2022 Al momento, come fa notare Billboard, non ci sono prove che Adidas abbia presentato una nuova causa legale contro West o le sue aziende.
Tuttavia, ricordiamo che l'anno scorso Adidas ha rivelato di aver presentato un caso di arbitrato privato contro la Yeezy LLC di West. È accaduto nel dicembre 2022, quando l’azienda di abbigliamento sportivo ha sostenuto che le ""dichiarazioni e comportamenti pubblici razzisti, antisemiti e offensivi"" di West avrebbero violato l'accordo di partnership e causato ""danni considerevoli al suo marchio"". Quando l'altroieri West ha sostenuto che Adidas lo starebbe ""citando in giudizio"", magari si riferiva proprio a quel caso di arbitrato. Non è chiaro se i “250 milioni di dollari” di cui parla il rapper siano quelli richiesti in quel caso specifico - né è chiaro se il caso sia ancora in corso o meno - poiché le procedure arbitrali si tengono a porte chiuse.

E pensare che c'è chi credeva che si stesse per giungere a una riconciliazione... Sembrava esserci una possibile via verso la riconciliazione tra Ye e Adidas dopo che, la scorsa settimana, il rapper è stato fotografato mentre incontrava il CEO dell'azienda, Bjorn Gulden. Ma sembra che non sia più possibile nessun tipo di riconciliazione, a questo punto… L'azienda ha iniziato a vendere nuovamente prodotti Yeezy nel maggio 2023 dopo aver interrotto i legami con la star del rap da stelle e strisce. Billboard riporta che l’azienda “ha cercato di congelare 75 milioni di dollari di fondi Yeezy nel suo conto bancario”, ma un giudice ha “annullato l'ordine di congelare i fondi una settimana dopo”.

Kanye West sued by estate of Donna Summer over ‘stealing’ I Feel Love,"The estate of the late Donna Summer has filed a lawsuit against Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign, alleging that the musicians “decided they would simply steal” her song I Feel Love, “and use it without permission” on their album Vultures.
The lawsuit is being brought by Bruce Sudano, Summer’s widower and executor of her estate. It states that the pair were not authorised to use I Feel Love for their song Good (Don’t Die), which has been removed from streaming services following an earlier complaint by the Summer estate.
The lawsuit states that West and Ty Dolla $ign requested to sample I Feel Love in January, before the release of Vultures on 10 February. The estate turned down the request, citing “the immense commercial value of the I Feel Love composition, but also the potential degradation to Summer’s legacy. West is known as a controversial public figure whose conduct has led numerous brands and business partners to disassociate from him … the Summer estate sought to protect the valuable intellectual property … from any public association with the negative publicity surrounding West” – a reference to how Adidas, Gap and others cut ties with West after he made antisemitic comments in 2022.
The lawsuit claims that West and Ty Dolla $ign then sought permission via Universal Music Group, but were again denied. It adds: “In the face of these repeated denials, West and co-defendants attempted to get around this roadblock by instead making an unauthorised interpolation. West and his co-defendants used the song’s iconic melody as the hook for their infringing song and essentially re-recorded almost verbatim key, instantly recognisable portions of I Feel Love using a singer soundalike to Summer, with slight changes to the lyrics (also done without permission).”
The plaintiffs claim the suit is “about more than defendants’ mere failure to pay the appropriate licensing fee for using another’s musical property. It is also about the rights of artists to decide how their works are used and presented to the public, and the need to prevent anyone from simply stealing creative works when they cannot secure the right to use them legally.”
West and Ty Dolla $ign have not commented on the lawsuit. The Guardian has requested comment via their press representative.
Vultures was beset with other issues prior to release. Ozzy Osbourne said he refused permission for West to sample Black Sabbath “because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many”; Nicki Minaj blocked the release of the song New Body which she featured on and which had previously leaked, saying: “Why would I put out a song that has been out for three years?” It was also frequently delayed from an initial 15 December release date.

Donna Summer's Estate is Suing Kanye West for Unauthorized Music Sampling,"On Tuesday, the estate of Donna Summer filed a lawsuit against Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign, claiming that their Vultures 1 album track Good (Don't Die) illegally used her 1977 song I Feel Love. The rapper reportedly requested to utilize a portion of the song on his album Vultures 1 album in January 2024, but he was eventually turned down, according to court records that TMZ was able to get on Tuesday. According to the site, the estate, which is still in possession of some copyright, says that West's prior controversy is the reason they turned down his request.

On Tuesday, the song—which has amassed over 8 million plays—was inaccessible on Spotify due to an error notice stating, ""This content is not available."" One of the most important songs from Summer's album I Remember Yesterday is I Feel Love, which she co-wrote with Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. It is regarded as one of the first examples of electronic dance music. The song I Feel Love, with Summer's blissful sighs and spare words, was intended to symbolize the times ahead. On the day of the album's release, Summer's official Instagram Story was updated with a copyright infringement claim made by the estate for the first time. According to Page Six, the rapper ""asked permission"" to use the song, but it was ""denied.""Then he ""changed the words, had someone re-sing it or used AI."" ""Copyright infringement!!!"" was added to the post.

A few weeks ago, Ozzy Osbourne said that he was thinking of taking Ye to court after the rapper claimed to have copied a Black Sabbath song in Vultures, Volume 1. In a tweet on February 9 on X Osbourne said, ""[Kanye] asked permission to sample a section of a 1983 live performance of 'Iron Man' from the US festival without vocals & was refused permission because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many."" He further added, ""[Ye] went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night. I want no association with this man!"". Ye and Ty Dolla $ign performed songs from the album on February 8 at Chicago's United Center, according to Billboard. The ""Iron Man"" sample was used in the song ""Carnival"" in videos from the event that were shared on social media, however, it is absent from the Spotify version of the song.

For West, who has been sued several times for unlawfully sampling or interpolating in his songs, these accusations are nothing new. He was sued in 2022 for allegedly illegally sampling a song by the groundbreaking rap group Boogie Down Productions in his song Life of the Party. He was also sued in another case for allegedly using a clipped portion of Marshall Jefferson's 1986 house track Move Your Body in the song Flowers. Finally, he was sued in a different case by a Texas pastor for allegedly using a sample from his sermon that was recorded in Come to Life.",2024-02-28T09:23:42Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
"Kanye West e în război cu Adidas. A pierdut deja 1,5 miliarde dolari","Kanye West e în război cu Adidas, după ce a pierdut 1,5 miliarde de dolari din contractul cu gigantul sportiv și acum este dat în judecată!
Artistul aduce acuzații grave brandului german și susține că ar fi inventat modele fake de „Yeezy”, propriul său concept de adidași.
Kanye West e în război cu Adidas, după ce a pierdut contractul de 1,5 miliarde de dolari! A lansat acuzații grave
În anul 2022 s-a încheiat colaborarea de lungă durată dintre Kanye West și Adidas, pe care gigantul sportiv a motivat-o folosindu-se de o serie de declarații controversate ale artistului. Momentul respectiv a cauzat o prăbușire majoră a averii lui West, care a ajuns la „doar” 400 de milioane de dolari.
Era de așteptat ca Adidas să nu mai lanseze noi modele de Yeezy după izbucnirea scandalului, dar lucrurile au luat o întorsătură după ce nemții au hotărât să comercializeze în continuare produsele și chiar unele modificate după bunul lor plac, nu realizate în felul în care erau inițial proiectate de West. Alegerea a provocat o reacție extrem de dură din partea artistului.
„Oricine îl iubește pe Ye nu ar cumpăra acești Yeezy falși. Nu am făcut niciodată aceste culori. Nu mă plătesc pentru ele și Adidas mă dă în judecată.
Toată lumea vede că am copiii mei ascunși de mine sau vede o companie Fortune 500 violând unul dintre eroii lor în viața reală. Nimeni nu spune nimic sau nu face nimic. În ceea ce privește sistemul. Ce vor face acum, să-mi descarce albumul din nou, să-mi înghețe din nou conturile, să amenințe oamenii că nu vor mai lucra cu mine? Toate noile modele 350 neaprobate sunt ridicole”, a scris Kanye West, pe contul său de Instagram.
Totodată, într-un videoclip postat pe rețelele de socializare, artistul acuză Adidas că îl dă în judecată pentru 250 de milioane de euro deși ei sunt cei care nu îl plătesc pentru comercializarea propriului său brand și, mai mult decât atât, inventează și modele fake.
„Nu doar că lansează culori fake, dar mă dau în judecată pentru 250 de milioane de dolari și nu mă plătesc pentru pantofii pe care-i lansează cu numele meu pe ei! Și se folosesc de clauze contractuale și 50 de ani de experiență în business ca să violeze un artist, unul dintre artiștii voștri preferați, chiar în fața voastră la lumina zilei”, a mai spus Kanye West.

Por que Kim teme assumir namoro com Odell Beckham Jr?
Segundo alguns meios, Kim exigiu à Ye que Bianca não ande por aí com pouca roupa, quando um de seus filhos estiver presente.
E na noite de domingo (26), a arquiteta australiana de 29 anos foi vista com a filha mais velha de Kim e Kanye, North West, em uma saída em Paris, na França, quando foram jantar.
A menina viajou com o pai para uma apresentação juntos, e Bianca cuidou de North o tempo todo, e o principal: vestindo-se de forma ‘recatada’.

"Wegen Donna Summers ""I Feel Love"": Kanye wird West verklagt","Er sorgt schon für den nächsten Skandal... Der Rapper Kanye West (46) ist momentan auf Tour und promotet sein neues Album ""Vultures"", das am 10. Februar zusammen mit seinem Kollegen Ty Dolla Sign erschienen ist. Neben den beiden Rappern ist sogar seine älteste Tochter North West (10) auf dem neuen Album vertreten. Doch nun werden Kanye und Ty aufgrund einer Urheberrechtsverletzung von Donna Summers Hinterbliebenen verklagt.
Laut Berichten von The Wrap sollen Kanye und Ty den Song ""I Feel Love"" von der Disco-Ikone in ihrem ""Good (Don't Die)"" verwendet haben. Donnas Ehemann Bruce Sudano behauptete, dass die beiden angefragt hätten, den Song zu verwenden, er dies aber abgelehnt habe. ""Summers Verwandtschaft wollte keine Verbindung zu Wests kontroverser Geschichte und lehnte die von West vorgeschlagene Verwendung von Summers 'I Feel Love' ausdrücklich ab"", heißt es in der Klage. Kanye setzte sich dem wohl entgegen. Trotzdem ist ""Good (Don't Die)"" derzeit nicht mehr zum Streamen verfügbar.
Doch nicht nur Kanye sorgt gerne mal für Aufregung. Erst kürzlich zog seine Frau Bianca Censori wieder alle Blicke auf sich. Wie unter anderem TMZ zeigte, präsentierte sich die Yeezy-Architektin auf dem Konzert ihres Mannes in Mailand wieder in einem freizügigen Look. Seit ihrer Ehe mit dem ""Gold Digger""-Interpreten ist dies aber keine Seltenheit mehr.

Donna Summers ektemann saksøker Kanye West og Ty Dolla $ign,"Mener rapperne har brukt den avdøde discodronningens låt «I Feel Love» uten tillatelse.
Søksmålet gjelder låten «Good Don’t Die» på Kanye Wests og Ty Dolla $igns nye samarbeidsalbum «Vultures 1». Låten er ikke tilgjengelig på Spotify nå.
Donna Summer, som døde i 2012, hadde en rekke disco-hits på 1970-tallet, blant annet «Hot Stuff» og nevnte «I feel Love», som ble utgitt i 1977.
Donna Summers ektemann Bruce Sudano, som forvalter hennes eiendommer og musikkrettigheter, står bak søksmålet.
Det er sendt inn til retten i Los Angeles tirsdag, skriver AP. Her hevdes det at Kanye West og Ty Dolla $ign har brukt deler av låten «I Feel Love» på «Good Don’t Die» – uten tillatelse.

I søksmålet hevdes det at representanter for Kanye West ba om lov til å bruke låten, men at de fikk nei. Forvalterne av Donna Summers eiendommer ønsket ikke å bli assosiert med rapperen på grunn av hans «kontroversielle historie», skriver de.
I sin nye låt har Kanye West, som også omtales som Ye, og Ty Dolla $ign likevel brukt nyinnspillinger av deler av låten, hevdes det i søksmålet.
De to rapperne omtales som både «skamløse» og «arrogante», og anklages for å ha stjålet låten.

Rapper Kanye West Accuses Adidas of Misusing His Brand and Doling Out Fake Yeezys,"Kanye West, also known as Ye, has once more criticized Adidas for moving forward with releasing what he deems to be ""fake"" Yeezy 350s, asserting that they are an unauthorized design. In a recent Instagram video, West openly accused Adidas of this action. He said that they are “using contract clauses and 50 years of business experience to rape an artist.” The Daily Beast reported that he also alleged the company is suing him for $250 million. West took to Instagram to publicly criticize his former business partner while also urging for a boycott.

In the video, he said, “Let me explain really clear to you guys what’s happening with Adidas. Not only are they putting out fake colorways that are non-approved, they’re suing me for $250 million, and they’re also not paying me for these shoes that they’re putting out that have my name on it. And they’re using contract clauses and 50 years of business experience to rape an artist, one of y’all favorite artists, right in front of y’all in broad daylight.” Furthermore, he shared a separate post displaying the Yeezy 350s that Adidas is currently selling. Along with the screenshot of the footwear, he wrote an extensive caption.
West wrote, “Anybody who loves Ye would not buy these fake Yeezys I never made these color ways I’m not getting paid off of them and adidas is suing me. ... All the new non approved 350’s are cooorny.” His comments followed Adidas' announcement on Monday that they would be selling off the remaining Yeezy inventory. This posed a dilemma for the company after parting ways with West in 2022 due to his series of hate speech and antisemitic remarks. Adidas has stated that since ending their partnership, they have contributed some proceeds from these sales to organizations dedicated to fighting discrimination and hate, according to Billboard.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ye (@kanyewest)
West's accusation against Adidas, comparing it to ""rape,"" is not a new thing. In 2022, shortly after the clothing giant declared its intention to reassess its partnership with West, he made a post. He wrote, “FUUUUUUCK ADIDAS I AM ADIDAS ADIDAS RAPED AND STOLE MY DESIGNS.” However, in an announcement, Adidas said, “Adidas is the sole owner of all design rights to existing products as well as previous and new colorways under the partnership.” In the past year, Adidas earned $813 million from two distinct releases of Yeezy inventory after ending its partnership with West.

There seemed to be a potential path to reconciliation between West and Adidas after the rapper was seen meeting with the company's CEO, Bjorn Gulden, last week. However, it appears that reconciliation is no longer on the table. Meanwhile, as reported by Business Insider, Adidas stated earlier this month that they have approximately $300 million worth of Yeezy stock remaining. The majority of the proceeds from the sale of this stock would be allocated to various charities, including the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change, according to Adidas. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest that Adidas has initiated any new legal action against West or his companies.",2024-02-28T02:46:10Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

She paired the see-through leggings with a skintight three-quarter-sleeve top, which seemingly had an autograph on one shoulder.

Censori, 29, went braless under the revealing blue shirt as she and the controversial rapper, 46, checked out some of the designer duds before leaving the store arm-in-arm.
She accessorized the eye-catching ensemble with a simple pair of black, sling-back heels and kept her short tresses slicked back to show off her minimal makeup.
The “Heartless” rapper, for his part, opted for his typical all-black outfit consisting of sweatpants, a hoodie and an oversized windbreaker.
He notably wore a pair of Nike gloves amid his ongoing drama with Adidas, which he recently accused of releasing “fake” Yeezy sneakers despite cutting ties in October 2022.

The duo was spotted walking hand-in-hand through the streets of Paris following the 10-year-old’s appearance at her dad’s “Vultures 1” release party.
While Censori kept her usual tights-as-pants trend going, she donned a more modest top, using an oversized black leather Balenciaga jacket as a dress.

During this time, representatives for West and Griffin approached Summer's record label to request clearance of the master recording of the song, which was also denied, court documents allege.

"Gli eredi di Donna Summer contro Kanye West, ha rubato I Feel Love","Kanye West fa arrabbiare gli eredi di Donna Summer. Secondo un'azione legale, il rapper è accusato di aver rubato 'I Feel Love', hit del 1977 della defunta cantautrice statunitense. Il brano in questione è 'Good (Don't Die)', in collaborazione con Ty Dolla $ign. Bruce Sudano, vedovo della Summer, sostiene che più volte è stato negato l'utilizzo della canzone. Di fronte all'ennesimo No, i due artisti hanno deciso di aggirare i rifiuti attraverso quello che è definito 'interpolation' senza autorizzazione. ""Di fronte ai ripetuti rifiuti - si legge nei documenti legali - West e il suo coimputato hanno cercato di aggirare il blocco attraverso un interpolation non autorizzato. Hanno usato l'iconica melodia della canzone come motivo per la loro canzone violante e sostanzialmente hanno registrato nuovamente alla lettera la tonalità, parti di I Feel Love sono riconoscibili all'istante con l'utilizzo di una cantante che ha la voce simile a quella di Summer. Sono stati fatti anche dei sottili cambiamenti al testo, ugualmente senza autorizzazione"". West non ha commentato a riguardo.

Erick Sermon Says Kanye West’s Next Solo Album Will Be A Return To The Old Ye,"Erick Sermon says that he worked with Kanye West on new music in Florence, Italy, last year, and the songs the rapper was putting together sounded like the old Kanye. Reflecting on the experience during an interview with HipHopDX, Sermon explained that the tracks were separate from Ye’s work with Ty Dolla Sign on Vultures and instead, for an upcoming solo effort.
“The record I was working on wasn’t what him and Ty Dolla Sign was doing at the time,” Sermon recalled. “I was working on Y3, Ye’s solo album […] Hopefully, we can finish what we started, y’know, ’cause I had him on Hip Hop. I was like, ‘You got to rhyme and we have to do the stuff that you used to do ’cause you ill at that,’ y’know? And he listened […] I had [the old Kanye] back.”

"Kanye West Inspired J Dilla's ""Donuts,"" Young RJ Claims","Young RJ of Slum Village says Kanye West inspired J Dilla's iconic record, Donuts. Speaking with Shirley Ju, RJ recalled the video shoot for his group's 2004 song “Selfish,” on which Kanye West and John Legend are featured.

“He shows up to the video and we sitting back there. A guy named Scrap Dirty like, ‘Man, this your group and you gon’ let Kanye come through and do this? He killing the soul shit!’ Dilla’s sitting in the stands like, ‘Oh word? That’s what you think?’ He goes back… that’s when you get all the stuff that you heard on Donuts, all the soul stuff.

"Kanye West Sued By Donna Summer’s Estate Over “I Feel Love” Sample On ""Good (Don't Die)""","It’s been a whirlwind of a ride for Kanye West, who finally unveiled his joint project with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 1, earlier this month. Already, the album proved to be monumental for Ye and Ty. However, Ye now faces a new lawsuit as a result of the project. The estate of Donna Summer has filed a lawsuit against Kanye over her single, “I Feel Love,” which he sampled on Vultures 1 single, “GOOD (DON’T DIE)” without proper authorization. According to the estate, he used a soundalike to interpolate one of her songs after initially being denied his request to sample “I Feel Love.”
You’ve likely heard the song already, even though it was later removed from the album days after its release. became one of the highlights of the project, though the familiarity of “I Feel Love” is undoubtedly part of the appeal. However, Donna Summer’s team made it abundantly clear in their suit that they already denied Ye permission to use the song (apparently, he reached to clear the sample on Jan. 31) yet he attempted to find a loophole around it. Still, Summer’s estate explains that the interpolation won’t protect Ye from copyright infringement.

Donna Summer's Estate Won’t Stand For Kanye’s Antics
It really isn’t difficult to understand why the estate of the late singer, who still controls the copyright of the song, didn’t want to off on the sample. TMZ reports that this is presumably due to the string of controversy that surrounds Kanye, from his comments on George Floyd to his pro-Hitler tirades. At the end of the day, they decided that Ye’s use of her song wouldn’t be beneficial and passed up on Ye’s offer.
As for why the song is currently unavailable to stream on DSPs in certain markets, Summer’s estate said they reached out to streaming platforms to remove the song. Though streaming platforms like Apple and Spotify removed the song, it eventually returned to the tracklist. However, the song already gained millions of streams and for those who purchased the album on Apple Music, it’s apparently still available to listen to. The estate of Donna Summer is seeking major damages, along with an injunction to prevent the song from being distributed.

Kanye West Sued by Donna Summer Estate Over ‘Vultures 1’ Song,"The estate of Donna Summer filed a copyright lawsuit against Kanye West on Tuesday (Feb. 27), accusing him of “shamelessly” using her 1977 hit “I Feel Love” without permission in his song “Good (Don’t Die).”
In a complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court, Summer’s estate made good on public allegations earlier this month that claimed West had infringed the copyright to her song by interpolating it in “Good,” which he released on his chart-topping Vultures 1 album.
The estate’s attorneys say West “shamelessly used instantly recognizable portions” of her song in his track, despite the fact that her estate had already “explicitly denied” him authorization to do so.
Trending on Billboard
“Summer’s estate … wanted no association with West’s controversial history and specifically rejected West’s proposed use,” her attorneys write. “In the face of this rejection, defendants arrogantly and unilaterally decided they would simply steal ‘I Feel Love’ and use it without permission.”
The Summer estate’s lawyers say West re-recorded “almost verbatim” the key portions of her song and then used them as the hook for his own. The estate claims the songs were so similar that fans and critics “instantly recognized” Kanye’s track as a “blatant rip-off.” The lawsuit also named album collaborator Ty Dolla $ign, whose real name is Tyrone William Griffin Jr.
After the estate’s public statements earlier this month, “Good (Don’t Die)” was quickly pulled down from streaming platforms and has seemingly been removed from digital versions of the album. But the Summer estate says the damage is already done, and that legal action must be taken.
“This lawsuit is about more than Defendants’ mere failure to pay the appropriate licensing fee for using another’s musical property,” the estate’s lawyers write. “It is also about the rights of artists to decide how their works are used and presented to the public, and the need to prevent anyone from simply stealing creative works when they cannot secure the right to use them legally.”
A rep for West did not immediately return a request for comment. Ty Dolla $ign could not immediately be reached for comment.
According to Tuesday’s complaint, a group called Alien Music reached out to the estate in January on behalf of West, seeking to clear the use of Summer’s song. The group advised the estate that West had already sampled “I Feel Love” on his own song, and was thus seeking “expedited” review so he could release it imminently.
In weighing the clearance request, the Summer estate says it considered the “immense commercial value” of allowing the use of her song, but also the risk of “potential degradation to Summer’s legacy” from working with the embattled rapper, who has faced widespread condemnation since a string of antisemitic statements in 2022.
“West is known as a controversial public figure whose conduct has led numerous brands and business
partners to disassociate from him,” the estate writes. “The Summer Estate sought to protect the valuable intellectual property … from any public association with the negative publicity surrounding West.”
After that clearance request was “unambiguously denied,” the estate says it was then “shocked” when it heard “Good (Don’t Die),” in which it seemed that West had attempted to “get around this roadblock” by simply making an unauthorized interpolation of the underlying music rather than sampling the recording.
Re-recording “soundalike” versions of songs is a tactic that is sometimes used by artists when an outright sample is denied, but one that is only legally viable if they’ve already secured a license to the underlying composition. In the case of Summer’s song, her estate controls the rights to that music.
“When listening to both songs, any average listener can immediately hear the distinctive similar melody and compositional elements present in both songs, which sound so identical that it appears Defendants may have gone so far as sampling the original master recording of Summer,” the estate’s lawyers write.
Tuesday’s filings confirm what had already been publicly reported by Billboard: That the Summer estate had filed formal complaints with streaming platforms, distributors and retailers, including both Spotify and Apple Music, which succeeded in getting “Good (Don’t Die)” pulled down days after it was released.
But the estate says that unauthorized song was still streamed or downloaded millions of times and that some versions are still accessible on user-uploaded sites like YouTube. They say one version, of West playing the song at a live listening party, has “over 900,000 views and counting on YouTube alone.”
Such allegations are nothing new for West, who has been repeatedly sued for illegally sampling or interpolating in his tracks.
In 2022, he was hit with a lawsuit claiming his song “Life of the Party” illegally sampled a song by the pioneering rap group Boogie Down Productions; accused in another case over allegations that he used an uncleared snippet of Marshall Jefferson’s 1986 house track “Move Your Body” in the song “Flowers”; and sued in a different case by a Texas pastor for allegedly sampling from his recorded sermon in “Come to Life.”
Before that, West and Pusha T were sued in 2019 for sampling George Jackson‘s “I Can’t Do Without You” on the track “Come Back Baby.” That same year, he was sued for allegedly using an audio snippet of a young girl praying in his 2016 song “Ultralight Beam.” Further back, West was hit with similar cases over allegedly unlicensed samples used in “New Slaves,” “Bound 2” and “My Joy.”",2024-02-27T21:00:47Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Donna Summer Estate Sues Kanye West Over Vultures 1 Song,"Bruce Sudano, the second husband of Donna Summer and the executor of the late singer’s estate, has filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign, alleging that the musicians used Summer’s “I Feel Love” without permission for their ¥$ song “Good (Don’t Die).”
Sudano filed his lawsuit in a California federal court today (February 27). He names West, Ty Dolla $ign, Yeezy Record Label LLC, the company Yzy Snd, and 10 Does as defendants.
In the complaint, Sudano alleges that, in January, an entity called Alien Music, on behalf of West and Ty Dolla $ign, reached out to Donna Summer’s estate to confirm its ownership of the “I Feel Love” composition and request permission for sampling. “In considering Defendants’ request, the Summer Estate not only considered the immense commercial value of the ‘I FEEL LOVE’ composition, but also the potential degradation to Summer’s legacy,” the complaint reads. “West is known as a controversial public figure whose conduct has led numerous brands and business partners to disassociate from him.”
Sudano claims that the estate denied the clearance request in early February, writing to the musicians’ representatives “that this denial meant an ‘absolute prohibition against any licensee (or other recording artist) covering I FEEL LOVE from using a Donna Summer “soundalike”, or using the original Donna Summer recording.’” After being denied by the estate, Sudano alleges, West and Ty Dolla $ign went to Summer’s record label, Universal Music Enterprises, for sampling permission, but the label also denied the artists’ request.
Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign released Vultures 1 in the early hours of February 10. In its original form, the album included “Good (Don’t Die),” a song that appeared to sample Summer’s “I Feel Love.” According to the complaint, it was not a sample, but “an unauthorized interpolation.” Sudano and his lawyers argue:
In the face of these repeated denials, West and Co-Defendants attempted to get around this roadblock by instead making an unauthorized interpolation. West and his Co-Defendants used the song’s iconic melody as the hook for their infringing song and essentially re-recorded almost verbatim key, instantly recognizable portions of “I FEEL LOVE” using a singer soundalike to Summer, with slight changes to the lyrics (also done without permission).
As of publication, “Good (Don’t Die)” is largely unavailable to stream, as it has been removed from most major digital streaming platforms at the request of Summer’s estate.
When reached by Pitchfork, one of Sudano’s attorneys, Stanton “Larry” Stein, offered no comment. Pitchfork has also reached out to a publicist who has worked with West and Ty Dolla $ign on the Vultures 1 campaign.",2024-02-27T21:00:06Z,https://pitchfork.com,Pitchfork
"Kanye West poursuivi par la succession de Donna Summer pour l'utilisation de ""I Feel Love"".","La succession de la légende du disco Donna Summer a déposé une plainte devant le tribunal fédéral de Californie mardi contre Ye, la star du rap anciennement connue sous le nom de Kanye West, l'accusant d'avoir incorporé son tube de 1977 ""I Feel Love"" dans son nouvel album sans autorisation.
Le procès indique que Ye et le chanteur Ty Dolla $ign ont utilisé des parties ""instantanément reconnaissables"" de la chanson dans ""Good (Don't Die)"" pour leur album collaboratif ""Vultures 1"", alors que la succession avait explicitement rejeté leur demande d'échantillonnage.
Les représentants de Ye et de Ty Dolla $ign, dont le nom de famille est Tyrone Griffin, n'ont pas pu être joints pour un commentaire. Un avocat de la succession Summer a déclaré qu'il ""laisserait la plainte parler d'elle-même"".
Ye, qui a légalement changé son nom de Kanye West en 2021, a suscité l'indignation en 2022 avec une série de messages antisémites sur les réseaux sociaux. Le rappeur s'est excusé pour ses remarques en décembre.
Ye et Griffin ont sorti ""Vultures 1"" le 10 février. Il s'agit actuellement de l'album le plus vendu aux États-Unis, selon Billboard.
La succession de Summer a déclaré qu'elle avait rejeté une demande visant à permettre à Ye et Griffin d'échantillonner ""I Feel Love"" le 3 février.
La succession de Summer a non seulement pris en compte l'immense valeur commerciale de la composition de ""I Feel Love"", mais aussi la dégradation potentielle de l'héritage de Summer"", indique la plainte. ""West est connu pour être un personnage public controversé dont la conduite a conduit de nombreuses marques et partenaires commerciaux à se dissocier de lui.
Selon la plainte, Ye et Griffin ont réenregistré l'accroche de ""I Feel Love"" avec une autre chanteuse pour leur album, malgré l'""interdiction absolue"" de la succession d'utiliser l'enregistrement de Summer ou un ""sosie"".
La succession a demandé des dommages-intérêts et a demandé au tribunal d'empêcher Ye et Griffin d'enfreindre de manière permanente les droits d'auteur de Summer.",2024-02-27T20:02:41Z,https://www.zonebourse.com,Zonebourse.com

Judi believes that Bianca's latest look is ""challenging as, unlike Bianca's notorious body stockings, this one does look accidental, as though her skirt has fallen off.""

Bianca Censori might be known for her racy looks, but she went in a more modest direction on Sunday night as she stepped out with stepdaughter North West for a one-on-one outing in Paris.
Kanye West’s 29-year-old wife headed out to both Popeyes and McDonalds with his 10-year-old daughter in tow, with the duo both wearing baggy black ‘fits for the occasion.

Censori kept her usual tights-as-pants vibe going, but borrowed her husband’s black leather Balenciaga jacket for the evening.
A similar collared bomber — which incidentally also resides in West’s closet — will set you back $6,990.
While she recently chopped long bangs into her hair, the Yeezy architect wore her locks in her typical slicked-back style and finished off her look with pointy black pumps.
The covered-up ensemble was a far cry from some of the looks Censori rocked during Milan Fashion Week last week, including an ultra-high-cut bodysuit with no pants and a sheer tank and tights that left little to the imagination.

As for North— whose mother is West’s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, 43 — she repped her dad’s new album, on which she’s featured, with a black “Vultures Volume 1” shirt and loose black pants, wearing chunky-soled black shoes.
She held hands with her stepmother as they walked down a Parisian street, and although North didn’t wear a coat she did bundle up with an enormous brown fur hat.
The trapper hat style has been worn by both North’s mom and stepmom in the past, with the “Keeping up with the Kardashians” style being accused of copying West’s new wife with her fuzzy look.

Still, while it was partially a working vacation for the pre-teen, she appeared to have some time to go on a bit of a spending spree.
According to the logos on her shopping bags, North took a moment to hit up French fashion houses Chanel and Celine — though what she scored from the stores is unknown.

The 10-year-old’s love of all things luxury is nothing new. Aside from sharing her love of skincare on TikTok and possibly even starting her own line of products, North has sat front row at high-fashion runways around the world and is often spotted wearing enviable outfits and accessories.
She even had the opportunity to snag some presents from Dior last year during her 10th birthday, after Kardashian took her to the label’s “Dioriviera” pop-up at the Beverly Hills Hotel, giving her a budget of over $1,000 for the goods.
Recently, North also showed off a set of statement-making diamond grills.

North famously critiqued her mom’s Met Gala 2023 dress prior to “The Kardashians” star hitting the red carpet.

"Esposa de Kanye West usa look coberto, após rumores de que Kim Kardashian teria exigido roupas 'mais adequadas'","A esposa de Kanye West, Bianca Censori, foi vista acompanhada de North West, sua enteada, na noite de domingo, em Paris, França. Em uma roupa que foge de seus looks ousados, que usa para sair ao lado do marido, a arquiteta usou uma jaqueta de couro plus-size. Segundo o tablóide inglês Daily Mail, a ex-mulher do rapper, a influenciadora Kim Kardashian, teria exigido que a madrasta de seus filhos usasse roupas “mais adequadas” quando estivesse perto das crianças.
Bianca e North foram vistas aproveitando o tempo juntas enquanto faziam paradas para jantar em restaurantes de fast food. A menina, de 10 anos, exibiu uma gola redonda estampada com a capa do novo álbum do pai “Vultures Volume 1”, enquanto Bianca usava uma jaqueta preta enorme sobre um vestido e meia-calça. Já a madrasta combinou o look encoberto com seus cabelos castanhos recém-tingidos, penteados para trás e maquiagem mínima.
A escolha mais recatada pode ser devido a Kim, que supostamente alertou Kanye para que sua esposa se vestisse de forma “mais adequda”, quando estivesse na companhia dos filhos do casal. As informações são do Daily Mail.
Bianca desfilou ao redor do mundo com Kanye em looks quase imperceptíveis, incluindo tops completamente transparentes exibindo seu decote sem sutiã e vestindo uma capa de chuva transparente enquanto nua por baixo. Mais recentemente, Bianca vestiu um macacão largo e sem parte de baixo, com laterais abertas que revelavam seu decote sem sutiã.
— Kim instruiu Kanye a nunca deixar Bianca se vestir assim perto das crianças — disse uma fonte com exclusividade ao Daily Mail — Ela está realmente surpresa que Kanye tenha deixado sua esposa sair de casa daquele jeito.
O casamento de Kim e Kanye rendeu quatro filhos, a mais velha North, Chicago, Saint, e Psalm.
Em dezembro, Bianca foi vista segurando Chicago nos braços enquanto saía em Miami, ela usava uma jaqueta de couro até a panturrilha e botas vermelhas. Durante o mesmo mês, Bianca foi vista com Kanye e North, vestindo um macacão creme comum, em um parque de diversões na Califórnia.
No entanto, na semana passada, Kim foi criticada depois que sua filha North compartilhou uma postagem do TikTok, agora excluída, que apresentava um desenho da madrasta Bianca em um conjunto quase nua.
Seguidores da conta conjunta de Kim e North no TikTok ficaram chocados com a publicação, que parecia ser uma lista de coisas pelas quais North estava “grata” – incluindo o polêmico novo álbum de seu pai, “Vultures 1”, que foi retirado da Apple Music, e a música “Carnival”, que contém letras pornográficas. Um fã preocupado escreveu online: “Deixe a garota ser um pouco inocente!”
– Kanye fez a mesma coisa que está fazendo com Bianca com Kim durante todo o casamento. A diferença é que quando Kanye vestiu Kim, ele foi respeitado como pessoa, como artista – disse a fonte ao Daily Mail. – Infelizmente, Kim sabe o que Bianca está passando, mas ela sente que Bianca deveria saber no que estava se metendo.
Kim pediu o divórcio em fevereiro de 2021, pouco antes do que seria o sétimo aniversário de casamento do casal. Em novembro de 2022, o divórcio de Kim e Kanye foi finalizado, com Kanye concordando em pagar US$ 200 mil (aproximadamente R$ 1 milhão) por mês em pensão alimentícia e custódia igualitária.
Kim disse em um episódio anterior de sua série de televisão, sobre a família Kardashian, que “Kanye sempre me vestiu. No início dos anos 2000, ele literalmente me mandava e-mails aleatórios com todos esses looks e qual deveria ser meu estilo”, disse ela. E se Kim discordasse de sua opinião, ele dizia a ela: “Você é minha esposa, suas fotos muito sexy me afetam.” Kanye também chamou a marca SKIMS, fundada pela influenciadora, de “excessivamente sexualizada”.
Kanye se casou com a arquiteta Yeezy, Bianca, em janeiro de 2023. Segundo o tablóide, os pais dela ficaram chocados ao ver a filha com looks atrevidos.
– Sua família e amigos estão mortificados porque tudo está ficando cada vez pior – disse uma fonte ao Daily Mail, depois que ela saiu com uma capa de chuva transparente e nua por baixo. – Bianca claramente não percebe que o que ela vestiu não é apenas nojento e dá um mau exemplo, mas também está potencialmente infringindo a lei. Enquanto isso, Kanye está coberto com cinco camadas de roupas e quando sua esposa parecia com frio, enquanto estava nua e embrulhada em plástico, ele nem sequer ofereceu a ela uma de suas capas.",2024-02-27T14:56:13Z,https://www.mixvale.com.br,Portal Mix Vale

Wie BFFs: Bianca Censori und North West genießen Zweisamkeit,"Sie scheinen einen guten Draht zueinander zu haben! Wenige Monate nachdem sich Kim Kardashian (43) und Kanye West (46) scheiden ließen, heiratete der Rapper Bianca Censori. Mittlerweile scheint diese ein ziemlich gutes Verhältnis zu seinen Kids zu haben – besonders mit North West (10) wirkt sie nämlich ganz schön vertraut. So auch jetzt – Bianca und North sind als Duo gemeinsam in Paris unterwegs!
Das ist auf Fotos zu sehen, die Daily Mail vorliegen. Auf diesen zeigt sich der Promi-Spross mit Kanyes Ehefrau bei einem Spaziergang durch die Stadt der Liebe: Dabei fühlt sich die Zehnjährige allem Anschein nach richtig wohl in der Anwesenheit ihrer Stiefmutter, denn North lacht überglücklich an der Seite von Bianca! Außerdem genießen die beiden einen Snack bei der Fast-Food-Kette Popeyes und machen sogar einen Abstecher zu McDonald's, um es sich so richtig gutgehen zu lassen!
Dass sich die 29-Jährige nicht nur super mit der ältesten Tochter ihres Ehemannes versteht, sondern auch mit seinen weiteren drei Kindern, zeigte Bianca beispielsweise im Dezember vergangenen Jahres: Nach einem Konzert des Musikers trug das Model Chicago West (6) auf dem Arm und begleitete ihre Stiefkinder an den Paparazzi vorbei zu einem Auto. Dieses holte das Gespann von dem Event ab.

Kanye West’s Wife Bianca Censori Seen on Rare Outing With North West,"Kanye West‘s wife, Bianca Censori, 29, was photographed taking a sroll in Paris, France with her stepdaughter North West, 10, on Sunday. The beauty wore a black leather coat , a black mini skirt, and black tights with heels during the outing while North wore a black Vultures Volume 1 sweatshirt in support of her dad, black sweatpants, black boots, and a furry hat. Bianca also had her hair slicked back.
Bianca and North reportedly stopped at two fast food restaurants, including Popeyes and McDonalds, during their outing. They were filmed seemingly ordering electronically inside one of the restaurants and appeared relaxed and content. North’s siblings, Saint West, 8, Chicago West, 6, and Psalm West, 4, didn’t appear to be on the food trip.
Bianca and North’s latest outing comes after the former wowed in a barely-there outfit at a Super Bowl afterparty. It included a light tan bodysuit with cut out sides and the look was first seen online in an Instagram story video shared by Bobby Lytes. She was dancing and smiling, in the clip, and looked like she was having a great time.
Just a few days ago, Bianca also made headlines when she showed up to the Marni runway show during Milan Fashion Week in an eye-catching ensemble. She wore a black leather leotard and pink boots as her straight bob hairstyle looked epic. She was joined by Kanye, who wore a black windbreaker with the hood over his head. He also sported his titanium teeth for the event.
Kanye and Bianca were secretly married in January 2023, just weeks after the rapper’s divorce from Kim Kardashian was finalized. Since they went public with their romance, they haven’t been shy about going to public events together. Kanye also regularly shared photos of his wife and praises her in the captions of the posts. In January, he called Bianca his “muse” in a loving birthday message.
“Happy birthday to the most beautiful super bad iconic muse inspirational talented artist masters degree in architecture 140 IQ loving by my side everyday when half the world turned their backs on me and the most amazing step mom to our children I love you so much thank you for sharing your life with me,” he wrote.",2024-02-26T20:59:18Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
"Kanye West Slams Adidas for Selling 'Fake Yeezys,' 'Suing' Him for $250M","Kanye West has called out Adidas once again after the apparel giant has moved forward with releasing what he calls “fake” Yeezy 350s, which the rapper claims are an unapproved design.
West — who now goes by Ye — got wind of Adidas’ plans to greenlight the “Steel Grey” 350 V2s featuring his designs and put his former business partner on blast on Instagram Monday (Feb. 26) while essentially calling for a boycott.
“Anybody who loves Ye would not buy these fake Yeezys I never made these color ways I’m not getting paid off of them and adidas is suing me,” he wrote in part in a lengthy caption alongside a screenshot of a photo of the footwear. “All the new non-approved 350’s are cooorny and everybody know the 350 been corny.”
Trending on Billboard
Shortly after, Ye posted a video to Instagram explaining his feud with Adidas, and claimed the company was suing him while trying to sell the Yeezy line.
“Not only are they putting out fake colorways that are non-approved, they’re suing me for $250 million and they’re also not paying me for these shoes that they’re putting out that have my name on it,” he claimed, speaking through his titanium dentures.
A spokesman for Adidas did not return a request for comment from Billboard.
Ye’s statements came after Adidas announced Monday that it would sell some of its remaining Yeezy inventory — a tricky problem for the company after splitting with Ye in 2022 following his string of hate speech and antisemitic comments. Since discontinuing the partnership, Adidas says it has donated some proceeds from such sales to groups that “combat discrimination and hate, including racism and antisemitism.”
As of Monday afternoon, there’s no evidence that Adidas has filed any kind of new lawsuit against West or his companies. But last year, Adidas disclosed that it had filed a private arbitration case against West’s Yeezy LLC in December 2022 on the grounds that West’s “racist, antisemitic, and other offensive public statements and conduct” had violated their partnership agreement and had caused “considerable damage to its brand.”
In claiming on Monday that Adidas was “suing” him, West could be referring to that arbitration case. It’s unclear whether $250 million is at stake in that case, or even whether that case is still ongoing, since arbitration proceedings are — by design — litigated behind closed doors.
There had appeared to be a possible path toward reconciliation between Ye and Adidas after the rapper was photographed meeting with the company CEO Bjorn Gulden last week, but that doesn’t look to be the case any longer.
The company started to sell Yeezy products again in May 2023 after cutting ties with the Chicago-bred rap star, and attempted to freeze $75 million worth of Yeezy funds in his bank account. A judge overturned the order to freeze the money a week later.",2024-02-26T20:57:57Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

Kanye West is slamming Adidas for selling “fake” Yeezy sneakers.
“Not only are they putting out fake color ways that are not approved, they’re suing me for $250 million dollars,” the rapper-turned-fashion designer shared in an Instagram video posted Monday.
“They’re also not paying me for these shoes that they’re putting out that have my name on it.”
5 Kanye West put Adidas on blast for allegedly selling “fake” Yeezy color ways.
5 He also claimed the German athletic company was “raping” an artist by doing so and not paying him.

West, who is still showing off his $850,000 titanium dentures, said the sports apparel company is using “contract clauses” and five decades of “business experience” to “rape an artist … in front of y’all in broad daylight.”
In a separate post, the “Street Lights” rapper shared an image of the “fake” sneaker and wrote his devoted fans would never purchase a pair.
5 The “Flashing Lights” rapper also claimed Adidas is suing him for $250 million.
“All these celebrities and the public will stand against a T shirt or the color of my hat but when yall [sic] see me have my children hidden from me or see an actual Fortune 500 company rape one of your heroes in real life don’t nobody say nothing or do nothing,” he wrote in the caption.
West, 46, then asked the “system” what it would do next and wondered if it would “take down” his new album, “Vultures,” or freeze his bank accounts.

“All the new non approved 350’s are cooorny and everybody know the 350 been corny,” he concluded.
Adidas cut ties with the “Jesus Walks” rapper in October 2022 after the designer went on a series of antisemitic tirades and wore a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt to a fashion show.

The deal with the German athletic company accounted for $1.5 billion of West’s net worth, so he lost his billionaire status as he became valued at $400 million, according to Forbes.
In May 2023, Adidas filed — and then immediately dropped — a federal lawsuit against West that aimed to freeze $75 million held by the Yeezy brand.

Adidas to sell more Yeezy shoes after Kanye West divorce,"Adidas is once again putting Yeezy sneakers up for sale through its digital platforms — unloading the remainder of its inventory after the company cut ties with rapper Kanye West over his antisemitic remarks.
This is the third time that the German-based apparel giant has sold Yeezy shoes since the dissolution of its partnership with the rapper known as “Ye,” who took to social media and went on antisemitic rants, resulting in the termination of his business collaborations with brands such as Gap, Balenciaga and JPMorgan Chase.
Adidas has accompanied the sales with donations to groups fighting antisemitism and other forms of hate.
3 Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, was dumped by Adidas in Oct. 2022 over antisemitic remarks. AP
The company announced on its web site that it would offer up the “Steel Grey” Yeezy Boost 350 V2 for $230 a pair on its “Confirmed” app as well as through the Adidas app and adidas.com beginning on Thursday.
Adidas ended its partnership with Ye in October 2022 — leaving the company with more than $1 billion million worth of Yeezy shoes in unsold inventory.
Last May, Adidas paused the sale of Yeezys out of fear of a backlash that it was making money off of its association with Ye.
Last year Adidas earned $813 million in revenue from two Yeezy releases, down from $1.3 billion in 2022.
In late January, Adidas said it expects operating profit to nearly double to about $542.3 million this year after the company’s break-up with Ye and the discontinuation of the Yeezy business.
The company said a better-than-expected fourth quarter was helped by a decision not to write off most of its Yeezy inventory for $325 million. It will instead sell the remaining products at cost.
In December, Ye unveiled the first Yeezy shoe produced since Adidas cut ties.
The announcement coincided with another report from news site TMZ which showed Ye go on a 10-minute rant in Las Vegas during which he just “lost it” — lashing out at Jews yet again.
In the rant, he made insinuations about Jewish influence and compared himself to Jesus Christ and Adolf Hitler.

On Dec. 26, Ye issued an apology in Hebrew to the Jewish community.
“I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any unintended outburst caused by my words or actions,” Ye wrote.
“It was not my intention to offend or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused.”
Ye once suggested slavery was a choice and called the coronavirus vaccine “the mark of the beast.”
In October 2022, he was criticized for wearing a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt at his Paris Fashion Week show and tweeted that he was going to go “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,” an apparent reference to the US defense readiness condition scale, DEFCON.
3 Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden apologized last fall for saying that he doubted Ye “meant what he said.” AP
Later that month, the Balenciaga fashion house cut ties with Ye and he lost the lucrative partnership with Adidas that helped catapult him to billionaire status over his remarks.
He was also dropped by talent agency CAA, and his documentary with MRC Entertainment was scrapped. He was locked out of his accounts on Instagram and what was then known as Twitter, though he has since returned to both platforms.
In September of last year, Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden, who took over as chief executive after the company severed ties with Ye, sparked controversy when he said he doubts that Ye “meant what he said” when he made a series of antisemitic and other offensive remarks last year.
Gulden later apologized for the comment.

Kanye West Performs With North West at Paris 'Vultures' Event: Watch,"Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign wrapped up their European Vultures listening events over the weekend, and fans in Paris were treated to a special moment when North West hit the stage Sunday (Feb. 25).
Kanye — who now goes by Ye — brought his daughter North on stage to perform her Vultures 1 cut “Talking,” which made for a heartfelt moment with the 10-year-old connecting with the crowd singing alongside her proud father. (North, whose mom is Kim Kardashian, also appears in the music video for the track.)
“It’s your bestie, Miss Miss Westie/ Don’t try to test me/ It’s gonna get messy,” she repeats in her catchy verse.
Trending on Billboard
North rocked an all-black outfit to match her dad, with a furry winter hat while holding her hands together and dancing around the smoke-filled stage.
“Talking” debuted at No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Kim Kardashian congratulated her daughter on the accomplishment, as she became one of the youngest acts ever to hit the chart. “My baby,” she wrote to her Instagram Story last week.
Vultures 1 debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 (dated Feb. 24) with 148,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in its opening week (Feb. 9-15, following its Feb. 10 release), according to Luminate.
Vultures arrived independently under Ye’s YZY label and marks his first project since his string of controversies and antisemitic remarks, which resulted in brands such as Universal, Def Jam, Adidas and Gap distancing themselves from the polarizing rap artist.
Despite the backlash, the project is spending a second week atop the Billboard 200 after edging out Yeat’s 2093 in a tight race. It’s Ye’s first time going back-to-back weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with albums since his Watch the Throne collab project with Jay-Z.
After a pair of listening parties in Italy and a final one in Paris, there aren’t any more on the schedule for Ye and Ty Dolla.

"Playboi Carti's New Mask For ""VULTURES 1"" Paris Listening Party Draws Slipknot Comparisons","One of the odd things about the rollout for Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's VULTURES rollout has been the theme of wearing masks. Ye is the one leading the charge in all of this as he was first spotted wearing an all-black cover. It featured a see-through area for his eyes and it must have been fairly breathable because of how often he wore it in public. Then, he went full Jason Voorhees with the famous white hockey mask. Playboi Carti is now doing the same as he was seen wearing a mask resembling the iconic heavy metal band Slipknot.
This extravagant piece was worn for the latest VULTURES 1 listening party in Paris this past weekend. Chris Fehn was the member of the band who popularized the ""Pinocchio nose"" headgear. He is now a former bandmate, but his iconic look still lives on. Plenty of those comparisons were made in the video below as Playboi Carti went with a black leather look compared to Fehn's silver one.

Some fans respected the choice, while others made the obvious but still funny jokes to the fictional character. However, a few people were a little annoyed with Carti trying to be something he is not. ""Bro thinks his genre is rock,"" ""Getting more corny by the day,"" were just a few of those type of remarks. One person even went as far as to say that he wore that mask because ""he lied ab dropping music too much."" That last one is true though, where is Music!?
What are your thoughts on Playboi Carti's new mask for the Paris listening party for VULTURES 1? Is this the better face covering, why or why not?

FRANKFURT – Shoe and sports clothing maker Adidas said Monday it had started a third sale of the Yeezy sneakers it was left with after severing ties with Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.
The company has accompanied the sales with donations to groups fighting antisemitism and other forms of hate.
Recommended Videos Adidas broke up with Ye in October 2022 over his antisemitic and other offensive comments. It has sought a way to responsibly dispose of 1.2 billion euros worth of unsold shoes. The company said it plans to release the remaining Yeezy inventory in the course of this year.
The company said the latest release started Monday on digital platforms. The range available will be products from 2022 including what Adidas said were some of its most popular designs.
Last year Adidas earned 750 million euros ($813 million) in revenue from two Yeezy releases, down from 1.2 billion euros in 2022.
The company spent months looking for a solution. Burning the shoes was ruled out, restitching them to hide the brand rejected as dishonest, and giving them away could have created a resale market. Instead it decided to sell them and donate part of the proceeds.

Kanye West : sa performance ahurissante en présence de sa fille North West,"Précedent Suivant
Kanye West est l’un des rappeurs les plus connus dans le monde. Et ce dernier ne cesse de faire parler de lui. Récemment, il s’est vu vivement critiqué par les internautes en raison d’une performance étonnante et ahurissante. Le tout, en présence de sa fille North West. Cela s’est déroulé ce dimanche 25 février 2024 en France à l’Accor Arena de Paris. Un concert qui a été vivement critiqué par les internautes en raison d’un programme assez spécial. En effet, ce concert était en réalité une “listening experience”, dans laquelle le chanteur Kanye West n’a pas prononcé un seul mot.
Un rappeur fidèle aux scandales ?
Kanye West est un rappeur qui possède une grande renommée. Et ce, à travers le monde entier. Il faut dire que de nombreux morceaux écrits et composés par ce dernier ne cessent d’être écoutés aux quatre coins du globe. Mais ce n’est pas tout, car le rappeur que l’on appelle désormais Ye est aussi un adepte des scandales. Cela a été le cas quand il a exprimé son admiration pour “les nazis”. Des scandales qui font partie de sa gloire et de sa notoriété. Ainsi, cela a encore été le cas récemment. Et ce, durant son concert à l’Accor Arena de Paris. Tout cela a été fait en présence de sa fille North West.

C’est un concert qui se voyait très attendu des fans de Kanye West. Mais tout ne semble pas s’être passé comme prévu. En effet, ce concert était en réalité une “listening experience”. Autrement dit, les plus grands morceaux du chanteur étaient présents. Mais sans que ce dernier prononce un seul mot. Durant ce concert, et d’après les journalistes de BFMTV, Kanye West a simplement mimé les paroles de ces chansons.

Une séquence assez étonnante, à l’heure où les concerts se voient chantés par les membres d’un groupe. Mais si cela se voyait attendu, cette expérience n’a pas fait salle comble. En effet, certains internautes semblent ne pas apprécier cet élément.
Des fans déçus et un album qui cartonne
Ainsi, sachez que la fille de Kanye West, North West, a pris la parole pendant quelques minutes. Et ce, pour son morceau Talking avant que James Blake ne prenne la relève. Sur BFMTV, ce concert divise, et cela l’est aussi auprès des fans de Kanye West. Ainsi, les propos suivants se voient tenus : “Étonnant évènement… ou inquiétant”. Mais, si ce concert n’a pas été un véritable succès, le dernier album de Kanye West l’est en ligne. En effet, l’album Vultures 1 cumule 56 millions d’écoutes. Un chiffre qui peut donner le tournis pour certaines personnes. Et cela confirme le succès encore présent du rappeur dans le monde.",2024-02-26T15:54:13Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty

West and JAY-Z dropped ""N****s In Paris"" with the rest of their collaborative album, Watch the Throne, back in 2011. The song has since reached Diamond certification from the RIAA, marking over 10 million sales. Speaking with XXL at the time, Ye revealed that a trip to Paris inspired him to make the song. ""I am where art meets commercial,"" he said. ""The sweet spot between the hood and Hollywood. Having a conversation with Karl Lagerfeld and Jay-Z within the same hour. When we're in Paris dressing all crazy at fashion shows, we listening to Jay-Z. Jeezy in Paris, that's what it is."" Check out the clip of West performing the song in Paris below.

Adidas og West skilte lag i 2022 etter at sistnevnte kom med en rekke antisemittiske uttalelser. Dermed ble Adidas sittende igjen med en haug produkter fra den West-designede Yeezy-serien.
Hva som skulle skje med restlageret var lenge uklart. I 2023 forsøkte de å selge unna noe av restlageret til inntekt for gode formål. Nå er målet at alt skal være ute i løpet av 2024.
Produktene blir kun tilgjengelige på nett. Målet er å selge varer for 250 millioner euro (2,86 milliarder kroner).",2024-02-26T14:50:55Z,https://e24.no,E24

Kanye West brought his eldest daughter, North West, onstage with him at his latest “Vultures 1” album release party.
The 10-year-old joined the “Gold Digger” rapper at Accor Arena in Paris on Sunday to perform their song, “Talking / Once Again.”
North sang along as the track played over the speakers while bopping around the stage together, according to videos shared on social media.

At one point, North held her hands in a prayer position while repeating the line “Bless me / Bless me.”
Meanwhile, Kanye –– who co-parents North and three other kids with his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian –– did not rap along to the tune and instead pointed to the audience while dancing.
Both North and the Grammy winner, 46, sported all-black outfits at the event.

Ye opted for a look he’s worn before: a jacket, pants, shoes and a “Friday the 13th” face mask.
When Kanye took off the Jason Voorhees face covering, he revealed a white crucifixion figure on his hood underneath, which he first sported at the 2024 Super Bowl earlier this month.
North matched her dad’s look and wore baggy pants, chunky shoes, a graphic T-shirt, a puffer coat with a white stripe down the sleeve and a huge trapper hat.

Mit Gruselmaske: Kanye West performt zusammen mit North!,"Gewohnt bizarr! Erst kürzlich veröffentlichte Kanye West (46) sein neues Album ""Vultures 1"". Dabei kommt besonders ein Track ausgesprochen gut bei seinen Fans an: Der Song ""Talking"", den der Skandalrapper zusammen mit seiner ältesten Tochter North West (10) und Ty Dolla Sign aufnahm, stieg in die Billboard Hot 100 Charts auf Platz 30 ein. Nun gab das Vater-Tochter-Duo den Hit in Paris zum Besten: Kanye erscheint in einem grusligen Outfit auf der Bühne!
Am Sonntagabend gaben North und ihr Vater in Paris ihren neuen Hit zum Besten: Fotos des Auftritts, die Daily Mail veröffentlichte, zeigen Kanye mit einer unheimlichen Eishockeymaske, die er mit einer schwarzen Lederjacke und passender Hose kombinierte. Die 10-Jährige schlüpfte für die Show in eine weite Bomberjacke und eine dunkle Baggy-Hose – als Accessoire wählte sie eine Pelzmütze.
Doch auch North machte in den vergangenen Wochen mit einem skurrilen Look von sich reden: Auf TikTok präsentierte sie stolz ihre neuen Beißerchen – die Tochter von Kim Kardashian (43) hat jetzt funkelnde Grillz und stellt einmal mehr unter Beweise, wie viel Drip sie hat!

Adidas vend d'autres fins de série Yeezy,"HERZOGENAURACH (dpa-AFX) - Le fabricant d'articles de sport Adidas a annoncé la vente d'autres produits de la gamme ""Yeezy"", issus de sa collaboration avec le rappeur controversé Kanye West, qui a pris fin en 2022. Adidas s'était séparé de West en 2022 après plusieurs déclarations jugées antisémites du musicien et designer, ce qui avait entraîné des pertes considérables pour l'entreprise. La vente des stocks restants a longtemps fait l'objet d'un flou. Entre-temps, deux tranches ont été vendues, la prochaine devrait suivre. Adidas a annoncé la fin des ventes pour la fin de l'année.
Les produits seront exclusivement disponibles par voie numérique, a annoncé Adidas lundi à Herzogenaurach. L'entreprise avait déjà annoncé il y a quelques semaines qu'elle lancerait cette année d'autres produits Yeezy à des prix couvrant les coûts. Cela représenterait un chiffre d'affaires d'environ 250 millions d'euros. Cela rendrait inutiles de nouvelles dépréciations importantes.
En 2022, Adidas a réalisé un chiffre d'affaires de 1,2 milliard d'euros avec la plupart de ses produits de marque haut de gamme. Entre-temps, on avait même craint des pertes pour le résultat d'exploitation, au cas où des postes importants auraient dû être amortis. Les ventes de 2023 ont à nouveau généré un chiffre d'affaires de 750 millions d'euros. Selon les informations fournies par l'entreprise, des montants significatifs de ces recettes ont été reversés à des organisations luttant contre la discrimination et la haine, y compris le racisme et l'antisémitisme.
Entre-temps, Adidas estime ne devoir amortir que des postes mineurs de plusieurs dizaines de millions, par exemple pour des marchandises endommagées ou des produits qui ne sont plus disponibles qu'en tailles individuelles. La fin des ventes de Yeezy est prévue pour la fin de l'année /dm/DP/jha.",2024-02-26T11:02:05Z,https://www.zonebourse.com,Zonebourse.com
"Zum Selbstkostenpreis: Adidas wirft wieder ""Yeezy""-Schuhe auf den Markt","Der Adidas-Konzern will Teile des Bestandes an den gemeinsam mit Rapper Kanye West auf den Markt gebrachten Produkten der ""Yeezy""-Reihe auch nach der Trennung von dem umstrittenen Musiker weiter verkaufen.
Als Rapper Kanye West mit antisemitischen Äußerungen Schlagzeilen macht, beschließt der Sportartikel-Hersteller Adidas zunächst, bereits hergestellte ""Yeezy""-Produkte zu vernichten. Chef Gulden ringt sich schließlich dazu durch, die Restbestände doch noch zu verkaufen. Jetzt ist es wieder so weit.
Adidas hat die dritte Verkaufsaktion für ""Yeezy""-Schuhe gestartet. Die von dem Rapper Kanye West (""Ye"") designten Sneaker sollen in den nächsten Wochen nach und nach ausschließlich auf den Online-Kanälen von Adidas angeboten werden, wie der weltweit zweitgrößte Sportartikelhersteller in Herzogenaurach mitteilte.
Analysten haben jüngst für 2024 mit drei ""Drops"" gerechnet, im vergangenen Jahr waren es zwei. Einen dritten Drop hat Adidas laut CEO Björn Gulden im Herbst wegen der Spannungen im Nahen Osten und hoher Unsicherheiten abgesagt.
Das Unternehmen hatte zunächst geplant, die bereits hergestellten ""Yeezy""-Produkte zu vernichten. Adidas hatte sich 2022 von dem US-Rapper getrennt, nachdem er unter anderem mit antisemitischen Äußerungen Schlagzeilen gemacht hatte. Gulden rang sich schließlich dazu durch, die Restbestände doch noch zu verkaufen. Zwei Online-Verkaufsaktionen brachten Adidas 2023 allein 700 Millionen Euro Umsatz und 300 Millionen Euro operativen Gewinn.
Der Rapper hatte gemeinsam mit Adidas teure Lifestyle-Produkte auf den Markt gebracht - ein für beide Seiten höchst lukratives Geschäft. ""Als ich noch beim Wettbewerber war, saß ich da mit großen Augen"", sagte Gulden bei der Bilanz-Pressekonferenz im vergangenen Jahr. ""Yeezy"" bedeutete für Adidas Milliardenumsätze, vor allem in den USA, mit sehr hoher Gewinnspanne. Nach antisemitischen Äußerungen von West stellte Adidas die Zusammenarbeit allerdings ein.
Nun ist noch Ware im Wert von rund 250 Millionen Euro übrig. Adidas will sie zumindest zum Selbstkostenpreis verkaufen. Einen Gewinn hat der Sportartikelhersteller daraus nicht eingeplant, Analysten halten diese Planung aber für zu vorsichtig. Einen Teil der Erlöse aus dem ""Yeezy""-Ausverkauf hat Adidas an Organisationen gespendet, die gegen Rassismus und Antisemitismus kämpfen.",2024-02-26T10:31:24Z,https://www.n-tv.de,n-tv NACHRICHTEN
"Kanye West en concert à Paris : des "" Macron démission "" scandés en chœur dans l’Accor Arena de Bercy","POLITIQUE - Kanye West n’a pas dû reconnaître ses paroles. Le rappeur était à Paris dimanche 25 février pour une « soirée d’écoute », une « listening Experience » comme il l’a qualifiée, à l’Accor Arena de Bercy. Celui qui se fait désormais appeler Ye a voulu faire découvrir au public parisien son nouvel album Vultures 1.
Mais en attendant l’arrivée de la star controversée sur scène, son auditoire avait autre chose en tête. En effet, des « Macron démission » ont été scandés en chœur dans la salle, comme vous pouvez le voir dans les vidéos ci-dessous, publiées sur X (ex-Twitter).

Un slogan qui reste dans le thème des dernières semaines et après le fiasco de l’ouverture du Salon de l’agriculture samedi, ou agriculteurs et CRS se sont affrontés.
Mais ce n’est pas la première fois que ces deux mots résonnent lors d’un concert. C’était déjà le cas en juin dernier lors du Global Citizen, alors que Diane Kruger et son mari Norman Reedus étaient sur scène.
Plus tôt cette année-là, en avril à l’Olympia, la chanteuse norvégienne Girl in Red avait demandé à son auditoire de lui apprendre quelques mots de français. « Macron démission » avait alors été sa leçon du jour.

"Kanye West, toujours à l’ouest","Kanye West à Toronto, au Canada, en 2015. EZRA SHAW / GETTY IMAGES VIA AFP
Vingt ans après son premier album, The College Drop Out, le rappeur très controversé Kanye West publiait le 10 février 2024, Vultures 1 en collaboration avec son collègue américain, Ty Dolla Sign. Dans la foulée, il annonçait la tenue d’une listening party à l’Accor Arena de Bercy à Paris, dimanche 25 février. Une expérience musicale immersive promettait la salle, une belle arnaque en fait pour les spectateurs qui avaient payé entre 90 et 200 euros la place.
Après une heure d’attente, toutes lumières éteintes où certains, pour passer le temps, chantaient le slogan du PSG : « Ici, c’est Paris ! » ou celui des agriculteurs « Macron démission », le public a eu droit à l’écoute intégrale de Vultures 1, dans de bonnes conditions sonores certes, mais sans qu’une seule fois Kanye West et Ty Dolla Sign, masqués, n’aient pris un micro pour rapper ou pour dire un mot. Même pas un « bonjour » ou un « bonsoir », une fois la prestation playback terminée. Ils se contentaient de mimer leurs textes, d’esquisser quelques pas de danse ou d’entrer et sortir d’un halo de lumière centrale sous un écran qui projetait leurs gesticulations. Sur le dernier morceau du disque, King, Kanye West a juste enlevé son masque. Au moins était-ce bien lui qui dansait depuis une heure.
Réflexions antisémites et provocations racistes
Le Kanye West de 2024 n’est plus celui de 2004. Ce n’est plus l’ambitieux, l’enthousiaste musicien et beatmaker de Chicago qui avait signé la plupart des musiques des albums de Jay-Z, Blueprint (2001), et de Scarface, The Fix (2002). Celui-là pétillait, ruait dans les brancards notamment lors de cérémonies des MTV Music Videos pour rabrouer Taylor Swift – qui, déjà, remportait toutes les récompenses – mais s’ingéniait aussi à accélérer les samples de soul, introduisait dans son morceau Jesus Walks une chorale gospel, s’enfermait en studio avec une dizaine d’autres artistes pour que chaque album renouvelle le son hip-hop.
En 2008, il imposait ainsi l’autotune et l’émotion dans les thèmes rap avec 808 Heartbreak. Ce fils d’une professeure de littérature anglaise de Chicago et d’un photographe d’Atlanta ancien membre des Black Panther n’avait alors pas sa langue dans sa poche pour fustiger, par exemple, un président américain trop lent à venir au secours des victimes afro-américaines de l’ouragan Katrina. « George Bush doesn’t care about black people ! » (« George Bush ne se préoccupe pas des Noirs »), déclarait-il en 2005.

Le jeune Kanye West, souvent exalté, toujours prêt à s’emporter, n’a plus rien à voir avec celui qui se fait désormais appeler Ye, de plus en plus tordu, à la fois friand de réflexions antisémites et de provocations racistes à l’égard de sa propre communauté, n’hésitant pas à affirmer, comme en 2018, que l’esclavage est un choix, ou à porter le 3 octobre 2022 le T-shirt des suprémacistes blancs américains, White Lives Matter, en réponse au mouvement qui lutte contre les violences policières, Black Lives Matter.

Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign’s 'Vultures 1' No. 1 for Second Week,"Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and Ty Dolla $ign’s collaborative album Vultures 1 spends a second week atop the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated March 2), earning 75,000 equivalent album units in its second week in the U.S. (down 50%), according to Luminate.
Vultures 1 is Ye’s first album to spend multiple weeks at No. 1 since 2011’s Watch the Throne, with Jay-Z, spent two weeks in charge. In total, of Ye’s 11 No. 1s, three have spent multiple weeks at No. 1: Vultures 1, Watch the Throne and 2005’s Late Registration, all with two weeks atop the list.
Meanwhile, Yeat notches his highest-charting album yet on the Billboard 200 as his latest release, 2093, debuts at No. 2.
Trending on Billboard
The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new March 2, 2024-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Feb. 27. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.
Of Vultures 1’s 75,000 units earned in the tracking week ending Feb. 22, SEA units comprise 72,000 (down 44%, equaling 95.25 million on-demand official streams of the set’s songs), album sales comprise 2,000 (down 89%) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (down 25%).
Rapper Yeat notches his highest-charting title yet on the Billboard 200, as his newest album, 2093, debuts at No. 2. It earned 70,000 equivalent album units in its first week — the artist’s best week by units earned. Of that sum, SEA units comprise 58,000 (equaling 79.15 million on-demand official streams of the set’s songs), album sales comprise 12,000 and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.
2093 was released initially as a 22-song standard album on Feb. 16, boasting features from Future and Lil Wayne. A day later, the album was reissued in a deluxe edition, dubbed 2093 P2, with two bonus tracks, including one featuring Drake. Then, on Feb. 21, the album saw another reissue, termed 2093 P3, with four bonus tracks. The latter version of the album was only available as a digital download via the artist’s official webstore during the tracking week (and the four bonus tracks were only available as part of the full album purchase). All versions of the album are combined for tracking and charting purposes.
Yeat made his debut on the Billboard 200 a little over two years ago with Up 2 Me, when it bowed on the list dated Jan. 22, 2022. It eventually peaked at No. 59. Since then, he’s logged four more entries, and all of them have started in the top 10: 2 Alive (No. 6 in 2022), Lyfe (No. 10 in 2022), AfterLyfe (No. 4 in 2023) and now 2093 (No. 2).
Morgan Wallen’s chart-topping One Thing at a Time rises 4-3 on the new Billboard 200 with 64,000 equivalent album units earned (up 1%), while Noah Kahan’s Stick Season slips 3-4 with 60,000 (down 29%). SZA’s former No. 1 SOS rounds out the top five, as it’s steady at No. 5 with 46,000 (down 9%).
Five former No. 1s finish off the second half of the top 10, as Taylor Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is a non-mover at No. 6 (just over 44,000 equivalent album units; down 12%); Swift’s Lover is stationary at No. 7 (a little more than 43,000; down 11%); Drake’s For All the Dogs climbs 10-8 (43,000; down 4%); Swift’s Midnights dips 8-9 (40,000; down 14%); and 21 Savage’s American Dream rises 11-10 (37,000; down 12%).

North West takes the stage with Kanye after breaking Billboard record,"North featured on her dad Kanye’s track ‘Talking’ on his latest album, ‘Vultures’
North West stole the show once more.
Though it was Kanye who brought his young daughter on stage during the Vultures 1 album release party, the spotlight was on the young artist as she performed the song Talking/ Once Again.
Videos circulating social media showed the father-daughter duo dancing and bopping around to the song as it played over the speakers.
In the track, North famously penned and rapped the words, “It’s your bestie/ Miss, miss Westie/ Don’t trynna test me/ It’s gonna get messy/ Just, just bless me/ Bless me.”
The pair matched in all-black ensembles – North in her puffer coat and huge trapper hat while Kanye opted for his Friday the 13th get-up, complete with a Jason Voorhees mask.
North – whom the legendary rapper shares with ex-wife Kim Kardashian – recently broke records with her collaboration on Kanye’s new album, Vultures 1.

Kanye Wests Frau Bianca fast nackt bei Fashion Week: „Ehe am seidenen Faden“,"„Jeder in ihrem Leben will, dass sie ihn verlässt“
Kanye West und Bianca Censori: Ihre Outfits sind immer für einen Aufreger gut
Wie lange noch bis zum großen Beziehungs-Knall?
Wenn Kanye West (46) und Ehefrau Bianca Censori (29) in der Öffentlichkeit auftauchen, ist ihnen jede Menge Aufmerksamkeit gewiss. Das liegt aber mittlerweile nicht mehr nur an den skurrilen bis fragwürdigen Outfits vor allem von Bianca, die immer neue Varianten von angezogener Nacktheit präsentiert.
Immer häufiger hallt es in Richtung des bizarren Paares: Wie geht es Bianca? Ist sie in dieser Beziehung wirklich glücklich?
Während sie für die Kameras posierten, gab Kanye West seiner Frau einen Kuss
Am Freitag traten Kanye und Bianca auf der Mailänder Fashion Week auf. Während er im schwarzen Look eher unauffällig daherkam, war sie in einen Bodysuit gekleidet, bei dem die untere Hälfte zu fehlen schien.
Oben bedeckte der schwarze Stoff ihr Dekolleté – wenn auch ein Sideboop hervorblitzte. Im Schritt ließ das Outfit aber gerade noch bedeckt, was unbedingt verdeckt bleiben sollte.
Kanye West zeigte sein neues Gebiss komplett aus Titan. Es soll stolze 850 000 US-Dollar (rund 780 000 Euro) gekostet haben
Kanye verhüllt, seine Frau halbnackt – so weit, so gewohnt.
In den vergangenen Monaten soll es allerdings zwischen Bianca und Kanye mächtig gekriselt haben. Eine Quelle sagte der „ Daily Mail“: „Die Ehe von Kanye und Bianca hing an einem seidenen Faden. Jeder in ihrem Leben will, dass sie ihn verlässt, und sie ist sich dessen bewusst.“
Sorge um Bianca CensoriKanye-Frau komplett nackt im Regenmantel 01:27
Hautfarbene Bodys, String-Tangas und andere Halbnackt-Auftritte – das ist Biancas Alltag an der Seite ihres Ehemannes. Dass Kanye West seine Frau zum Aushängeschild seiner extremen Modefantasien macht, ist kein Geheimnis mehr. Kürzlich analysierte die Psychologin Carolyn Mair: „Er objektiviert und entmenschlicht sie.“
Viele Fans finden diese Dynamik bedenklich, sogar toxisch . Sie befürchten, dass Bianca Censori nicht aus eigener Kraft aus der Ehe herausfindet.
Nicht nur auf dem roten Teppich, auch im Alltag zeigt Bianca Censori an der Seite von Kanye viel Haut
Dennoch soll sich die bizarre Beziehung kürzlich schlagartig verbessert haben. Wie die „Daily Mail“ unter Berufung auf Insider berichtet, läuft es dank des großen Erfolgs von Kanye Wests neuem Album „Vultures“ auch zwischen den beiden wieder „drastisch“ besser.
In Biancas Umfeld wiederum soll das für die Befürchtung sorgen, sie könne vor allem aus finanziellen Gründen in der Ehe bleiben. An Kanyes Seite hat aber auch Bianca selbst mittlerweile angeblich ein gutes Vermögen gemacht.
„Niemand bezweifelt, dass sie ihn liebt“, heißt es aus Biancas Umfeld. „Aber die Dynamik ihrer Ehe hat sich durch den Erfolg seines Albums und den massiven neuen Reichtum, den es mit sich gebracht hat, definitiv drastisch verbessert.“
Vielleicht ist diese Ehe nicht nur ein Horror für die Australierin – sondern eine Win-win-Situation für beide … Aber das wissen wohl nur sie selbst.",2024-02-25T17:46:24Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD
Bianca Censori 'behaved well' for husband Kanye West at Milan Fashion Week in racy outfit,"Kanye West 's wife Bianca Censori ""behaved"" for her husband while the couple attended Milan Fashion Week.
The 29-year-old showed off some sultry side-boob and flashed her booty in a thong bodysuit while leaving very little to the imagination in her leather ensemble for the event. She was accompanied by her husband, Ye, 46, whom she married in December 2022.
Since getting hitched, the couple have stepped out on several occasions in very NSFW scenarios, but despite their smitten and racy display, speculation that the marriage is that of a controlling one has been rife, although this is something Ye has denied.

And now, celebrity psychic Inbaal Honigman has carried out an exclusive Tarot reading on the couple following their Milan Fashion Week appearance.

Pulling a card for Kanye, the 6 of Disks card was revealed, which is nicknamed 'success' in the Tarot. ""It is a card that speaks of value and finances,"" Inbaal noted, adding: ""He received compliments, business offers and possibly even cash money to show up when and where he did, and as he walks away with his pockets full, he feels satisfied.""

Meanwhile, Bianca received the 2 of Cups card, which is nicknamed 'love' in the Tarot. ""It is a card that tells of how happy she is that she brought her husband joy. She received positive attention from her husband and other people, which makes her feel as if she did a good job with what she wore and how she behaved,"" Inbaal revealed.
Then, pulling a joint card for the pair, Inbaal unveiled the XVII Star Tarot card, ""which represents hopes and wishes coming true"". Concluding her reading she said: ""It lets us know that their trip was everything they hoped it would be.""",2024-02-25T09:15:28Z,https://www.irishmirror.ie,Irish Mirror
"De Taylor Swift a Kanye West, de café mexido no sentido anti-horário a cama de US$ 8 mil, exigências excêntricas dos astros","Às vezes elas são simples, às vezes mirabolantes. Às vezes atendem ideias sustentáveis, às vezes só servem para massagear o ego. O fato que é que quase todo grande astro faz exigências para seus shows. Conheça alguns pedidos feitos por grandes músicos que passaram ou ainda vão passar pelo Brasil.
Kanye West
Uma das principais exigências do rapper, segundo o Radar Online, é que o camarim seja totalmente branco. Porém, depois que se tornou pai, novos pedidos foram acrescentados a sua lista. North West fica nos bastidores e tem direito a uma cama no valor de 8 mil dólares, uma televisão com todos os seus programas favoritos e um chef à sua disposição para preparar qualquer refeição que ela desejar.
Taylor Swift
Quando esteve em Buenos Aires no ano passado, a loirinha de 33 anos não economizou nas exigências para o seu camarim. Segundo o jornal Clarín, a estrela teria pedido que o local fosse revestido por cristais Swarovski, tivesse flores frescas e uma área exclusiva para descanso antes de subir ao palco.
Além disso, na lista de pedidos estariam 100 garrafas luxuosas de vinho, 100 garrafas de champanhe, dezenas de potes de sorvete da marca Ben & Jerry’s, a sua preferida, 300 garrafas de água natural e com gás, vegetais cozidos no vapor, sanduíches, iogurtes e frustras frescas.
Guns n’ Roses
Com diversas passagens pelo Brasil, a clássica banda de rock faz diferentes exigências a cada vez. Em sua última participação no Rock in Rio, em 2022, pediu nada menos do que 12 camarins, 250 toalhas, dois massagistas e rosas brancas e vermelhas.
Já durante a turnê Not in this Lifetime, em 2021, o grupo de Axl Rose, Slash e Duff McKagan pediu muita ostentação no camarim. As exigências incluíam café, leite normal, desnatado e de soja, chás variados, água com e sem gás, sucos de diversos sabores, refrigerantes diet e normais, como Coca-Cola, Fanta Laranja e Uva, 7-UP, Guaraná, e Gatorades, além de vinhos e cervejas.
Jennifer Lopez
De acordo com o livro “The Little Red Riders Book: The Backstage Requests Of Rock ‘n’ Roll’s Most Famous Artists”, J-Lo já teria exigido flores, toalhas de mesa, cortinas, velas e sofás brancos. A ordem mais excêntrica, porém, é que o seu café sempre fosse mexido no sentido anti-horário.
Kings of Convenience
Em seu show no Circo Voador, o duo pediu que os bares da casa na Lapa fiquem fechados durante a apresentação. Os organizadores do evento negociaram e conseguiram autorização para que o bar principal funcionasse. Entretanto, o público só podia fotografar ou filmar após 30 minutos de show. E a imprensa só foi podia capturar imagens no final, entre as músicas de número 12 e 15.
Lana Del Rey
Lana Del Rey é vegetariana e ama macarrão. Para a sua apresentação no MITA, no ano passado, pediu pizza somente de queijo, macarrão com molho de tomate, e arroz integral com tofu. Sua equipe solicitou um camarim regado de frutas, chás e sucos. Inclusive, pediu um espremedor de sucos e frutas, legumes e especiarias frescas como cenoura, pepino, gengibre, beterraba, limão, lima, maçã, aipo, abacaxi e laranjas. Para sua chegada, um cappuccino e um matcha latte.
Florence and the Machine
Também escalada no MITA ano passado, a banda segue o padrão mais sustentável possível: garrafas de água de vidro, pratos e tigelas de porcelana, canecas e copos de vidros, entre outros.
Florence pede ainda uma cafeteira francesa com café moído da marca Lavazza, cesta de frutas frescas, como bananas, manga, maçã, abacate; além de bandeja vegetariana com cenouras, pepinos e aipo. Entre as refeições, os pedidos vão desde sopa vegetariana (tomate, abóbora, entre outros), salada de atum, comida tailandesa, ramen e sushi.",2024-02-25T03:06:37Z,https://www.mixvale.com.br,Portal Mix Vale

Maya picked out a relaxed but stylish ensemble that included an oversized striped shirt paired with aquamarine flared trousers.
She teamed them with grey, blue print stiletto heels, and glamorous make-up, with her hair cascading over her shoulders in Hollywood waves.
Maya paid a nod to designer Marni at their catwalk show by being snapped with a large, eye-catching handbag from their collection.
Meanwhile, Jesus Walks rapper Kanye and architect Bianca, 29, complimented each other dressed in black.
However, Australian beauty Bianca stole the spotlight in a PVC bodysuit that flashed the sides of her body.
She wore pink boots instead of trousers, and sported a new dark black bob hairstyle as she cosied up to her 46-year-old husband at the event.
The latex black triangle was sewn precariously at the crotch and shoulders to remain in place.
Maya's recent appearance follows her hosting the All Stars version of Love Island.
It concluded on Monday before she jetted off to Milan Fashion Week from Cape Town International Airport with her boyfriend, Stormzy.

Before the flight they were spotted puffing on a roll-up before heading back to Europe.
Maya, who has previously been seen puffing a large rolled up cigarette on holiday in Barbados back in 2018, is not known to be a big smoker.
Stormzy has previously spoken about smoking cannabis and said that early on in his music career he would use the Class B drug.
The couple reunited last year after four years apart, having previously dated for two years back in 2016.
Since then, both have gone to to establish themselves in their own spaces within the entertainment industry - notably Maya becoming a model and Love Island presenter.
Stormzy has become the standout grime star of the UK music industry, and also uses his platform to launch business and initiatives including Merky Books and a scholarship at Cambridge University for Black students.

Bianca Censori: Πρώτη δημόσια εμφάνιση με τον Kanye West ντυμένη!,"Φυσικά, η ντυμένη εκδοχή της Censori δεν κράτησε για πολύ.... Αποκαλυπτική εμφάνιση χθες σε πάρτι στο Μιλάνο
Μία εντελώς διαφορετική για τα δεδομένα τους εμφάνιση – έκαναν πριν λίγες ημέρες ο Kanye West και η σύζυγός του, Bianca Censori.
Η κατά κανόνα σχεδόν γυμνή Censori ντύθηκε και ο διάσημος σύζυγός της κυκλοφόρησε δημοσίως ντυμένος απλά, χωρίς τα συνηθισμένα full face.
Για την ακρίβεια, το ζευγάρι έκανε αυτή την «χαμηλών τόνων» εμφάνιση, στη Φλωρεντία αυτή την εβδομάδα, μετά τον σάλο του Super Bowl όπου ο West - γνωστός ως ΥΕ – ουσιαστικά έβρισε όλους όσους τον κατηγορούν για τον τρόπο που «εκμεταλλεύεται» την γυναίκα του και για την εμμονή του να την φωτογραφίζει γυμνή.
Συγκεκριμένα, η Page Six σχολίασε την τελευταία εμφάνιση της Censori αναφέροντας πως ήταν «εντελώς ντυμένη και καλυμμένη με ένα μαύρο φούτερ με κουκούλα πάνω από το κεφάλι της και μια oversized μαύρη δερμάτινη καμπαρντίνα».
Ο West από την πλευρά του έκανε και αυτός στροφή σε ένα αρκετά συντηρητικό για τον ίδιο look, φορώντας ένα σκούρο αντιανεμικό με κουκούλα και ασορτί παντελόνι.
Φυσικά, η ντυμένη εκδοχή της Censori δεν κράτησε για πολύ.
Χθες το βράδυ, σε πάρτι στο Μιλάνο όπου και βρίσκεται το ζευγάρι για την παρουσίαση του νέου άλμπουμ του διάσημου ράπερ, η νεαρή σύζυγος του West, έκανε άλλη μία αποκαλυπτική εμφάνιση και τα φλας πήραν φωτιά.
Σε διαφορετικό event για την εβδομάδα Μόδας στο Μιλάνο, η Bianca φωτογραφήθηκε και πάλι ντυμένη προκλητικά, αλλά σαφως πιο… καλυμμένη, τουλάχιστον από την μέση και πάνω.

"Bianca Censori Debuts Short Haircut and Bangs, Flaunting Risqué Bodysuit With Kanye West in Milan","Bianca Censori and her husband, Kanye West, made quite the fashion statement as they graced the red carpet at a recent event in Italy. The couple, famous for their bold fashion choices, turned heads with their edgy ensembles and eye-catching looks.
Both West and Censori opted for all-black outfits, flaunting their distinctive style. West donned a hoodie with crinkled material, adding his signature touch to the ensemble.
Meanwhile, Censori rocked a structured bodysuit with a wide neck, revealing her daring fashion sense. However, it was Censori’s new hairstyle that stole the show. Flaunting a jet-black bob with thin bangs styled across her forehead, she exuded confidence and sophistication. The sleek and modern look complemented her outfit perfectly, adding an extra element of glamour to her appearance.

As they posed for the cameras, West and Censori appeared stoic yet effortlessly chic. Despite their composed demeanor, they couldn’t help but share a few sly smiles, portraying their playful chemistry. As per Mirror, the rumors about their relationship were fueled further by their recent outing in Milan. Paparazzi caught the couple snuggling up to each other as they enjoyed a meal at the Four Seasons hotel.
This cozy moment captured by the paparazzi suggested that their bond was stronger than ever. Censori’s outfit choice for the occasion was as provocative as ever, with her breasts and butt visible through the sheer fabric. The daring outfit perfectly captured her fearless and unique approach to fashion.
However, Censori’s risqué fashion choices have reportedly caused tension with West’s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian. As per the reports of The Sun, Kardashian has expressed concerns about Censori’s attire, specifically when she’s around their four children. The source revealed, ""Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids. She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.""
Despite the rumors surrounding their relationship, West and Censori have remained united. The couple has been spotted together at several events, showcasing their love and affection for each other.

The success of West’s new album, Vultures I, seems to have brought them closer together. The album’s chart-topping success and commercial acclaim have reportedly rekindled their relationship, with Censori standing by West’s side through thick and thin. An insider revealed, ""Kanye and Bianca's marriage was hanging on by a thread.
Everyone in her life wants her to leave him and she is aware of this. She knows [what] everyone thinks of her husband – and his recent outbursts were causing her to question everything. The dynamics of their marriage improved drastically due to the success of his album and the massive new influx of wealth it has brought.”
West and Censori prove that they are a force to be reckoned with in the world of fashion and entertainment. With their bold fashion choices and unapologetic attitude, they are undoubtedly a dynamic duo to watch out for.",2024-02-24T09:12:01Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Fast nackt: Bianca Censori zeigt ihren neuen Look in Mailand,"Ein neuer Tag, ein neuer Look! Die Yeezy-Architektin Bianca Censori ist seit Dezember 2022 mit dem Rapper Kanye West (46) verheiratet. Seitdem sind die beiden sehr oft in den Schlagzeilen – vor allem wegen Biancas Outfits. Anscheinend soll Kanye ihr vorschreiben, was sie anziehen soll, und präsentiert sie regelmäßig auf Social Media. Doch die freizügigen Outfits lösen bei den Fans nur fragwürdige Reaktionen aus. Nun zeigt Bianca sich bei einem Konzert wieder sehr gewagt.
Nach einem Video, das TMZ vorliegt, präsentierte sich die Ehefrau von Kanye wieder nahezu entblößt. Bianca unterstützte Kanye auf der Veranstaltung seines neuen Albums ""Vultures"". Diese fand am Donnerstagabend in Mailand statt. Ihr Outfit bestand aus einer schwarzen, transparenten Strumpfhose mit einem schwarzen Tank-Top, das ihre Nippel entblößte.⁣ Ihre Haare stylte sie zu einem strengen Bob mit einem Pony.
Im Gegensatz zu ihrer üblichen Kleidung überraschten die beiden vergangene Woche mit einem eher simpleren Look. Am Valentinstag spazierten sie im schwarzen Partnerlook in Winterjacken und langer Hose durch Florenz. Ob sich die beiden die Kritik der Fans zu Herzen genommen haben?

Kanye West all’Unipol Arena: attesi 8mila spettatori per lo show del rapper. Il Gran Reno blindato,"Ye è qui. Sentirlo cantare o vederlo in faccia sarà invece tutto un altro discorso. Come del resto suggerito dal titolo dell’evento, che parla di una “listening experience”, esperienza d’ascolto, anche stasera all’Unipol Arena come accaduto giovedì al Forum di Milano quella di Kanye West sarà una performance artistica e non un concerto, e del resto sono anni che il rapper non si esibisce dal vivo.
Prendere o lasciare, la star americana è nota e amata dai suoi fan anche per la sua imprevedibilità e le scelte eccentriche dentro e fuori dal palco, per cui anche l’evento a Bologna dovrebbe essere – per le ragioni di cui sopra il condizionale è d’obbligo, anche se tutto suggerisce che lo schema cui hanno assistito gli spettatori della prima ad Assago si ripeterà – un’occasione per ascoltare il nuovo disco “Vultures Vol. 1” mentre Kanye e i suoi colleghi lo rappresentano, ma senza cantarlo, a pochi passi dal pubblico.
Con Ye, come ha cambiato legalmente il proprio nome qualche anno fa, ci sarà il collega Ty Dolla Sign e probabilmente qualche altro ospite a sorpresa, come accaduto due giorni fa a Milano. E come lì, l’allestimento dell’Unipol Arena dovrebbe essere minimal, con tutti gli spettatori seduti in tribuna e i rapper a occupare con la loro presenza scenica il parterre, senza un vero e proprio palco.
Tutto si baserà sull’esperienza acustica, coi brani del disco uscito quindici giorni fa riproposti ad altissima fedeltà sonora, e del sentirsi in presenza, nel qui e nell’ora, di un appuntamento eccentrico ma a suo modo storico nel panorama del rap contemporaneo.
Per l’evento annunciato a sorpresa una settimana fa sono attesi circa ottomila spettatori all’Unipol Arena, per quanto ci siano biglietti ancora disponibili con prezzi che vanno da 138 a 184 euro l’uno, e un folto dispiegamento di forze dell’ordine. Che fanno sapere di essere in massima allerta, in particolare dopo gli episodi di microcriminalità e i disordini avvenuti negli scorsi mesi nella zona del centro commerciale di Casalecchio, che sarà a sua volta presidiato con controlli rafforzati su tutta l’area.
Kanye West intanto sta passando giorni di full immersion italiana e milanese, in coincidenza peraltro con la fashion week, lui che è diventato anche imprenditore di moda con la fortunata linea di scarpe Yeezy oltre ad aver collaborato con Adidas, Nike, Louis Vuitton.
Prima ha assistito alla partita di Champions tra Inter e Atletico, con un giaccone nero con cappuccio e passamontagna a coprirgli il volto, stesso outfit poi proposto allo show al Forum.
Poi s’è fatto vedere assieme agli ultras della Curva Nord nerazzurra i cui cori ha campionato per uno dei brani di “Vultures”: i tifosi avrebbero dovuto anche partecipare allo spettacolo meneghino, ma poi non se n’è fatto nulla. Dopo la performance di stasera a Bologna poi Kanye West partirà per Parigi dove domani alla Accor Arena ha in programma l’ultimo, almeno per ora, last minute show in Europa. Uno strano tour che ha fatto, sta facendo e farà discutere. E così il primo risultato Ye l’ha già portato a casa.",2024-02-24T07:25:50Z,https://bologna.repubblica.it,La Repubblica
When Kanye West Revealed His Advice to Daughter North West About 'Never Selling The Company',"Kanye West and his ex-wife Kim Kardashian’s daughter, North West have gained even more popularity since the release of her dad’s album, Vultures. West and his daughter are known to have a tight bond with each other. Although her parents are navigating co-parenting, it hasn’t in any manner stopped West from always making time for his little girl no matter what. As per a 2022 article by E! Online, West had but one important piece of advice for the rising star.

In a conversation with Fox News’Tucker Carlson, West recounted his fond exchange with his oldest daughter. Do note this was shortly before the divorce from his ex-wife Kim Kardashian that took place shortly after the interview. Almost all of West’s kids are passionate about Basketball among other sports.

West’s oldest daughter is one of the four who is known to be pretty amazing at it. The Flashing Lights remembered the day he helped her work on her skills with the sport. He said, “North likes basketball. I’m going to come and practice with her every day. I’m also going to pick the other coaches that work with her.”
The rapper’s comments insinuate gestures of a loving father who wants what’s best for her. On that note, he continued to recall an observation: “When North snatches the ball out of a girl twice her size…” He paused briefly and revealed what he told her, “I tell her, ‘Don’t let anyone take anything from you ever.""
He adds, ""Don’t let anyone take anything from our family.” West in great seriousness added, “Don’t let anyone take our company. Always protect your brothers and sisters.” The gravity of West’s profound words echoed something he pointed out in a previous interview with ABC News earlier that year in September.
West said, “I’m saying stuff to North like, ‘Never let anyone take anything from you. Protect your little brothers and sisters. Protect the family. Never let anyone take our company.” He went on to explain his reasoning behind his advice. He elaborates saying, “I’m literally saying this to her because I realize she’s one of the people in the family that will make sure that no one ever takes our company, no one ever takes what me and Kim have built with both of our brands and the brands that we’re building.”

Well, one thing’s for certain: West and Kardashian’s oldest daughter has the same sophisticated and hard-working drive as her parents. The soon-to-be-teen has already made an appearance on her mother’s reality television series and is a favorite.

She attended the show with her husband Kanye West, but all of the attention was on her.
She was wearing a black bodysuit that featured a unique and abstract shape.
The bodysuit had high thigh cuts that showed her legs and hips all the way up to her waist.
Some of her crotch was also revealed as well as her side boob as the top of her outfit didn't form to her top.
The top of the bodysuit appeared to be pinned together on the top of both shoulders.
Bianca also showed off her new hairstyle which was a black bob with very thin bangs.
She wore blue smoky makeup and nude lipstick that allowed her makeup to match her outfit.
POOR THING
Fans on social media have a lot of concerns regarding Bianca and her emotional state.
One said: ""Since she’s been introduced she’s been walking around naked around the world.
""Let us know when she actually says a d**n word. That would be a shocker.""

Another wrote: ""I don’t know her history so I can’t tell if she likes the attention it’s bringing her or if he is mentally abusive to her.
""Either way, I feel sorry for her. He is not a good person, I think most would agree on that.""
""The lights are on. But no one is home. She has such a blank stare,"" commented a third.
A fourth added: ""I feel so bad for this woman!""
HANGING ON
Kanye and Bianca's marriage has reportedly been saved by the success of his long-awaited new album.
A new report says Bianca, was preparing to bolt from Ye, after his continued antisemitic rants - most recently at a listening party in Las Vegas for his new album, Vultures.
""Kanye and Bianca's marriage was hanging on by a thread,"" an insider told DailyMail.com.
""Everyone in her life wants her to leave him and she is aware of this.""
The source said it all came to a head earlier this month in Vegas.
""She knows [what] everyone thinks of her husband – and his recent outbursts were causing her to question everything.""
But the insider says success heals all wounds, adding that after Vultures hit number one on music charts, Bianca is suddenly, ""Back to being a loving, adoring and supportive wife.""
Yeezy's added score after airing a commercial during the Super Bowl only helped solidify her love.
""'The dynamics of their marriage definitely improved drastically due to the success of his album and the massive new influx of wealth it has brought,"" the source concluded.

French Montana Releases 'Mac & Cheese 5' Mixtape: Stream It Now,"It’s been an arduous-yet-fruitful journey for French Montana navigating the turbulent music industry since 2009’s Mac Wit Da Cheese.
Fifteen years later, The Bronx-bred rapper has returned to serve up the fifth installment of his famed mixtape series as Mac & Cheese 5 hit streaming services on Friday (Feb. 23).

French brought along an all-star cast of talented artists to join him in executing his vision for the 21-track project.
Guests making appearances include Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Lil Durk, Lil Baby, Meek Mill, JID, Westside Gunn, 41, Jeremih, Bryson Tiller and more.
The Moroccan rapper detailed his inspiration behind Mac & Cheese 5 and how he wants to see more artists attack mixtape series rather than just recording albums.
Trending on Billboard
“I feel like I needed to get everything out the way then go back to the mixtape vibes. I always try to go where the puck is going, not where the puck is at. I feel like the game needs mixtapes,” he told The Breakfast Club on Friday.
“That feeling isn’t there anymore. Albums is dope everybody’s getting used to it, but I want to hear [Lil] Wayne mixtapes, Rick Ross Rich Forever mixtapes, Wiz Khalifa [Kush & Orange Juice] mixtapes. I just want to get back to that vibe and I want to lead the way with the mixtapes.”
Prior to unleashing Mac & Cheese 5, the “Unforgettable” rapper got back to his roots for a Coke Boys meets Gangsta Grillz project with DJ Drama. Coke Boys 6 arrived in Jan. 2023 and featured assists from A$AP Rocky, Rob49 and Benny The Butcher among others.

Can His Agent Help?,"Booking agent Cara Lewis is once again representing Kanye West, working to revive his prosperous touring career that she architected in the 2000s and 2010s before he meticulously destroyed it after firing her in 2016.
Lewis has already had some early success, landing West and Ty Dolla $ign a headlining slot at Rolling Loud in Los Angeles March 14 to promote their new chart-topping album, Vultures 1. But in the long term, Lewis faces much more difficult odds undoing the damage West wrought on his own career, burning bridges with promoters, racking up multi-million-dollar lawsuits with vendors and production companies and making vitriolic and antisemitic statements that have gotten him banned by all the major talent agencies.
That leaves very little runaway for Lewis — “a self-described Jewish girl from the Bronx,” according to a 2023 profile in Pollstar — to relaunch West’s career. The saga is the talk of the town in both Los Angeles and New York, with more than six high-level booking agents telling Billboard that Lewis’ ability to produce business opportunities for West will be determined by West himself.
Trending on Billboard
“He’s still on his bulls—, which means he is still in self-destruct mode and can’t work,” said one prominent booking agent who spoke on the condition of anonymity but said their agency was approached about representing West and passed. “I don’t take anything he says at face value. He needs to go away for at least a year and get sober.”
Lewis did not respond to a request for comment.
“There’s not really any upside for Cara,” says another booking agent who was also pitched on representing West. “She’s going to spend most of her time being told ‘no’ by promoters who have been burned by Kanye in the past. And any gigs she does land for him are going to be nightmares to get through.”
West has recently posted on social media about his booking challenges. On Feb 6, he took to Instagram to complain about the lack of interest from major arenas in hosting a listening party for his new album.
“We just sold out the United Center in seven minutes,” he shared in a video. “It’s the only arena that I had access to in the past year. And when I call, people say there’s no [availabilities] for me, and you know why that is.”
West made the video shortly after the O2 Arena in London rejected a similar request. He followed up that video by asking followers to contact Lewis for booking opportunities, showing a text message Lewis had sent to West expressing confidence about his future prospects. The post showing the text message was later deleted by West.
Kanye first began working with Lewis in 2006 when she was at the William Morris Agency, which became William Morris Endeavor (WME) in 2009. In 2012, Lewis quit WME to join CAA, bringing with her high-profile clients like Eminem, Ne-Yo, T.I. and West. Together, West and Lewis developed a touring strategy that generated $160 million in ticket sales, including his Watch the Throne Tour with Jay-Z, which generated $75 million in sales and was the highest-grossing tour ever when it wrapped, according to Billboard Boxscore.
Had West not stopped touring in 2016, he could have easily generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from concerts and festivals in the years since. Even without any regular income from touring for the last seven years, West still ranks as the fifth highest-grossing hip-hop act in Billboard Boxscore history.
But instead of building upon their success, West fired Lewis and CAA and signed with UTA in March 2016. The Wrap reported at the time that West left CAA to expand his acting portfolio following the success of his cameo in Zoolander 2.
West returned to CAA a year later, but by then Lewis was already gone, working to launch her own boutique agency after she and CAA parted ways in November 2016.
While Lewis was setting up her new business, things really started going downhill for West. In October 2016, moments before taking the stage at the Meadows Music & Arts Festival in New York, West learned that his wife, Kim Kardashian, had been robbed at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room. He ended up canceling the set so that he could fly to France to be with her.
The Paris incident also led him to cancel two dates on his Saint Pablo Tour, ultimately returning to the road five days later on Oct. 7 to perform a show at the United Center. Fans noticed that West had seemed withdrawn and erratic on the tour, which eventually ended 20 dates early in Sacramento on Nov. 19, 2016, when West performed three songs before launching into a tirade about Facebook, Jay-Z, Hillary Clinton and Beyoncé before walking offstage. West was hospitalized two days later following a welfare check conducted by the LAPD.
An investigation by insurance company Lloyds of London, which West had hired to insure the tour, alleged that he was abusing alcohol and marijuana on the tour. The two parties eventually settled the dispute, court documents show.
In 2022, West was sued by Phantom Labs, a company he hired to help produce the Free Larry Hoover benefit concert with rapper Drake in December 2021. Six months after the concert, Phantom Labs sued West, saying it was owed “$7 million by Kanye in outstanding fees for work on various projects over the past year,” including the Free Larry Hoover concert and his 2022 appearance at Coachella, which Kanye canceled days before he was to take the stage.
“While West’s history is well known, I wouldn’t say the curtain has closed on his career quite yet,” said one promoter who has followed West’s career and didn’t want to be named in this article. “I’m going to reserve judgment until after his Rolling Loud appearance. If he pulls off a big show and people view it as successful, that will buy him a lot of goodwill and time. Perhaps some of [his] former partners can be persuaded to work out an agreement with him. Or maybe he will blow the whole thing up again. Either way it will be entertaining to watch, and we can all say we were there to see it happen.”",2024-02-23T22:31:38Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Kanye West Claims He's From Mars And Gives NSFW Answer About His Favorite Meal,"Kanye West is back in Europe this week. He traveled around the continent last summer with his wife Bianca Censori where he got in trouble numerous times. The pair are have returned to Italy this week primarily for two listening parties for West and Ty Dolla $ign's new album VULTURES 1. But while there, the pair hit up a fashion show in Milan. Much of the attention was first directed at Censori's characteristically scant outfit. But now, a video of West being interviewed during the event is making the rounds online.
As he does in almost every interview nowadays, West says some bizarre things. It starts out when he introduces himself, which includes an off-handed claim that he's from Mars. He then gives a tour of his entire fit which is head to toe with notable pieces. The final 30 seconds of the interview are a series of seemingly unrelated questions, all of which West seems happy to answer. That goes extra for when he's asked about his favorite meal, which he answers with no hesitation. Check out the NSFW response he gives to the question below.

Kanye West hosted some similar listening parties in Chicago earlier this month. The shows were controversial right away for some of the lyrics in his songs as well as samples of Donna Summer and Black Sabbath songs he didn't get properly cleared. Ozzy Osbourne himself ended up calling West out on Twitter. He labelled the rapper an antisemite and said he wants no association with him.
Despite all the controversy surrounding VULTURES 1, fans still tuned into the album. It sold enough copies to debut at the very top spot on the Billboard 200 in its first week.

Kanye West’s Wife Bianca Rocks Black Leotard at Milan Fashion Week,"Kanye West, 46, and his wife, Bianca Censori, 29, turned heads during their appearance at Milan Fashion Week on February 23! The lovebirds spiced up date night by attending the Marni runway show and in typical Ye fashion they made sure that their outfits stood out from the crowd. Bianca, for her part, sizzled in a leather leotard which featured a high-cut design in the front as well as a thong in the back.
The architect and Kanye’s latest muse made sure to accessorize the ensemble with bubblegum pink latex boots and a few silver rings. Bianca stunned with a chic brunette bob and glammed up the look with icy-blue eyeshadow and a nude lip. Meanwhile, the “Heartless” rapper opted for a black hooded windbreaker and matching leather pants. Kim Kardashian‘s ex-husband also sported his new titanium teeth during the outing.
Not only did the father-of-four attend the fashion show with Bianca, but they couple also put their love on full display. Ye was photographed whispering in his wife’s ear several times and appeared in good spirits. Both the 29-year-old and her hubby sat in the front row and feasted their eyes on the latest designs. While at the show, Kanye was asked to give others a “styling tip,” to which he was quick to respond. “Me. That’s the only tip you need to know – me!” he quipped in the re-shared video.
Soon after photos and videos of the duo at the fashion show landed on social media, many Kanye fans took to the comments to react. “Bianca makes him happy, I’m glad,” one admirer tweeted, while another added, “Bianca looks like a Bond girl and ye looks like the new face of Nike.” Meanwhile, a third fan compared Bianca to actress Kerry Washington. “She got them Kerry Washington eyes,” they penned. The Grammy winner and Bianca have been linked since December 2022 and were quietly married at the top of 2023.
Last week, Kanye’s wife also turned heads in a tan bodysuit during an appearance at a Super Bowl after party. The brunette bombshell nearly bared it all with the barely-there outfit and was spotted dancing in a club with friends (watch here). Bianca is no stranger to daring looks, as she is often featured on her man’s Instagram with nearly nothing on. At the end of January, the Yeezy designer even shared photos of his love in nothing but a swimsuit and a face mask. Ye has since deleted the photos and currently has his Instagram dedicated to promoting his latest album, Vultures 1.",2024-02-23T20:54:00Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife

Kanye West And Tucker Carlson Interview Leaker Gets Indicted On 14 Charges,"Back in 2022, Kanye West spent months making appearances on numerous talk shows where he was allowed to spout antisemitic conspiracies. One of those interviews was with Tucker Carlson, who was occupying the main slot on Fox News at the time. A segment did air where the pair had a conversation about West's beliefs and some of the pushback he's received for expressing them. But not everything they recorded during their time together made it onto the on air version of the interview.
Shorty after the interview aired the parts that didn't make it to broadcast leaked online. The clips were a particularly bad look for both West and Carlson and it made sense why they were cut in the first place. But recently, a journalist who was involved with the leaking of the videos in the first place was indicted on numerous charges reportedly stemming from the leak. Tim Burke is a journalist in Tampa whose house was recently raided by the FBI. Following the raid he was hit with numerous counts of accessing a computer without permission and intercepting electronic communications. The Tampa Bay Times confirmed that the arrest stemmed from the West interview leak. Check out one of the most viral clips from the original interview below.

Bianca Censori Joins Kanye West At Milan Fashion Week With Risque Outfit,"Kanye West and Bianca Censori recently hit up Milan Fashion Week, and they pulled up in almost their usual fare. Moreover, the Chicago artist wore grills and a large black anorak-adjacent jacket with leather pants and black sneakers. However, the Yeezy architect switched up her usual hairstyle, swapping out her golden short look for a dark-brown bob cut. As far as her fashion, she wore what looks like a black bag on her chest to match with Ye, but that's really a one-piece that she matched with pointy pink boots. As usual, these were some pretty eclectic fits to rock that raised a lot of eyebrows.
Furthermore, this isn't the only notable crossover with the Vultures creative that Censori had to step in for this week. Adin Ross recently issued a public apology to Kanye West after Bianca Censori apparently sent him an email to clarify some claims he made. The streamer suggested that Spotify, Apple Music, and other DSPs didn't want to pay him for his new collab album with Ty Dolla $ign. Basically, he was trying to argue that Ye should hop on his stream because he needs the money, and apparently the rapper's wife stepped in to set the record straight.

Still, back to the actual Milan Fashion Week look, this wasn't entirely surprising if you checked out any footage related to the Vultures listening event in Milan before this runway show. There, Bianca Censori debuted this new cut and clips emerged of her filming Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's spectacle. They are still raking in a lot of money from streams off the album, and folks are still debating its quality and whether or not we'll get the sequels. Given how chaotic things have been up until this point, it's anyone's guess.
Meanwhile, as the controversies around the ""CARNIVAL"" MC's antisemitism continue to mount, it's tough to say whether this will be a more pressing issue or a slowly fading one. Hopefully the latter option happens if he truly shows remorse, change, accountability, and responsibility for what he's said and done. If not, then hopefully the former is what manifests one day.

Kanye West Reportedly Is Losing This Much Money By Selling Yeezys For $20,"Kanye West is easily one of the biggest names when it comes to the sneaker world. Overall, he built his empire with Adidas, at least for the most part. Although he started off with Nike, it was Adidas that led to his largest run of prosperity. Now, however, he is on his own again and it has taken him a while to get the Yeezy brand back on its feet. With his Vultures rollout still ongoing, Ye has gotten back into the sneaker world. The Yeezy Pod is his new creation, and it resembles a sock more than anything else.
After selling the shoe for a staggering $200 USD, Ye decided to change course and sell the shoe for $20. That is a 90 percent reduction from the original price. Furthermore, this is a new strategy for Ye as it pertains to his entire streetwear empire. He has been selling all of his items for the low price of $20. However, as you can imagine, this has affected his margins quite substantially. According to the Twitter aggregator Kurrco, Ye is currently taking a $17 loss on every Yeezy Pod sale.

Kanye West Is Doing It For The People
The cost to make these, as well as the shipping and handling, comes to about $37. When you do some simple math, it becomes clear as to what the math is. For now, this seems like the cost of doing business from a marketing perspective. With all of his shoes going for $20, he is getting an increase in sales. People are now curious about his Yeezy brand again, and once he starts selling things at a normal price, he will have a consumer base. Only time will tell whether or not he changes his prices anytime soon. Once he bleeds enough money, he will likely have no choice.
Let us know what you think of the Yeezy Pods, in the comments section down below. Additionally, stay tuned to HNHH for all of the latest news and updates from around the music world. We will continue to keep you informed on all of your favorite artists and their upcoming projects.

Kanye West Named As Antisemitic Influence In Columbia University Discrimination Lawsuit,"Debates about inclusivity, specifically fighting antisemitism have been hitting some of America's highest-rated educational institutions. One of which is Columbia University, which is facing a new lawsuit alleging it failed to effectively fight antisemitism on campus. Students Against Antisemitism, StandWithUs Center For Legal Justice, and numerous Jewish and Israeli students are teaming up to bring the lawsuit against the university. The lawsuit collects a series of personal anecdotes meant to demonstrate that the school has perpetually failed to fight the rising tide of antisemitism on campus.
Among those anecdotes are references to Kanye West. The rapper famously spent the past two years making public appearances where he spread antisemitic conspiracy theories and even openly embraced racist ideologies. The lawsuit cites a specific moment where students on campus were discussing some of the theories he was spreading. They even allegedly shared an image of racist symbology originally shared by West. Check out some more details from the new lawsuit below.

The controversy surrounding him has continued nearly nonstop ever since. While spending time in Europe he found himself in trouble numerous times alongside girlfriend Bianca Censori. And late last year he returned to Los Angeles and announced his new album VULTURES.
VULTURES eventually came out earlier this month and was slammed by critics. Many cited the unfinished sound of the record and numerous controversial lyrics throughout as reasons to avoid the project. Despite that, enough fans ended up tuning in for the album to hit number one on the Billboard 200. West is currently back in Europe for a pair of listening parties for the newly released album.

Adin Ross Apologizes To Kanye West After Bianca Censori Intervenes,"Adin Ross has apologized for his previous comments about Kanye West struggling to get brand deals. According to Ross, he had been driven to make the rare apology after Kanye's wife, Bianca Censori, reached out to Ross to set the record straight. Ross confirmed he had received an email directly from Censori asking him to retract his statements.
Ross had tried to continue his trend of paying rappers to appear on his streams by saying he had the backing of Kick and Stake to pay Kanye for an appearance. This was taken as Ross saying that either Kanye is broke or that Kanye needs the charity. Ross backpedaled during his apology, stating that what he meant is that streaming services were not paying Kanye because ""they're not throwing money at anyone."" Do you believe Ross' apology? Do you consider it an apology at all? Let us know in the comments.

However, Ross doesn't have an apology for everyone. Ross rejected a $100,000 fight request from rapper YBN Nahmir. “Nahmir, you’re not worth $100,000. You fell off, you suck at music. You failed your music career. I’ve got no disrespect to show, but that. Nahmir, you’re nothing. You’re nobody and your career sucks. He wanted 100 bands to fight. You are nowhere near 100 bands. And again, Kick paid Carti $2 mill. Hey, at least I got $2 mill to pay. You’re broke, f-ck you!” Ross said on stream.
However, Nahmir didn't take the shade lying down. “Don’t at me in no f-cking sh-t if you’re talking sh-t, because you gon’ get smacked in your f-cking mouth for it. You can hire all the security that you want to. It’s not going to work like that. Don’t disrespect my name and act like, ‘No disrespect, no disrespect!’ Shut the f-ck up, n-gga! How the fuck you talk sh-t then cop a plea in the same f-ckin’ video?” Nahmir retorted.

This look is bang-on racy.
Bianca Censori put on a daring display as she attended an event for husband Kanye West’s new album, “Vultures,” in Milan, Italy on Thursday, and along with her see-through ‘fit she showed off a brand-new hairstyle.
The Yeezy architect, 29, bared her chest and bottom in a black see-through look in a video shared by TMZ, with the outfit appearing to consist of a sheer tank top and a pair of tights worn as pants.

Censori — who normally wears her short hair in a slicked-back style — also rocked a new beauty look, showing off long, piecey bangs as she sang along to the “Gold Digger” rapper’s tunes at the event.
Her outfit was reminiscent of the sheer tights ensembles she wore on repeat while visiting Europe last summer, and it seems the couple is back for another Italian sojourn as he promotes “Vultures.”
West, 46, sported one of his usual baggy, all-black ensembles as he performed his song “Everybody,” a new twist on the Backstreet Boys hit.

Mrs. West wore a much more covered-up look as the duo, who got married in December 2022, headed out for a smiley outing in Florence earlier this week, with both wearing coordinating black hooded coats.
The couple also headed out in similar ‘fits to take in a football match — although West’s face was totally covered with a face mask and hood — and to enjoy a Valentine’s Day dinner in the Italian city last week.
With more stops on West’s album promo tour to come, there’s no doubt Censori will dare to bare again soon.",2024-02-23T15:31:56Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
"Kanye West Ran Up On By Fan During ""Vultures"" Listening Party, Ty Dolla Sign Springs Into Action","Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign have been doing everything they can to promote their brand-new album, Vultures. Overall, the first volume has been a massive success. Subsequently, they are looking to drop the second volume on March 8th and volume three on April 5th. However, no one knows for sure if these projects will actually be on time. After all, Ye has been known to delay things from time to time. Luckily, the abundance of listening parties suggests that the album is, indeed, on the way.
Recently, Kanye found himself in Italy for a new Vultures listening party. Ye and Ty Dolla Sign were out in the country with some of their friends. They even took in a soccer match. Last night, they hosted the official listening party where songs from the upcoming two volumes were played. Overall, the night was a huge success and the fans were loving it. However, there was a security breach at one point, as you can see below. In the video, a fan jumps the barrier and rushes onto the ground level where he approaches Kanye.

Ye immediately dodges the fan while Ty Dolla Sign springs into action. He was able to grab hold of the intruder and kept him there until the security were able to move in. It was a pretty wild scene, but that is the kind of thing you can expect at a Ye show these days. It's uncertain as to what the fan's intentions were. He could have either been looking to hurt Ye or he was simply just trying to get close to his idol. For now, there is very little information on what went down.

"Bianca Censori Debuts Bold Hairstyle And Films Kanye West Adoringly At ""Vultures"" Listening Event In Italy","Bianca Censori and Kanye West have become a power couple of sorts as of late. Overall, the two have been married for about a year. Moreover, they have gone on numerous adventures together and constantly seem to be joined at the hip. For instance, they were recently together in Italy as Kanye and Ty Dolla $ign were hosting a Vultures listening event. This listening event was done with the purpose of showing off tracks from the second and third volumes. As you can imagine, it was yet another success.
That said, Censori certainly made waves at the event thanks to her haircut and outfit. In the video below, acquired by TMZ, you can see that she has ditched her previous hairdo for something a bit more unique. The model has bangs that are paired with a short bob. It is reminiscent of what Uma Thurman had in the movie Pulp Fiction. Meanwhile, she could be seen filming from the crowd, and she did so adoringly and with lots of pride.

At this point, there is no telling which songs we will be getting on the ensuing Vultures volumes. Ye has played a ton of songs at these events, but he tends to cut things or even add them at the very last minute. Having said that, some of these listening events have been an exercise in futility. Hopefully, with the Vultures 2 release date on the horizon, we get some sort of tracklist soon. The fans are very curious, and most don't want to have to travel to Italy to get an idea on what is happening.

Kanye West e il Listening Party al Forum di Assago: prezzi alti per ascoltarlo,"The great hip hop swindle per citare il famoso titolo di un album dei Sex Pistols, “The Great rock’n’roll swindle” pubblicato nel ’79 ci permette di scrivere in poche righe la sensazione che si infila per le sinapsi quando esci dalla serata “Listening Party” di Kanye West (Milano ieri sera e Bologna il 24).
“Listenig Party”, una festa per l’ascolto di un disco, peccato però che per entrare alla festa o sborsi dai 115 ai 207 euro o stai a casina e il disco “Volture vol. 1” del suddetto te lo ascolti come fai di solito. Incappucciato, mascherato e con una buona mezz’ora abbondante di ritardo insieme al sodale Ty DOlla $ign col quale ha realizzato il nuovo nato (ci saranno altri due capitoli in uscita, vol. 2 e vol. 3), il ragazzo più che terribile del rap ha mostrato anche al Forum di Assago il look “nascosto” che ormai lo contraddistingue.
Che fosse lui era certo perché a pochi secondi dall’inizio un body Guard ha scortato in tribuna d’onore la compagna Bianca Censori, vestita, che ha assistito a buona parte del live. Dunque “Listening Party”, lo ripetiamo. Sì, sborsi dei soldi per ascoltare un disco con il tuo beniamino anzi, con i beniamini, perché con Ye (questo il nome che si è dato ultimamente ricordando, ma solo nel cambio di nome, il vezzo di Prince perpetrato anche da Puff Daddy o Snoop Dogg che ogni due per tre volevano li si chiamasse in un modo diverso dagli esordi) c’erano anche Playboi Carti, Quavo, Rich Kid e Jaden Smith e cosa succede? Che ascolti il disco con loro che FANNO FINTA di rapparlo. Ora se non è un prendere per i fondelli il pubblico questo, ditemi cosa lo è. Poi non stiamo a fare flanella sul fatto che la gente sa quello che compra, una cosa così è irricevibile. È un playback, cosa vietatissima negli States visto che sono saltate carriere per averlo fatto in pubblico, ma azione venduta a peso d’oro sia in America che da noi perché, vuoi mettere, ascoltare il disco con l’artista che lo ha fatto e si muove e si divincola come un ossesso davanti a te è una figata! Tutto il contrario e non usiamo l’aggettivo che indicherebbe perfettamente di cosa si tratta.Al Forum c’erano centinaia di persone che erano lì solo per scattare una foto e postare “io c’ero”, ai quali non fregava nulla che Kanye West fosse in playback o meno, che hanno indossato l’outfit più “in linea” con la star pur di farsi un selfie da condividere. Qualcuno, da qualche parte, lo ha già chiamato genio, preferiamo pagliaccio. Un pagliaccio che sarebbe anche in grado di fare qualcosa di buono nel rap così come ha dimostrato per anni ma oggi si nasconde (insieme al volto) dietro quintali di marketing capaci di fargli guadagnare soldi che puntualmente butta via grazie alle uscite antisemite da fan della Hitler Jugend o perché si candida a diventare presidente degli Stati Uniti.
Non starò a raccontarvi le decine di comportamenti borderline o di quanto ami mostrare la sua compagna seminuda mentre passeggia per le vie del mondo. Mi limito a scrivere che questo signore prende per i fondelli le generazioni Z e Alfa che ascoltano un pifferaio/depliant pubblicitario del quale si può fare tranquillamente a meno.",2024-02-23T08:07:00Z,https://www.lastampa.it,La Stampa
"Kanye West in concerto a Milano, la scaletta e cosa è successo","La prima data in Italia di Kanye West e Ty Dolla $ign per il Listening Party di Vultures I ha una regola: nessuna. Con il volto coperto da un passamontagna nero, Kanye si muove in un'arena vuota, senza palco e musicisti. Nessun microfono, un’ora effettiva di show. Con lui anche Dolla $ign, Playoboi Carti, Rich The Kid, Quavo, Playboi Carti, Lil Durk, Richthemind, Jaden Smith. Tanti gli ospiti in platea: oltre alla moglie Bianca Censori, anche Anna, Artie 5ive, Paola Zukar, Rose Villain, Tananai e Don Joe
Ready, set, Kanye. E con lui aspettatevi l’inaspettato. Non un’eccezione, ma la regola per Kanye West. Da sempre e per sempre. Una norma che, nonostante tutto, funziona. Ed è tutto merito suo, e della sua incredibile genialità. Può far discutere, come non piacere: ma quando si tratta di musica e progettualità in ambito artistico Kanye resta sempre sopra tutti. L’ha confermato ancora una volta, nel primo dei due Listening Party di Vultures I, primo capitolo del nuovo album a cui ha lavorato con Dolla $ign. Non un concerto, ma solo l’ascolto dei brani, con lui e Dolla $ign al centro della scena.
A pochi istanti dall’inizio i rumors dicevano che avrebbe suonato i brani di Vultures II, quindi quelli ancora ignoti ai più e non ancora pubblicati, e che al centro della scena Kanye avrebbe voluto chili e chili di sabbia, un’idea cambiata all’ultimo. Poi l'idea di portare duecento tifosi dell'Inter, progetto tramontato in breve tempo. Nulla di tutto questo: il non palco è completamente spoglio, un tecnico schiaccia play e si parte con Stars. Prime note del nuovo album, un faro illumina i due protagonisti: ovazione. Nessun microfono, nessuna parola per sessanta minuti di show: di fatto, sotto la maschera nera che copre il volto di Kanye potrebbe esserci chiunque: quando si muove per il Forum, fino ad arrivare alle transenne che lo separano dalle tribune, però, le persone presenti impazziscono. La scaletta ricalca esattamente l’ordine dell’album, e ci sono anche due brani che hanno fatto discutere, non più presenti nella pubblicazione: Everybody, in cui c’è il campione non autorizzato della canzone dei Backstreet Boys, e Good Don’t Die, che contiene parti di I Feel Love, successo del 1977 di Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder e Pete Bellotte che, non appena sentita la canzone, hanno incaricato i loro uffici legali di bloccarne la diffusione. Ufficialmente traccia numero 14, sulle piattaforme non c’è più. Ma dal vivo, o meglio al Listening Party (letteralmente una festa di ascolto) sì.
Talking il brano con la voce della figlia North (che non c'è) e il video dei Fratelli D'Innocenzo
C’è Talking, in cui si sente la voce di North, figlia di Kanye, che sembra voler calcare le orme del padre e lasciarsi alle spalle la parte Kardashian della famiglia, nonostante abbia appena dieci anni, e già al primo posto in classifica (di cui mamma e papà sono particolarmente felici). Lei, però, non è a Milano, ma solo nel video diretto dai Fratelli D’Innocenzo. C’è Back To Me e qui arrivano Quavo e Freddie Gibbs: ""I fell in love with you, we fell in love with you"" è l’inizio della traccia, a cui seguono Hoodrat, Do It, Paperwork, Burn e Fuk Sumn con Palyboi Carti. Tanti ospiti, tutti insieme, che si muovono nello spazio, si avvicinano alle transenne, salutano e poi tornano al centro della scena, ma pur sempre molto attenti a non togliere spazio e luce a Kanye, l’unico protagonista. Arriva anche Bump J per Vultures, mentre per Carnival, in cui sono stati campionati i cori dell’Inter, ci sono anche Playboi Carti e Rich The Kid. La parte finale dello show è di Beg Forgiveness, Problematic e King e qui avviene una breve invasione di campo, che si conclude in un secondo (quasi nessuno se ne accorge): un fan riesce a entrare nell'arena, ma viene immediatamente bloccato dalla sicurezza. Poi Kanye se ne va, confondendosi tra gli effetti del fumo, e le luci che restano spente. Perché la musica, rigorosamente di Kanye, continua.
La musica di Kanye continua, anche senza Kanye
La gente non se ne va e si scalda ancora di più quando sente i successi del passato dell’artista, da Can’t Tell Me Nothing a Runaway, Stronger e All of The Lights. Ma è pur sempre il popolo di Kanye a urlare il suo nome e chiedere di ascoltare e riascoltare Carnival. Prima di risentirla, però, a chiudere ufficialmente lo show di Kanye è l’uscita di scena di Bianca, sempre scortata da alcuni bodyguard.
Kanye a Bologna sabato 24 febbraio per il secondo Listening Party di Vultures I
Di Kanye si possono dire molte cose, ma non che non sappia far parlare di sé. Quando lo fa, e soprattutto quando non lo fa, e con una maschera. Della sua performance a sorpresa al concerto di Travis Scott a Roma, il 7 agosto 2023 al Circo Massimo, si era parlato a lungo, forse più che del live del rapper di Houston: Kanye bardato, Kanye che rappa due strofe, tutti impazziti. Tanto che molti speravano in un suo concerto nel nostro Paese, a più di dieci anni dall’ultimo in Italia. Poi l’annuncio di un live alla RCF Arena a Reggio Emilia in ottobre, progetto poi svanito ma poi arrivato a Milano il 22 febbraio. “Io c’ero” diranno in molti.
I came, I saw, I conquered dirà Kanye. Si replica domani, sabato 24 febbraio, a Bologna. E c’è chi dice che sarà uno show diverso. Ma da Kanye ci si aspetta sempre l’inaspettato.",2024-02-23T07:57:03Z,https://tg24.sky.it,Sky Tg24 
"Magician Created AI-Generated Biden Robocall In New Hampshire For Democratic Consultant, Report Says","Topline
Paul Carpenter, a New Orleans-based magician, claimed he was hired by a Democratic political consultant to create the AI-generated deepfake recording of Joe Biden that was sent to voters before the New Hampshire primary on January 23, which has now led to a criminal investigation and forced the FCC to ban AI generated robocalls.

Key Facts
In an interview with NBC News, Carpenter claimed he created the robocall, but did not distribute it. Carpenter said he was hired by Steve Kramer, a Democratic political operative who recently worked as a consultant for the presidential campaigns of Dean Phillips and Kanye West, who allegedly paid the magician $150 from a Venmo account linked to his father, NBC reported, citing transactions and call records viewed by the outlet. Carpenter said the task took him only 20 minutes using software developed by AI startup ElevenLabs—who have since suspended his original account—a claim that is consistent with a Bloomberg report that the company identified and banned the account responsible. Kramer has not publicly commented on the allegations, but told NBC News he would publish an op-ed that would “explain all” on Saturday. Kramer most recently worked as a consultant for the Phillips campaign for ballot access in New York and Pennsylvania in December 2023 and January 2024, but the campaign told Forbes that any actions he took to produce the New Hampshire deepfake were by his own volition. The campaign said they were “disgusted” by the allegations, and “absolutely denounce” Kramer’s actions if they prove to be real.
Key Background
In the days leading up to the New Hampshire primary on January 23, an estimated 5,000 to 25,000 residents of the Granite State received a robocall with a voice that sounded like President Biden. In the call, first reported by NBC News, the deepfake voice tells voters to “save their vote” for the general election in November and calls the primary “a bunch of malarkey,” using one of Biden’s most famous phrases. Shortly after the news broke, New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella announced his office would open a criminal investigation into the robocalls, telling residents of the state to “disregard the contents of this message entirely.” On February 6, Formella’s office announced the calls were traced back to two Texas-based companies: Life Corporation and Lingo Telecom. The recording eventually led to a unanimous ruling by the FCC this month that banned the use of AI generated voices in all robocalls by considering them “artificial voices” under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.
Contra
Carpenter claimed that he only created the recording and played no role in sending it to voters in New Hampshire. “There was no malicious intent. I didn’t know how it was going to be distributed,” Carpenter told NBC. The magician said the task only cost him $1 using the ElevenLabs software, and that it was easy to learn through YouTube tutorials. “It’s so scary that it’s this easy to do. People aren’t ready for it.”

Kenan Malik: ”Kanye West har inte svikit svarta människor”,"Det är en artig men aningen trött Kenan Malik som tar emot oss i det lilla konferensrummet på Kulturhuset i Stockholm. Han har redan avverkat två intervjuer och nu vill han ha mer kaffe, och framförallt mer socker.
– Jag behöver min dos till kaffet, säger han medan han häller tre paket i kaffekoppen utan att blinka.
Sedan Kenan Malik släppte sin bok ”Inte så svartvitt. En historia om ras från vit överhöghet till identitetspolitik” har alla velat prata med honom. Själv tar han uppmärksamheten med ro.
– Jag har ju skrivit om de här frågorna de senaste trettio åren, så för mig är det inget nytt. Men det som kanske gör folk nyfikna är att någon som själv är vänster, och dessutom brun, skriver en bok som kritiserar vänsterns identitetspolitik, säger han och tar en tugga på sin kanelbulle.
– Det finns en paradox i vårt samhälle som jag vill belysa, och den handlar om att samtidigt som medvetenheten om rasism ökar – och den moraliska avskyn inför den – så är vi alltmer besatta av att dela in människor i rasmässiga och etniska kategorier. Ju mer vi föraktar rasismen, desto hårdare håller vi fast vid olika former av rastänkande som egentligen förstärker den rasism vi vill bekämpa.
Som barn till indiska immigranter växte Kenan Malik upp i 70-talets Storbritannien där rasismen var brutal och att ”spöa upp pakistanier var en nationalsport”, som han själv uttrycker det. Efter att ha varit aktiv i politiska rörelser mot gatuvåld, polisbrutalitet och rasistiska utvisningar kom han i kontakt med arbetarrörelser och vänsterpolitiska grupper. Ju mer han lärde sig om social rättvisa, facklig kamp och universella rättigheter, desto mindre tänkte han på sin identitet som brittiskindier som avgörande för sitt politiska engagemang.
– Framför allt upptäckte jag att jag ofta kunde finna mer solidaritet och samhörighet med personer som hade en annan etnicitet eller kultur men som delade mina värderingar, än hos många av dem som delade min etnicitet eller kultur men som hade andra politiska uppfattningar, säger han.
Kenan Malik i Stockholm på Kulturhuset. Pratar om sin bok ""Inte så svartvitt"" med reporter Clara Lee Lundberg. Bild: Filippa Ljung
Kultur har ersatt ras
I sin nya bok ”Inte så svartvitt. En historia om ras från vit överhöghet till identitetspolitik” berättar han inledningsvis om hur rasbegreppet utvecklades under 1800-talet, och hävdar att det var rasismen som gav upphov till idén om ras, inte tvärtom.
– Vad jag försöker visa är att de miljontals afrikaner som blev förslavade inte blev det för att de var svarta, utan att de under upplysningstiden kom att betraktas som svarta – och som en separat ras som var underlägsen den vita – för att legitimera att de förslavades. Det var det enda sättet för den intellektuella europeiska eliten, som då hade börjat omfamnat upplysningstidens ideal om jämlikhet och frihet, att rättfärdiga det förtryck de utsatte de afrikanska slavarna för, säger Kenan Malik.
I den samtida idén om den vita arbetarklassen verkar vitheten ha större betydelse än den ekonomiska klassaspekten
För honom hör de historiska idéerna om ras och dagens identitetspolitik ihop, och i den andra delen av sin bok beskriver han hur förhållandet mellan ras och klass har förändrats i takt med den moderna identitetspolitikens framväxt.
– Det som hände under efterkrigstiden var att idéer om mänskliga skillnader alltmer började förklaras i termer av kultur istället för ras. Att människor tillhörde olika kulturer och att de kulturerna format vilka de är och hur de tänkte. Skillnaden var alltså att essensen i varje specifik grupp inte bars av dess biologi, som rasideologin ansåg, utan av kultur och historia. Med tiden har även klass blivit ett kulturellt attribut snarare än ett politiskt eller ekonomiskt sådant. När vi idag pratar om olika samhällsklasser definierar vi ofta dem genom vissa kulturella sätt att vara på, i den samtida idén om den vita arbetarklassen till exempel verkar vitheten ha större betydelse än den ekonomiska klassaspekten.
Identitetspolitiken ignorerar klass
Kenan Malik menar att vi måste göra upp med föreställningar om att människor med samma hudfärg eller etnicitet har samma erfarenheter och åsikter, och att vi borde känna mer samhörighet med dem i vår ”egna” etniska grupp.
En vit fabriksarbetare på Tesla har mer gemensamt med en svart fabriksarbetare på Tesla än med Teslas vita ägare Elon Musk
– Den antirasistiska identitetspolitik som jag kritiserar i min bok bygger ofta på just de här föreställningarna; att vår identitet ger upphov till våra värderingar, istället för tvärtom.
Identitetspolitiken tar inte heller hänsyn till klass och ignorerar det faktum att en vit fabriksarbetare på Tesla har mer gemensamt med en svart fabriksarbetare på Tesla än med Teslas vita ägare Elon Musk, säger han.
– Jag känner till exempel ingen samhörighet med vår premiärministern Rishi Sunak, trots att han också är brittiskindier som jag. För mig är det viktigare att regeringen i mitt land har samma politiska värderingar som jag, inte samma hudfärg.
Att människor med samma kulturella eller etniska bakgrund förväntas dela samma värderingar, blir extra tydlig när någon från en specifik utsatt grupp uttrycker åsikter som den inte ”borde” göra. Du tar själv upp exemplet Kanye West i din bok.
– Ja, och min poäng är att hans beteende och åsikter ses som ett svek mot svarta människor och den ”egna” gruppen, på samma sätt som Rishi Sunaks fördomsfulla immigrationslagar ses som ett svek mot den asiatiska gruppen. Men att Kanye West gör idiotiska uttalanden om judar och slaveriet, och Rishi Sunak inför hårda lagar, har ingeting att göra med att de ”sviker sin ras.”
Det handlar om att de är reaktionärer, och det vi borde göra för att bekämpa reaktionärer är att alliera oss med andra som kämpar mot reaktionärer, inte alliera oss med dem som råkar ha samma hudfärg, etnicitet eller kultur.
Du skriver också kritiskt om Black Lives Matter i din bok och lyfter fram det som du tycker är rörelsens svagheter. Varför var det viktigt att ha med?
– För att tanken som rörelsen bygger på; att det skulle finnas en slags global, svart identitet som för samman alla svarta människor på jorden, och att de delar samma erfarenheter, är problematisk. Låt mig exemplifiera: under våren 2020, några veckor innan George Floyd dödades och Black Lives Matter blev en världsomspännande antirasistisk rörelse, gick de anställda på ett städbolag i New Orleans ut i strejk. Majoriteten av de anställda var svarta afrikanamerikaner, och de protesterade mot låga löner, bristfällig skyddsutrustning (detta var under Covid-pandemin) och att de förvägrades rätten att organisera sig fackligt. Deras arbetsgivare var också svarta afrikanamerikaner som fått uppdraget av staden som en del i en antirasistisk mångfaldspolitik, berättar Kenan Malik.
– Men det som är intressant här är att ”Black Lives Matter” betydde helt olika saker för de svarta arbetsgivarna och för de svarta anställda. Städarna strejkade under hela sommaren av protestmarscher och demonstrationer, men när hösten kom tvingades de tillbaka till jobbet utan att något av deras krav hade uppfyllts. De svarta arbetsgivarna vann, de svarta anställda förlorade. Den här historien visar tydligt problemet med att tro att det finns någon slags gemensam identitet som samlar alla svarta människor, alla muslimer, alla hinduer, eller alla judar. Man ignorerar de splittringar som finns inom dessa grupper, inte bara klasskillnader, utan också andra uppdelningar såsom kön, sexualitet, religion och så vidare.
Kenan Malik i Stockholm på Kulturhuset. Pratar om sin bok ""Inte så svartvitt"" med reporter Clara Lee Lundberg. Bild: Filippa Ljung
Vad tror du att det beror på att många grupper ändå vill organisera sig separatistiskt, och att det finns en slags misstro mot att den som inte har samma erfarenheter inte kan solidarisera sig med din kamp?
– Jag tror att det beror på social pessimism. Under de senaste 30-40 åren har tanken på att kunna förändra samhället radikalt försvunnit i takt med att arbetarrörelserna har förlorat inflytelse och fackföreningar har krossats på många ställen. När känslan av social pessimism ökar så håller människor fast vid sina smala identiteter, de separatistiska grupperna har blivit som ett slags tillflyktsorter. Om man försöker bekämpa rasism samtidigt som man tror att den är omöjlig att utrota blir antirasismen en kampanj för symboliska förändringar, istället för materiella.
Men vita människor som grupp är ju till stor del skyldiga till att världen ser ut som den gör, och åtnjuter fortfarande privilegier endast på grund av att de är just vita?
– Jag skulle vilja problematisera uttrycket ”vita privilegier”, som många antirasister använder nuförtiden. Ofta menar man att alla vita, oavsett bakgrund, är priviligierade för att de inte blir diskriminerade på grund att sin hudfärg. Men att slippa bli diskriminerad är inte ett privilegium, utan en rättighet!
Dessutom tar man inte med klass i analysen av privilegier, säger Kenan Malik.
– Ett exempel som gör detta tydligt är den enorma ökning av antalet människor som fängslats i USA den 70-talet. Om man tittar på alla inkomstnivåer är skillnaderna mellan fängelsetalen för svarta och vita väldigt små. Svarta är överrepresenterade generellt, men det är för att sannolikheten att fängslas ökar om man har lägre inkomst. Anledningen till att svarta påverkas oproportionerligt mycket av det är för att rasismen har gjort dem oproportionerligt fattiga. Men det är inte rasismen i sig som leder till fängelse, det är klass. Är du en vit person som hoppat av high school är det 15 gånger större risk att du hamnar i fängelse än om du är en svart person med högskoleexamen.
Så vad tycker du vänsterns antirasister ska fokusera på istället för vita privilegier, separatism, och identitetspolitik?
– Jag tycker att vi ska fokusera på solidaritet, jämlikhet och yttrandefrihet, och fundera på hur vi kan frigöra oss från både ras- och identitetstänkandets bojor.",2024-02-23T05:00:00Z,https://www.etc.se,etc.se
Kanye West Once Said He Couldn't Make an Album Better Than The Beatles,"During Kanye West's early career, he said he could not make an album better than The Beatles. He revealed what it would take to outperform the Fab Four.
In recent years, Kanye West has said numerous things that are offensive beyond belief. During West’s early career, he said something far less controversial — that he could not make an album better than The Beatles. He revealed what it would take for another band to outperform the Fab Four. The “I Love It” rapper explained what made him stand out from the competition.
Kanye West said Beatles albums had connected with people their whole lives
During a 2008 interview with MTV, West had the gall to criticize other artists for displaying too much bravado. “Whenever bands come out and say, ‘This album is better than The Beatles,’ it is impossible to make an album better than The Beatles unless you’ve got 30 years,” he explained. “Beatles records — people have known them their whole lives … hopefully five years from now people still play ‘Love Lockdown’ and people still play the records that I’m doing right now.”
“Love Lockdown” came out in 2008. In 2024, it’s still a famous song. Who knows if it’ll still be prominent in 2038 like West wanted. What we do know is that “Love Lockdown” inspired a lot of other rappers. Artists like Drake and Childish Gambino followed the blueprint of the song to create other tunes about heartache with sparse synthesizer beats.
West had a coherent theory as to why he was so popular. “The reason why I’m one of the big artists is I was always interested in that melody,” he said. “I was like,” Yo, let me stop f****** around, I’m just gonna, like, make it be all melody. My lyrics are from the same perspective. It’s not no R&B get-down-on-your knees-and-beg-a-girl type bulls***. It’s still, like, guy music, but it’s swag on it.”
The “Heartless” star also revealed what his intentions were as a musician. “I’m trying to make those songs that are just classic songs,” he said.
Kanye West worked with a Beatle but here’s why he might not overshadow the group
West would later try to make Beatles songs of his own by collaborating with Paul McCartney on the tracks “FourFiveSeconds” and “Only You.” The former became a huge hit, while the latter barely received any attention, considering its star power.
The real question is this: Has West made an album as good as a Beatles album? That’s a question of taste. However, The Beatles, even at their most inflammatory, were never as offensive and hateful as West. Considering all the horrid things West has said recently, it’s not out of the question that his songs will fade into obscurity within the next few decades.
How ‘Love Lockdown’ performed
“Love Lockdown” became a big hit. It reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, staying on the chart for 23 weeks. It remains one of the rapper’s biggest tunes. The track appeared on 808s & Heartbreak, which is arguably his most important and influential record. 808s & Heartbreak topped the Billboard 200 for a single week, staying on the chart for 39 weeks. A lot of 2010s music was inspired by 1980s synth-pop, and that whole revival can be traced back to 808s & Heartbreak.
West remains one of the most impactful rappers ever, even if he’s never made an album better than Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.",2024-02-23T04:50:11Z,https://www.cheatsheet.com,Showbiz Cheat Sheet

HOT IN HAIR Bianca Censori shows off change to her appearance as she cozies up to husband Kanye West at Milan restaurant before show
KANYE West's wife, Bianca Censori, has drastically changed her look, switching it up completely.

Paparazzi captured the married couple as they sat together while they enjoyed a meal at the Four Seasons hotel in Milan on Thursday.
They grabbed a bite before the Stronger rapper's, 46, listening party for his new album Vultures I.
Compared to when celebrity photographers caught her out with her A-list hubby in the past, Bianca, 29, looked much different.
No longer did she have her platinum blonde slicked-back haircut, but instead, she had her tresses dyed a dark-black color.
Her hair appeared styled into a sleek Razor Bob Cut with bangs.
Bianca's outfit, however, was as provocative as her ensembles usually are.
Her boobs and butt were seeable in the sheer black get-up she sported to Kanye's event.
Bianca's revealing style is rumored to aggravate Kanye's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, 43.
The Hulu star reportedly demanded that Kanye tell Bianca to cover up around their four kids: North, Chicago, Psalm, and Saint.
North is 10, Chicago is six, Psalm is four, and Saint is eight.
DRAWING THE LINE
Although she has an amicable relationship with the Australian native, The Kardashians star reportedly wants Kanye's wife to dress appropriately around her children, according to The Daily Mail.
""Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids,"" a source told the outlet.
Bianca Censori dances in barely-there nude bodysuit at Kanye West's Vegas party as fans ask 'what is she wearing-'
""She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.""
Kim's demands came after her eldest daughter doodled a naked drawing of her stepmother.
INAPPROPRIATE IMAGES
Last week, Kim shared a photo of her daughter's notebook on TikTok.
On the page, North had written several things she was grateful for that day.
""What three things are you grateful for today?"" the page was titled.
Underneath, she listed several things about her father's new album, Vultures I, including one of his songs, Carnival.
After the list, North drew her rendition of the album cover and depicted her stepmom facing the wall completely naked and sporting a teeny tiny thong.
THE BACKLASH
In an online thread, critics slammed the rapper for supposedly traumatizing his kids with his racy shots of their stepmother.
""Imagine your dad posting this,"" argued one critic.
""I feel terribly for his children and any other child in the family. They will experience the traumatic effects of this psychopath,"" another critic added.
""Kanye - if you don’t want your daughter exploited in this manner when she grows up - maybe you shouldn’t exploit your wife in such a manner. Kids grow up to do as you do,"" a third critic ranted.
""What is wrong with you, Kanye? Parading her around like a piece of meat! So degrading!"" a fourth person wrote.
""Man, I really did used to look up to you. The fact that you expose your girl’s body for other men to look at. It’s a huge disgrace, and you know that too,"" a commentator chimed.

"North West, 10, Charts on Billboard with Music Debut on Dad Kanye West's Album 'Vultures 1'","Everyone in the Kardashian family is famous, and North West seems to have inherited the family's penchant for fame. At the young age of only ten, North West has achieved a significant professional milestone by becoming one of the youngest singers to ever chart on the Billboard Hot 100, per The Mirror. This month, the young rapper made her musical debut by appearing on her father Kanye West's most recent album, Vultures 1. With the infectious song Talking, North made her rapping debut. ""It's your bestie. Miss, Miss Westie. Don't try to test me, it's gonna get messy. It's gonna get messy. Just, just bless me,"" she sang.

Given that North's song debuted at number thirty on Billboard's Hot 100 list, it appears that the song has done well with listeners. Talking was North's first-ever appearance on the Billboard chart, and only a few others have surpassed her as the youngest artist. The youngest performer was Jordy, a French vocalist who recorded Dur dur d'être bébé! (It's Tough to Be a Baby!) at the age of five. With Fingertips - Pt 2, Stevie Wonder became the youngest soloist to reach the top of the list at the age of just 13.
North appeared in the music video for the song, in addition to rapping on it. North is shown at the beginning of the video getting her hair done while mouthing the lines. North was seen in the video with her father and wore an all-black outfit in the song created in association with Ty Dolla $ign. Talking is only one of the album's sixteen songs that have made it onto the chart; a staggering sixteen songs have made it.
Mom Kim Kardashian praised her 10-year-old in an Instagram Story with a screenshot she posted from X, formerly Twitter. ""My baby,"" the proud mom of four wrote across the screenshot, per PEOPLE. In her debut solo cover story for the Fall/Winter 2023 issue of i-D, the preteen discussed her career goals. The preteen is set on a few different vocations, but she still has plenty of time to alter her mind. ""A basketball player, a rapper. Well, when I was 7 I wanted to be a boxer,"" she told the outlet. ""But now I don't want to be a boxer. I'm going to do art on the side.""
The youngster explained her goals for three years from now, ""When I'm like, 13, I want to walk dogs, to make money to buy art supplies, because everything around here is so expensive. So a rapper, a basketball player, and I'm going to make artwork that I sell."" She also wants to inherit her parents' businesses, saying, ""Also, one day I want to own Yeezy and SKIMS, and I want to be a business owner.""",2024-02-23T03:46:17Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign's Apple Music Bio Mentions Anthony Fantano, Fans Think It's A Hack","As if Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign didn't face enough issues already with releasing their album Vultures on Apple Music, it seems like someone hacked their artist bio. Either that, or they wanted to make the best troll artist description they could come up with while taking shots at the Internet's busiest music nerd. Moreover, on their artist page on the streaming platform under the moniker ¥$, their bio is a bizarre and most likely fake Q&A excerpt that goes over some curious claims, including references to music critic Anthony Fantano of The Needle Drop. Hats off to whichever fan was cheeky enough to include this and do so successfully, or to Ye and Ty Dolla to taking very legitimate criticism of their work (particularly the former's) with some sense of humor.
We'll include the whole bio here in case it really is fake and Apple Music takes it down soon. Before that, this is notable because Anthony Fantano called Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign's Vultures ""unreviewable"" for its quality and the antisemitic background behind it. That caused an absolute uproar online from Ye stans and melonheads alike. Whether you agree or not, it's fair to say that things definitely went a little too far in folks' responses to this.

Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign Raise Eyebrows With Likely Hacked Apple Music Bio
""In the artist's words:,"" Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign's bio begins. ""'Describe one of your earliest musical memories in detail.' ¥$'s first music experience as a group was listening to our second single 'Cool beat 1' and working on the critically acclaimed song 'Back to Me.'"" Also, the bio asks the duo their three all-time favorite albums on Apple Music, and it mentions The College Dropout, Vultures, and Featuring Ty Dolla $ign. Here's the first Fantano reference, made when ""answering"" a question about their favorite song of theirs on the platform. ""'CARNIVAL' is the most popular Ye Dolla song by far. As stated by the YouTube famous music reviewer Anthony Fantano stated, 'This song is absolutely amazing and is a shining light in Ye and Ty's respective catalogues.'"" If the backlash didn't spoil it, he never said this in the first place.
Meanwhile, here's how the ""bio"" closes out. The bio ""asks"": ""'What's one of the most memorable moments in your career so far?'"" Their ""response"": ""For one, being the #1 collaboration album worldwide in more countries than ever know. Secondly, being the best selling and most successful independent album on streaming platforms, and third being the first album to be known Unreviewable by Midtano."" Yikes. Check out their Apple Music page to see if it's still there. Otherwise, log back into HNHH for the latest news and updates on Kanye West, Ty Dolla Sign, and Anthony Fantano.

"Joe Budden Thinks Kanye West Fumbled On ""Vultures"" Despite Other Praises","Everybody's got something to say about Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's new collaborative album Vultures. As such, it's no surprise that one of the most popular and wide-reaching voices in hip-hop culture right now has a hot take for the masses. Moreover, The Joe Budden Podcast recently reviewed the project on their latest episode, with its main host expressing that he overall likes the LP. Specifically, he had great things to say about the production and many of the duo's featured guests on this supposed series' first installment. But the biggest problem that the Slaughterhouse MC had with Vultures is none other than the Chicago creative behind it.
""This is some bad rapping on here,"" Joe Budden shared with his show's co-hosts. ""I’m only talking about Kanye West. Freddie Gibbs went cr*zy. All the rappers I heard went cr*zy, except for Kanye West... He’s just chanting."" Elsewhere, he added some loose thoughts on a few moments here and there, remarking that some of Vultures' cuts are ""a little too funky"" and ""too Yeezus-ish,"" in his opinion. Still, the New York MC had some praise for the production overall, and for other specific guest appearances.

The Joe Budden Podcast Reviews Vultures: Watch
""He showed his a** on the production,"" Joe Budden posited. ""His production is unbelievable on here. ‘CARNIVAL’ on down is nuts... I’m still a little thot inside. Dawg, what a creative flip of ‘Back That Azz Up’ [on 'DO IT']. I need to hear this in the strip club loud. I absolutely love ['BEG FORGIVENESS'], I don’t care that this beat stays the same. This is cr*zy."" Although there are certainly many admirable qualities about Vultures, it's hard to deny that Kanye West is not as consistent as he's been on past releases when it comes to his own performances. This isn't even accounting for how much you condemn or ignore his recent controversial behavior concerning antisemitism, the far right, and his peers.
Meanwhile, Vultures resulted in a big payout for Ye and Ty Dolla, so all this discussion probably means little to them. They dropped this independently and likely plan on dominating as much as they can through this method. We'll see whether this results in an uptick in quality, or if Joe's take on Vultures 2 will be harsher. To find out, stay up to date on HNHH for the latest on Kanye West, Ty Dolla Sign, and Joe Budden.

Kanye West Restocks YZY GAP Collab Items For $20 Each,"Kanye West is apparently making a lot of money off of Yeezy right now following a Super Bowl ad and a brand-new album with Ty Dolla $ign. Moreover, he recently brought back items from his YZY GAP collab on his website, selling hoodies, sweatpants, and the like for $20 each. This led to a big sales spike due to previously high-priced items getting a significant cut, so it's natural to assume that this wouldn't be the end of this strategy. Whether or not the Chicago creative's extracurricular behavior and statements holds you back from copping a piece or two is a personal decision. However, it's clearly not one that concerned a lot of fans who contributed to this success.
Furthermore, Ye's profits from the release of Vultures, and those belonging to Ty Dolla, seem quite impressive. According to a Billboard estimate, their independent drop has resulted in almost a million in profits for them without having to give any cuts to a record label. Despite the promotional and marketing power behind the album lessening, fans still took the project to No. 1 on the publication's albums chart. We'll have to see just how much more success it finds in the near future.

Kanye West Brings Back YZY GAP With A Price Cut
Both artists had pretty cut-and-dry reactions to hitting this top spot, which points to the misleading nature of this ""independent"" claim. While nonetheless impressive, it's also the kind of thing that only massive artists can pull off without hurting their pockets in the long run. Although it would be great to see more artists find more freedom within their label contracts and release limitations, it seems like only artists like Kanye West have the pockets and reach to sidestep this outright. Perhaps we can start thinking not just about how artists can reach this at an individual level, but also about how they can support each other and create wider change.
Meanwhile, do you think you'll cop some of these new (well, restocked) YZY GAP drops? Are you heading to one of their European listening parties this week? Whatever the case, let us know in the comments section down below. Also, stick around on HNHH for the latest news and updates on Kanye West.

"Kanye West Comments On Label Contracts Resurface After ""Vultures 1"" Success Independently","Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's collab album Vultures did not come out in collaboration with a record label, and that means the artists earned a whole lot more cash than usual. Moreover, Billboard recently released a report on their estimated earnings from this release method, only partnering with distributor Label Engine to put the record out commercially. After its No. 1 debut on the Billlboard 200 chart, we can assume that they netted a lot of money from not having to split this with a label. As such, the outlet believes that they took home about $986,000 from this supposed series' first installment.
Furthermore, this made them look back at Ye's previous 2020 comments on label contracts. He advocated for artists to earn at least 80% of their music's profits and full ownership of their copyright that they can lease out to labels and publishers for a limited time. Label Engine, Vultures' distributor, indicates that clients get 82.5% of revenue, something that Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign have plenty of leverage to raise in their favor. But the outlet thinks that this number (under the assumption that 5% of earnings went to the distributor) goes up when considering global streams and publishing.

Of course, these numbers hinge on streaming success and some additional sales for a slight boost. This situation is a big change from Kanye West's old contracts, such as his 14% royalty rate for The College Dropout. In earlier contracts, he would've had to reach this commercial success seven times over to reach the same amount of profits Vultures netted. Sure, this is also only possible for someone of the Chicago rapper's magnitude, plus Ty Dolla's own success and that of their featured guests. As such, this is independent in the technical sense of the term; Ye is no indie darling on the industry hustle.
Also, we must consider all the money behind promotional, budgetary, and marketing benefits that partnering with labels provided in the past. Given the Yeezy creative's antisemitic behavior, this extra push that his albums had to become mainstream cultural benchmarks isn't there anymore. But add onto this clothing sales, and there's been a lot of revenue to collect around Vultures, for better or worse. For more news and the latest updates on Kanye West, Ty Dolla Sign, and Vultures, come back to HNHH.

Le Milan AC tape sur Kanye West et sa cagoule à San Siro pour se moquer de l’Inter Milan,"MARCO BERTORELLO / AFP MARCO BERTORELLO / AFP
FOOTBALL - Le Milan AC ne pouvait pas passer à côté de cette occasion. Après que Kanye West a assisté mardi 20 février au match de Ligue des champions de son rival historique, l’Inter Milan, le club au maillot rouge et noir a parodié la tenue du rappeur américain.
Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les images ci-dessous, ce dernier a en effet assisté à la rencontre entre l’Inter et l’Atlético Madrid, aux côtés de son épouse australienne Bianca Censori, en portant une cagoule noire, comme il en a pris l’habitude lors de ses dernières apparitions publiques.

Un concert à l’Accor Arena à Paris dimanche
L’Inter Milan pourra se consoler de ce petit affront numérique en se disant que son rival, lui, ne dispute pas la Ligue des champions cette saison, mais simplement l’Europa League. Ce jeudi 22 février, le Milan AC tentera d’ailleurs de se qualifier pour les huitièmes de finale de la compétition sur le terrain de Rennes, après un match aller remporté 3-0 par le club italien à San Siro.
Kanye West, lui, fera encore parler ce week-end en Europe. Il se produit en effet ce dimanche à l’Accor Arena à Paris lors d’un événement surprise annoncé tardivement. Il ne devrait pas s’agir d’un concert classique, mais d’une « Listening Experience », soit « une expérience immersive unique en présence de l’artiste », peut-on lire sur le site de Bercy.
L’événement est conçu autour de son dernier album, Vultures 1, disponible depuis le 9 février, après maints reports. Classé en tête des charts américains, ce disque a été élaboré avec son compatriote Ty Dolla $ign.

This old post of Kim Kardashian had her 363 million followers wondering whether or not she may have some beef with her ex’s new wife, Bianca Censori. After her previous husband Kanye West had settled down with someone new, it seemed like the KUWTK star is still a tad bitter about her former lover being ‘stolen’ by Censori as per The Sun.

In the video, Kardashian constantly zoomed in and out of the frame from the opposite side of an Alex Vervoordt hall—an amalgam of elegance with an exuberant essence of luxury.
The choice of music was something fans took careful note of. She synced her video with her ex-husband’s Moon from his album Donda. A part of the lyrics said, “Don’t leave so soon. How could I get through?”, a possible reference to the time he tried to win his ex-wife back regardless of the cost. The lines of the song seem to have echoed not just with West but perhaps also with his wife. “Never forget all the memories” is another line that highlights how the SKIMS mogul just maybe wants both West and Censori to be aware of.

A popular platform on Reddit dedicated to spilling the tea about The Kardashians star shared a thread featuring a screenshot from the story. The headline read, ""Kim’s story with a Ye song added"". As mentioned earlier, a recording of her story was accordingly discussed on the page. Users of the social media platform theorized situations. One of which included that maybe ""Kim was sending a thinly veiled subliminal message"" to the American Boy rapper.

North West schreibt mit ihrem ersten Song Musikgeschichte!,"Ist das der Beginn einer großen Karriere? Als älteste Tochter von Kim Kardashian (43) und Kanye West (46) steht North West (10) schon seit ihrer Geburt im Rampenlicht. In der Vergangenheit hatte die Zehnjährige erklärt, dass sie davon träume, genau wie ihr Papa, als Rapperin durchzustarten. Vor wenigen Tagen veröffentlichte sie gemeinsam mit Kanye und Ty Dolla Sign ihren ersten Song – ein voller Erfolg. Mit ihrem Rap-Debüt schreibt North nun Geschichte!
Der Song ""Talking"" stieg in den Billboard Hot 100 Charts auf Platz 30 ein. Damit zählt North zu den jüngsten Künstlerinnen, die jemals in der Chartliste vertreten waren. Ihre Eltern sind auf den Erfolg sichtlich stolz. In ihren Instagram-Storys teilen Kim und Kanye jeweils einen Artikel, der über Norths Erfolg berichtet. ""Mein Baby"", schreibt die The Kardashians-Protagonistin zu ihrem Post.
North scheint ein angehender Star zu sein. Im November 2023 zierte sie zum ersten Mal das Cover eines Magazins. Für die britische Modezeitschrift i-D posierte die TikTokerin im lässigen Oversize-Look. Im Rahmen ihrer Titelstory gab sie auch ihr erstes Interview.

Kanye West Takes ‘Savage’ Jibe at the Kardashians in New Track and Fans Feel Awful for Them,"After much anticipation, the highly awaited collaborative album Vultures 1 by Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign has finally hit the shelves. This 16-track project is the rapper's epic comeback since his previous album, Donda. Among the tracks on the album, Keys To My Life has emerged as a focal point of speculation among fans. Fans have already come up with their theories as they relate the album lyrics as a direct jibe at ex-spouse Kim Kardashian, and her mother, Kris Jenner.

In Keys To My Life, West and Ty Dolla $ign deliver cutting lines that have led fans to interpret them as veiled references to the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Lines such as ""Look at what I stumbled on, another man chillin' on your couch with pajamas on,"" and ""Thought I was the only one, how dare you have a man in your house eatin' Papa Johns?"" have sparked intense speculation about the inspiration behind the lyrics. Some fans believe that West's mention of maternal figures in the song, such as ""Hold me like your only son,"" could be a nod to Kris Jenner, suggesting a strained relationship between the rapper and his former mother-in-law.

One Reddit per The U.S. Sun, user remarked, ""I'm sure I'm being naive but the only reports we heard of him cheating while they were still married probably came from Kris. Whereas, Kim was rumored to be with Drake (that was in his own songs) and she supposedly propositioned Meek Mill who Kanye said Meek told him directly."" Another user speculated, ""Tristan Thompson is the one eating papa johns on her couch,"" alluding to Khloe Kardashian's ex-boyfriend.

Despite once being a high-profile power couple, Kardashian and West's romance ultimately came to an end, culminating in Kardashian filing for divorce in 2021 after a contentious legal battle. Relationship expert Louella Alderson shared insights with Mirror, suggesting that given West's history of erratic behavior, Kardashian is unlikely to be surprised or deeply affected by his recent outburst. Having dealt with West's unpredictable actions and public statements for years, Kardashian may have developed resilience to his behavior.

Alderson further added, ""It may just serve as a reminder to Kim of why they ended their marriage and the day-to-day challenges she no longer has to deal with. Kim knows what Kanye is like and this will likely be seen as just another moment of him acting out."" But that's not all, since the expert added, ""When it comes to their children, they seem to have a good co-parenting relationship and are able to put their differences aside for the sake of their kids. As long as Kanye respects their children's well-being, it's unlikely that this outburst will greatly affect their co-parenting relationship.""",2024-02-22T08:56:14Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Los ultras del Inter cantan en el último disco de Kanye West,"""Después del partido, Kanye quedó muy impresionado por la pasión de los ultras, la sincronización y las bengalas"", comentó el mánager Richard Santoro, quien hizo de enlace y facilitador de Kanye durante su estancia en Italia, a Rockit.
""Me llamó después de un tiempo. Todavía estaba en Italia. Me dijo: 'me gustaría que subieras a 2.500 fans al escenario"", narra Santoro. La idea era que formasen parte de una fiesta en el recinto Campovolo de Reggio Emilia el 20 de octubre, la cual, finalmente, no se celebró.

Exposed Anti-Semitic Kanye West Rant,"Topline
A man accused of hacking into Fox News—eventually obtaining and leaking— footage of a now-infamous anti-Semitic conversation between Kanye West and Tucker Carlson was indicted Thursday on a dozen charges of criminal activity more than six months after FBI agents searched his home and seized his computers.

Key Facts
Tim Burke, a freelance media consultant and journalist, was arrested Thursday and charged with one count of conspiracy, six counts of accessing a protected computer without authorization and seven counts of intercepting or disclosing wire, oral or electronic communications, according to documents on file in federal court for Florida's middle district. The indictment accuses Burke of hacking into computers owned by “a multinational media company headquartered in New York City"" and obtaining unaired clips ""which included interview discussion between show host and guest.” Though the court documents don’t explicitly mention Fox News, Tucker Carlson or Kanye West by name, the Tampa Bay Times has confirmed the charges relate to the obtaining of behind-the-scenes footage of the ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" show that were leaked to, and published by, Vice and Media Matters in October of 2022. The clips feature unaired segments of an interview with West that included his making antisemitic comments and repeating conspiracy theories, including that “Planned Parenthood was made… with the KKK to control the Jew population” and referencing the theory that Jewish people control the nation’s financial institutions. Leaks also included footage of Carlson making inappropriate comments to an on-set makeup artist (he asked if “pillow fights ever break out” in the women's bathroom) and referring to a woman as “yummy” (Carlson was fired by Fox News in April 2023). Mark Rasch, Burke's attorney, did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment Thursday but told Rolling Stone Burke was acting as a journalist when he legally obtained the Fox News clips, and his actions are therefore protected by the First Amendment.
Key Background
Fox News aired a friendly, two-part interview with Carlson and West in October of 2022, which included claims by the rapper that the body-positive movement is a ""genocide of the Black race"" and that he was pressured into staying quiet about his support of Donald Trump ahead of the 2016 election. Speaking about the interview, Carlson told his audience, “We’ve rarely heard a man speak so honestly and so movingly about what he believes.” Days later, Vice obtained and published parts of the interview that were edited out of the broadcast, including his comments about Jewish people. The news broke at the same time West’s Instagram and Twitter accounts were frozent for antisemitic posts that were soon deleted. Carlson and Fox News were swiftly criticized for editing out West's ""antisemitic meltdown.” The incident revived criticism of the network, including the resurfacing of an investigation by the New York Times that found Carlson had created “the most racist show in the history of cable news” in his time with Fox. Over the years, Carlson’s controversies have included claims he made comments that likened women to dogs and defended statutory rape and theories that the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 was a “false flag” FBI operation intended to make conservatives look bad. Days before his departure, Fox had agreed to a $787.5 million settlement in a lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems over the network’s coverage of the 2020 election.
Tangent
The investigation against Burke has sparked a wave of support from First Amendment advocates. After the FBI raid of Bruke's home was revealed, more than 50 organizations signed onto a letter to the Department of Justice demanding transparency into the investigation, which they called an infringement of protected journalistic activity. Burke has said he obtained the clips from public websites used by Fox News to upload unencrypted live streams, and that the URLs would have been available to anyone with publicly accessible login credentials. But federal prosecutors have questioned whether Burke is a journalist, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
Crucial Quote
“Journalists cannot be expected to refrain from using the internet to find newsworthy content just because powerful companies would prefer to keep it private,"" Freedom of the Press Foundation advocacy director Seth Stern said at the time of the organization’s letter.
Surprising Fact
The Carlson tapes weren't the first time Burke's journalism has made national news. In 2013, he was on a team of Deadspin journalists who broke the catfishing story that revealed Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o was apparently duped by a fake girlfriend. Heisman runner-up Te’o had told reporters he was fueled to college football greatness by the deaths of his grandmother and girlfriend Lennay Kekua, but Deadspin later found his entire online relationship with the woman was a hoax perpetrated on Te’O. A trans woman named Ronaiah Tuiasosopo was later revealed to be behind the catfishing scam. In 2022, Netflix released a two-part documentary on the scandal called “Untold: The Girlfriend Who Didn’t Exist,” which features Burke.

What Does Its No. 1 Bow Mean?,"If you thought Kanye West‘s time in the mainstream was done following his most recent and most impactful round of controversies — wearing a “White Lives Matter” shirt and making repeat antisemitic comments (which has since posted a public apology in Hebrew for), among other offenses — the reception for new album Vultures 1 should dissuade you of that notion pretty quickly.
Vultures, co-credited to West and longtime collaborator Ty Dolla $ign, debuts atop the Billboard 200 this week — moving 148,000 equivalent album units, despite missing all of that tracking week’s Friday (and some of its Saturday) with the messy rollout of its release, and drawing a mostly favorable response from longtime fans (though more mixed notices from critics). In addition, the album lands all 16 of its tracks on this week’s Billboard Hot 100 chart, led by the No. 3-bowing “Carnival,” which seems well on its way to being the album’s breakout hit.
Is the largely positive reception justified? And what does the debut mean for Kanye’s comeback? Billboard writers discuss these questions and more below.
Trending on Billboard
1. Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures 1 debuts atop the Billboard 200 with 148,000 first-week units. On a scale from 1-10, how happy do you think Ye and Ty should be with that debut number?
Kyle Denis: 8. For Ty, this is his first No. 1 album and the biggest sales week of his career – it doesn’t get much better than that. For Kanye, I have to imagine that this feels like a triumph. Vultures I suffered numerous delays, got yanked from DSPs mid-tracking week and served as his first attempt at an independent release. Despite all those challenges – and the general cooling on Kanye the Artist™ in the wake of his string of antisemitic comments and hate speech – he still scored his 11th No. 1 album and shifted nearly 150,000 units in a week. Nonetheless, we can’t ignore that audiences aren’t consuming Vultures as voraciously as they have Kanye’s previous solo albums – 2018’s ye, 2019’s Jesus Is King and 2021’s Donda – all of which crossed the 200,000 units mark in their first week of release.
Carl Lamarre: If I’m Ty Dolla $ign, I’m ecstatic and through the roof. So, I’m flying high at a 10 if I’m him, considering this is his first-ever No. 1 on the Billboard 200. If I’m Kanye, I’m probably at an 8.5-9. I bumped Ye’s points down because I’m thinking about Mr. West’s ego and fragile psyche. Though this is his 11th consecutive No. 1 on the Billboard 200, this is Ye’s lowest opening week of his career (Kids See Ghosts did 142,000 but was billed as to its eponymous group with Kid Cudi in 2018). 2019’s Jesus Is King landed at 264,000 equivalent album units, while 2021’s Donda netted 309,000 equivalent album units. I don’t think Ye will lose sleep over the drop-off, especially after nailing a No. 1 album independently amid his antisemitic comments. For now, I’m sure Mr. West feels Teflon.
Michael Saponara: 10. I think as long as they were well into six-figure sales and debuted at No. 1 this was a major victory for Ye and Ty – especially with the project being released independently and facing sampling and distributor issues messing with its availability on streamers throughout the week.
Damien Scott: Ye and Ty should be happy that Vultures 1 debuted at No. 1. Putting aside all the pump fakes on release day, which saw the album being taken down and re-posted on various streaming services, Ye’s acidic language and antics over the past year or so turned himself and anyone who associated with him radioactive. So, there was no telling how people would respond to a new project from him, especially one that’s been so sloppily rolled out. The lukewarm reception to the album’s advance title track didn’t help matters. So, I’ll say 10 — this is about as good as things could have went for Ye and Ty.
Andrew Unterberger: I’ll say an 8. It’s not the kind of head-turning number West pulled up with previous releases — some of which were much less commercial-sounding than this — but it’s still an A-list number for 2024, especially in an incomplete first week. For a guy who’s spent the past few years being as toxic as Ye has, I’m sure even that level of embrace feels like a major win. (And obviously Ty should be thrilled with his first-ever No. 1 on the 200, even though it feels like he’s getting it in more of a supporting role.)
2. In addition to the album debuting at No. 1, the album’s focus track “Carnival” debuts at No. 3 on the Hot 100, the highest-charting single for either artist this decade. Do you see it being a long-lasting hit, or will it fade relatively quickly following its bow?
Kyle Denis: I think it will probably stick around the upper half of the chart should its streams remain consistent. “Carnival” is a song that works best live, so should a tour follow the duo’s Rolling Loud date, Kanye and Ty could have a genuine smash on their hands. On the other hand, “Do It” stands out as a possible hit thanks to that “Back That Azz Up” interpolation, as does the North West-assisted “Talking,” but that’s already had its day in the sun.
Carl Lamarre: I can see “Carnival” in the top 20 for the next few weeks, especially with Kanye and Ty taking Vultures on the road with their upcoming headlining performance at Rolling Loud. We haven’t seen many new hip-hop songs crash the top 20 this year except 21 Savage’s “Redrum” and Flo Milli’s “Never Lose Me.” With the fierce combination of Ye, Dolla $, Playboi Carti and Rich the Kid, this song will be living at the top of the playlists for ragers and mosh-pit fanatics, especially with festival season underway.
Michael Saponara: Getting added to RapCaviar after having the most-streamed song of the week is a positive development in that regard, as Ye has been pretty much shut out of any radio play thus far with Vultures 1. If he does deliver on second and third volumes of Vultures, I believe “Carnival” will get washed ashore, but it’s far from a guarantee another batch West and Ty Dolla tunes are on the way in the coming weeks.
Damien Scott: A few factors make it difficult to predict whether “Carnival” will stay on the charts or not. The biggest one is Ye’s unpredictability when it comes to following through with any plans he’s shared with the public. Judging from social media it seems like his team is going to try to capitalize on the moment by trying to institute a challenge and maybe shooting a video. But who knows. He could just as easily forget about the whole album and move onto Vultures 2 or whatever he wants to do next.
Andrew Unterberger: Certainly sounds like a smash to me. For better or worse.
3. Though critics’ takes have been mixed, Vultures seems to have the strongest reception among Kanye fans perhaps since The Life of Pablo. Do you see this album as a true return to form for Ye, or is that reception more a testament to the quality of his other recent releases?
Kyle Denis: An album whose best tracks can barely stand shoulder-to-shoulder with most of The Life of Pablo is simply not a true return to form for Ye. I think the messy, sprawling tracklists and middling dips into different genres on his last few projects make Vultures feel like a promise of pre-2018 Kanye… but this is not that. While there are flashes of brilliance on the record, Vultures feels too redundant to be a great Kanye West record.
Carl Lamarre: Lyrically, this was a porous showing by Ye compared to previous projects. Donda was a very slept-on album. Shed the fat and cut down the tracks by a few, and you have unquestionably one of the decade’s strongest hip-hop albums. As for the current album at hand, Ye’s production prowess remains God Level and is one of the reasons why he skates through the controversies. Anybody can be a beatmaker, but Ye’s musical arrangements, placement of guests, and usage of Ty’s voice as the lead instrument for Vultures made this album a solid showing.
Michael Saponara: It’s a return to form in the fact this is the most “finished” body of work Ye has had since TLOP. He achieved the balance of having Vultures act as a fit inside the 2024 rap zeitgeist while also still being a sonic pioneer and curator for others to catch up to. I just have a tough time comparing Vultures to albums from well over a decade ago in West’s discography and think it’s an unfair bar to set.
Damien Scott: I don’t think Ye ever lost his form. He’s taken a bunch of diversions and clearly lost focus for a long moment. But I don’t think he ever forgot how to make music. Donda was a bloated mess of an album that had a bunch of half-finished sketches and ideas, but mixed in among those skeletons were moments of real brilliance. Vultures 1 is his most focused work since in years— all the songs are complete and seemingly finished; and the tracklist is not an unruly 20+ songs. The whole thing seems more considered than anything he’s released since TLOP.
Andrew Unterberger: Front to back, it’s probably both his most-satisfying and least-interesting album since Pablo. Like most of that album, Vultures feels sonically enveloping and masterful but lyrically sneering and obnoxious. For all hate that Ye got, give me a song as difficult and revealing as “I Thought About Killing You” or “Ghost Town” over pretty much any of the pit-starting anthems here.
4. Despite being a co-billed artist on Vultures, Ty Dolla $ign has largely been relegated to a supporting role by most discussions of the album. Do you think it’s fair to mostly treat this as a Kanye album, or does that shortchange Ty’s contributions to the project?
Kyle Denis: Kanye is clearly a more dominant vocal presence on Vultures, but Ty’s contributions are just as interesting and important. However, I find it more pressing to think about Ty’s involvement from a marketing/cultural standpoint. There’s a reason that Kanye did not return with a solo album. There’s a reason that he chose Ty Dolla $ign to embark on this journey alongside, and there’s a reason Ty agreed to the ride. We’re aware that Kanye is probably the most controversial mainstream musician in the world, so for his first full-length project since his worst phase of public perception yet to be a joint record is intriguing. To a certain extent, Kanye needed a less polarizing name attached to the record, but how does Ty reconcile the music with Kanye’s past few years?
Vultures may sound more like a Kanye solo album than a proper collaborative project, but we would be remiss not to properly grapple with the record in the way it was presented to us.
Carl Lamarre: It’s what I said in answer No. 3: Ye is undoubtedly the conductor of this train. It goes beyond raps because he weaves in Ty and fits him in certain pockets. Ty is elite, but his bread and butter have always been hooks and features. What I would love to see for Ty — so his career doesn’t strictly lead with being Kanye’s sidekick — is having his next solo album executive-produced by Ye. That would be most beneficial for him as a solo artist.
Michael Saponara: From a cultural standpoint, West was always going to dominate the conversation with all of the controversy surrounding him for the last couple of years. As for the music, Ty deserves a ton of credit for steering the ship at times and keeping Ye from going creatively off the rails on some tracks. West and Ty have proven to be cerebral collaborators and have a propensity to bring the best out of those they’re working with.
Damien Scott: I think that shortchanges Ty’s contributions to the album. The album is unmistakably a Kanye project in fit and finish. It’s kind of trippy listening to it because it’s an ouroboros of Ye musical history. All of the sounds and styles were originated or popularized by Ye at some point over the past 20 years, whether it’s the stripped down industrial maximalism of Yeezus or warm soulful bounce of TCD. It’s all here. But Ty does a good bit of heavy lifting, keeping the album balanced, making it more palatable and grounded than if Ye was left to his own devices. That must have been a tough task.
Andrew Unterberger: Love Ty and he is a welcome presence for much of Vultures — but the number of co-stars who could stand next to a personality as huge and self-centering as Kanye’s and not get chewed up along with the rest of the scenery is a short one, and does not include him.
5. West has obviously dealt with a tremendous amount of backlash in the past few years given his recent inflammatory statements and controversies. What does the debut of Vultures say to you about Kanye’s current standing in the mainstream, and how it’s changed in recent years (if at all)?
Kyle Denis: To me, Vultures shows that Kanye is too big to disappear – at least for right now. He’ll always have an audience, and the ratio of dedicated fans to nosy detractors will fluctuate in tandem with his public perception. Moreover, Vultures could be a signal that people are generally weary of Kanye and his shenanigans. Even with its bevy of release-week controversies, Vultures didn’t feel as culturally dominant as Donda or Pablo or even Jesus Is King, to a lesser extent. Of course, these aren’t 1:1 comparisons, so maybe we will have to wait and see how the other two Vultures projects fare.
Carl Lamarre: No matter how deep Kanye sinks, fans will continue to throw him a life raft. Many have chucked deuces to Mr. West after his “slavery is a choice” and anti-semitic comments. Deservingly so, Ye lost endorsements and fans for his ignorance and hateful comments. Still, his legions of fans find ways to separate the art from the artist and come in droves every time a new album drops. That speaks to Ye’s musical career and its lasting impact on many people, especially as he’s now two decades deep into it.
Michael Saponara: It speaks loudly to those who have supported him and will continue to do so with an imaginary line being drawn in the sand. There’s still clearly a massive appetite for Ye, as Rolling Loud added an extra day for him and Ty Dolla $ign to perform next month. That doesn’t seem like it’s destined to change in the near future either, as long as the music/clothing remains up to par and culturally influential. What’s different is the scale at which he operates now creating independently, without the backing of industry titans such as Universal, Adidas and Balenciaga.
Damien Scott: While Vultures 1 went No. 1, it didn’t perform nearly as well as Donda. For example, it was the most streamed album in 24 hours on Spotify in 2021. This isn’t that. His antics and statements have done a good deal of irreversible damage. He’s still a massively famous artist, though — one who hasn’t performed live regularly in a long time, so it’s not surprising to see fans clamoring to see him in concert and at Rolling Loud. That said, I don’t think Vultures has done much to change his standing in the mainstream. But Ye has. His recent apology and his renewed focus on his music and apparel makes it seem as if he’s turned a corner. How long that will last is anyone’s guess.
Andrew Unterberger: Kanye was never going to totally disappear from the mainstream until he actively chose to do so. If nothing else, the more crowd-pleasing nature of Vultures (and the mild contrition he showed in advance of its release) shows that even as a now-independent artist, Ye has no interest in operating at the fringes — he still wants to be in a place to move the culture.

Ob er den Siegtreffer gesehen hat?","Mailand (Italien) - Ausgerechnet in der Stadt der Mode leistete sich Kanye ""Ye"" West (46) eine Outfit-Sünde der ganz kuriosen Sorte. Beim Champions-League-Duell zwischen Inter Mailand und Atlético Madrid tauchte der US-Rapper am Dienstagabend nämlich komplett vermummt auf.

Aktuell befindet sich der Hip-Hop-Superstar in Norditalien, wo er am Donnerstag und Samstag zwei Konzerte spielen wird.
Um sich die Zeit bis zu den Auftritten zu vertreiben, besuchte der Musiker, der sich inzwischen nur noch ""Ye"" nennt, das altehrwürdige San Siro zum Königsklassen-Kracher der ""Nerazzurri"" gegen den Spitzenklub aus der spanischen Hauptstadt.
Begleitet wurde der 46-Jährige dabei von seiner Ehefrau Bianca Censori (29) sowie den Rap-Kollegen Playboi Carti (27) und Rich the Kid (31). Allerdings dürfte kaum jemand auf seine Entourage geachtet haben.
Denn der vielfache Grammy-Gewinner trug zum Stadiongang eine schwarze Sturmhaube ohne Aussparungen. Lediglich das Sichtfeld bestand augenscheinlich aus einem etwas dünneren Stoff.
Trotzdem fragten sich zahlreiche Zuschauer in den sozialen Medien, ob der Paradiesvogel den entscheidenden Siegtreffer von Marko Arnautovic (34) in der 79. Minute überhaupt gesehen habe, da er die befremdlich wirkende Kopfbedeckung offenbar für das gesamte Spiel aufließ.",2024-02-21T19:55:00Z,https://www.tag24.de,TAG24
Kanye West Sports New Face Mask At Pro Soccer Game In Italy,"For a while now one of Kanye West's hallmarks has been sporting masks to hide his identity while in public. That began with ski mask style full coverage mask which he reportedly designed himself and came with a variety of different colors. More recently he's popped up sporting a horror movie style hockey mask. The masks haven't done a great job at hiding his identity given how identifiable of a feature they've become.
Regardless, he's continued sporting face coverings and even debuted a brand new one at a soccer game earlier this week. West is currently in Italy where he has two planned listening parties for his new album with Ty Dolla $ign Vultures later this week. While there he decided to stop by a pro soccer game where fans got a look at his newest ski mask style face covering. This one came with an eye window for West to see through and he wore it with a dark hoodie over top. Check out some of the pictures of him in attendance below.

Despite all the controversy, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's new album garnered quite a bit of attention. VULTURES 1 just debuted at the number one spot on the Billboard 200 and the entire tracklist of the project landed on the Hot 100. That included ""Carnival"" which soared all the way to a number 3 debut.
Despite the big success of the album, Ty and Kanye don't seem particularly excited about the numbers. After an entire week of claiming the album was #1 in dozens of countries, he had a pretty brief reaction to learning that it actually topped the Billboard 200 albums chart. What do you think of Kanye West's newest facemask? Do you think the masks still do a good job of hiding his identity or do they make him even more identifiable?

Dopo la 'presenza' della Curva Nord nelle 'Choir Vocals' di due pezzi del nuovo album del rapper di Atlanta, 'Vultures 1', la rappresentanza della tifoseria nerazzurra presiederà anche ad uno dei due concerti italiani del cantante, ieri ospite d'eccezione a Inter-Atletico Madrid. Il cantante e produttore discografico statunitense sarà in concerto al Forum di Assago e all'Unipol Arena di Bologna, e proprio nella prima delle due tappe italiane, quella in programma per domani sera al Forum ci sarà la speciale partecipazione della Curva Nord.
""Stasera ci saranno le prove generali e domani sera i tifosi nerazzurri saliranno sul palco del Forum"" fa sapere la Gazzetta dello Sport che parla di 500 ultras nerazzurri a intonare cori, ""quelli che il rapper di Chicago ha messo in due delle canzoni del suo ultimo album"". L'idea di far partecipare la Curva al concerto è nata ieri a Kanye e il suo entourage, piacevolmente travolti dalla forza emanata dal tifo nerazzurro durante la partita contro i colchoneros.

Ye scores No. 1 album as scrutiny of antisemitic comments continues,"A new album from rapper and fashion designer Ye has hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, a return to the top of the music industry despite ongoing scrutiny of his past antisemitic comments.
Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and rapper Ty Dolla $ign released “Vultures 1,” their first joint project as the duo ¥$, more than a week ago. The rappers had been teasing the album, which Ye initially said would be released last December, for months.
""Vultures 1"" marks Ye's 11th No. 1 album.
The feat comes just over a year after Ye went on several antisemitic rants in late 2022. The fallout was swift as brands, including Adidas, Gap and Balenciaga, cut ties with the rapper. He was also dropped by his talent agency CAA.
The backlash toward Ye reached a fever pitch in December 2022 after he praised Adolf Hitler in an interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. This was a breaking point for many fans who had already begun to move away from the artist because of his antisemitic remarks. Moderators of Ye subreddits and fan pages shared that his behavior brought in a wave of new alt-right members to the fandom, making the communities “hell.”
Still, the release of “Vultures 1” appears to demonstrate that Ye has retained a sizable portion of his fan base. The rollout for “Vultures 1” was rocky, with accusations of unauthorized samples, chaotic listening parties and more antisemitic rants, according to Rolling Stone. Ye later apologized to the Jewish community for his “outburst” on an Instagram in a post written in Hebrew. That post was among the many deleted after Ye wiped his account ahead of the album release.
Even after the album dropped, the release had issues. “Vultures 1” was removed from Apple Music for several hours on Thursday before being restored, according to The New York Times. The outlet also reported that music distributor Fuga came out against Ye on the same day, saying that it had passed on distribution for “Vultures 1” but that a client had used its services to deliver the album to streaming companies anyway, which went against Fuga’s policies.
Despite the controversy surrounding the album’s release, “Vultures 1” made it to the top of the charts. It has received praise from fans on X, although many reviewers have panned the album. Music review publication Pitchfork gave the album a middling 5.8, and British music and culture website NME gave it two stars, adding that the album is ""mired in misogyny.""
Popular YouTube music critic Anthony Fantano, who has criticized Ye’s music and public remarks in the past, called the album “unreviewable.” He also said listeners can’t “separate the art from the artist” because several lyrics in the album are antisemitic.",2024-02-21T17:21:21Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
"North West Becomes One Of The Youngest Artists To Chart On Billboard, Kim Kardashian Reacts","Kanye West shocked the world a couple of weeks ago when he dropped ""TALKING"" on Instagram, then eventually on YouTube and streaming. It is one of the more touching moments on VULTURES 1, a record that does not have many of them. One of the reasons why is due to the charismatic and cute performance by Ye's oldest daughter North West. It was the second and final track to be released ahead of the album and it is one of the strongest cuts in our opinion. Now, after a week of Ye and Ty Dolla $ign's effort being out, charting placements are now here. Mommy and daddy have to be proud of North West as she becomes one of the youngest to chart on Billboard.
This news follows a couple of days after the album went number one on the Billboard Hot 200. Both headlining acts reacted in ho-hum fashion to finding out as if they expected it to happen. To get the spot it did, VULTURES 1 sold nearly 150,000 copies. It marked Ye's 11th number one debut and became Ty's first.

Kardashian, 43, parked the pricey ride in an outdoors parking lot –– just outside the white lines, which some fans pointed out on social media –– overlooking several trees while it rained.
“Cool Carpool Mom,” she captioned the Instagram Story on Tuesday.
Per Tesla’s website, the Cybertruck comes in three different trim levels ranging from $57,390 to $96,390 based on estimated gas savings. Page Six has reached out to Kardashian’s rep for comment.

North West & Bump J Debut on Hot 100 With Features on 'Vultures 1',"North West and Bump J are both officially Billboard Hot 100-charting artists thanks to their featured appearances on Ye (formerly Kanye West) and Ty Dolla $ign’s new album, Vultures 1. The set by the pair debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 (dated Feb. 24) with 148,000 equivalent album units earned in the U.S. in its opening week (Feb. 9-15, following its Feb. 10 release), according to Luminate.
North West is featured on the album’s “Talking,” which debuts at No. 30 on the Hot 100 with 12.33 million official U.S. streams.
Trending on Billboard
At just 10 years old, North, the eldest child of Ye and Kim Kardashian (who divorced in 2022), is now one of the youngest acts ever to reach the chart. Among other precocious charted talents, Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s daughter Blue Ivy Carter hit the Hot 100 at just 7 years old in 2019, thanks to her featured turn on Beyoncé, Saint Jhn and Wizkid’s “Brown Skin Girl.” She made her overall chart debut just after making her debut in the world, as her coos are heard on Jay-Z’s “Glory,” featuring B.I.C. (her initials). The song hit Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in 2012, making her the youngest billed artist ever on any Billboard chart.
“Talking” isn’t just North West’s first entry on the Hot 100, but on any Billboard list. She also debuts at No. 32 on the Emerging Artists chart.
As for Bump J, the Chicago rapper hits the Hot 100 for the first time thanks to his featured credit on Ye and Ty Dolla $ign’s “Vultures,” also featuring fellow Chi-Town rapper Lil Durk. The song debuts at No. 34 with 12.28 million streams.
Bump J (real name Terrance Boykin) has been releasing music for more than two decades. After releasing multiple mixtapes, he signed a deal with Atlantic Records in 2005 and released his solo single “Move Around,” which Ye produced. The track reached No. 91 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs in March 2005. His career was detoured in 2007 when he was arrested for an armed robbery. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2009 and was released through a plea deal in 2017.
Since then, he’s released two full-length projects: 606 God in 2018 and I Don’t Feel Rehabilitated in 2019. Plus, he teamed with Chicago rapper G Herbo in 2017 for “Crown” and again in 2021 on “Revolutionary,” also with Hit-Boy. The latter track is from Judas and the Black Messiah: The Inspired Album, which hit No. 1 on the Soundtracks chart and No. 12 on the Billboard 200.",2024-02-21T15:49:06Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Kanye West est dingue, la star du rap foudroie le monde du football","Dans : Ligue des Champions.

Les tribunes du stade Giuseppe-Meazza étaient combles mardi pour le match de Ligue des champions entre l'Inter et l'Atlético de Madrid. Kanye West a fait forte impression, même si les tifosi milanais se demandent à quoi joue la star du rap.
Les 73.709 spectateurs qui avaient un ticket pour le huitième de finale aller de Ligue des champions entre l’Inter et l’Atlético de Madrid ne voulaient pas en perdre une miette et avaient les yeux grands ouverts. Enfin au moins 73.708 d’entre eux. Car dans la tribune VIP un curieux spectateur a attiré les regards, puisqu’il portait une cagoule noire qui lui couvrait la totalité du visage, et que pendant plusieurs minutes, ce supporter avait même des lunettes de soleil sur sa cagoule opaque. Malgré cela, la sécurité milanaise n’est pas intervenue car cette personne n’est autre que Kanye West, la star américaine du rap, ancien compagnon de Kim Kardashian, ils s’étaient mariés au château de Versailles, et dont l’un des enfants est devenu supporter de l’Inter, au point de faire venir son père au stade pour assister à ce choc européen.

Ces dernières années, l’artiste de 46 ans a malheureusement fait parler de lui pour avoir pris des positions politiques indéfendables, lesquelles lui ont valu de perdre de très nombreux contrats, dont celui très rémunérateur avec Adidas. Depuis, Kanye West est rentré dans le rang niveau provocation, même s’il arbore toujours des looks improbables, comme celui de mardi soir à Milan. La semaine passée, il avait été vu avec la même tenue tandis que sa nouvelle fiancée portait, elle, un imperméable transparent sans aucun autre vêtement dessous. De quoi assurer la promotion d'une série de concerts que le rappeur donnera dans les prochaines semaines en Europe, dont un le 25 février à Bercy pour présenter son prochain album Vulture 1.

Kanye West Declares Himself The GOAT In Unique Fashion,"Kanye West has been having a successful run as of late. After months of teasing his project Vultures, he finally came out with the album. Overall, the project is a bit of a mixed bag. Not everyone is a fan, however, there are still those out there who dig it quite a bit. After all, Ye is one of the most legendary hip-hop artists ever. Even when he creates some bad will for himself, there will still be people out there to defend him. One would just have to look at the Anthony Fantano situation to see what we mean.
Additionally, Ye is looking to make waves in the fashion world as he renews his efforts with Yeezy. On top of all of this, he is dropping Vultures 2 next month and Vultures 3 will be coming out in April. Needless to say, the Ye stocks are rising, and he wants to take full advantage of this. In fact, Kanye is leaning into his legendary status with a new update to his Tidal profile page. As you can see below, the artist has changed his photo to a GOAT. Of course, he is trying to say that he is the Greatest Of All Time.

If you were to ask a lot of contemporary music fans, they would likely have Ye up there in the GOAT conversation. As far as MCs are concerned, he probably doesn't crack the top 10. However, as an overall artist, he is certainly top 5. Considering his most recent output, there is no denying that the quality has fallen off compared to his early work. That said, his fanbase is so big that no matter what he drops, there will be people out there who love it. This is a phenomenon that is very unlikely to change.
Let us know what you thought of Vultures, in the comments section down below. Additionally, stay tuned to HNHH for more news and updates from around the music world.

Kanye West Was Once Criticized for This ‘Disturbing’ Element in His Photo With his Wife Bianca Censori,"Editor's note: This article was originally published on August 21, 2023. It has since been updated.
Critics of Kanye West once expressed their discomfort after noticing a peculiar aspect in a picture of the rapper with his wife, Bianca Censori, taken during their recent trip to Italy. As depicted in the initial images shared by the Yeezy Mafia Instagram profile, Bianca, aged 28, and Kanye, aged 46, were captured in an embrace, holding each other closely.
Bianca had chosen to don a set of light blue, semi-transparent tights that allowed visibility and were accompanied by white stilettos. Complementing the ensemble, she had opted for a corresponding light blue bodysuit, notable for its transparent quality. The backless design of the bodysuit was particularly pronounced, revealing a significant portion of her side chest due to its minimal coverage, per The U.S. Sun.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by YEEZY MAFIA (@yeezymafia)
Adding to the ensemble, she adorned her head with what seemed to be a ribbon, along with a pair of tan tights. The artist behind Flashing Lights opted for an oversized, all-black attire, and notably, he was barefoot—a detail that drew the attention of certain fans. The image of the married duo was shared on a well-visited online forum dedicated to the Kardashians, evoking a sense of discomfort among fans due to the absence of footwear.
Swiftly, fans didn't hold back in expressing their repulsion towards Kanye's decision to go without shoes. Detractors seized the opportunity to share their opinions on a Reddit discussion board, where they criticized the rapper for his unconventional style preferences, according to Mirror.
A particular individual raised a question: ""If he doesn’t have his own brand of shoes does he just go barefoot?"" ""It's so gross. He's got millennia-old grime on those dirty feet,"" added a second. While a third said: ""His lack of shoes right next to those torturous contraptions on her feet double the anxiety, for me. Imagine getting your toes stepped on by those things,"" While another speculated: ""Isn’t he scared of like tetanus or something?? City streets aren’t exactly known for their cleanliness.""

According to reports from The U.S. Sun, observers found an additional amusing aspect in the same picture that has been discussed by critics. Sharp-eyed enthusiasts noticed what seemed to be an electrician kneeling in the background of the photo. Fans couldn't help but chuckle as they highlighted the presence of an individual dressed in what appeared to be a worker's uniform, seemingly attempting to repair something within a cabinet in the background of the building, while the superstar couple took center stage in the foreground.
One fan noted on Reddit: ""I'm thrown off by the guy in the back, who looks like he’s praying? (Or possibly cleaning or puking,"" as another added: ""Obsessed with him thinking he is so cool and avant-garde, and there is a f**king plumber just working in the shot,"" while a third posted, ""Idk what the guy is doing lol. But who knows where they are, so out of touch they always look ridiculous and out of place.""",2024-02-21T14:04:15Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

Che Kanye West sia un soggetto particolare, lo si era capito da anni. Dalle sue interviste, spesso deliranti (“Vedo del buono anche in Hitler”; “Vogliono impiantarci dei microchip per impedirci di varcare le porte del Paradiso”) , dai suoi proclami, dalle sue candidature a presidente degli Usa. Senza dubbio, Ye, come si fa chiamare, è uno che si prende molto sul serio e crede fermamente nelle sue capacità e potenzialità. Pure troppo. Basti vedere come cerca di plagiare le sue compagne per comprendere il suo tipo di mascolinità.
Talmente convinto del suo potere e della sua popolarità, tra l’altro, da girare ormai mascherato, temendo che la folla, riconoscendolo, possa mai dare adito a esternazioni di fanatismo estremo.
Arrivato in incognito in Italia con la moglie Bianca Censori si è recato a San Siro, alla partita Inter-Atletico Madrid. Ovviamente col viso coperto e (a suo credere) irriconoscibile. Come se la presenza che non passa certo inosservata della moglie – quanto lui si copre, lei “scopre” – non bastasse a urlare a caratteri cubitali: “Eccoci, siamo arrivati”.
D’altronde quando si candidò alle elezioni presidenziali del 2020 (e stava ancora con Kim Kardashian) diceva: “Come qualunque altra impresa che ho affrontato, sono destinato a vincere“. Ecco, nemmeno quel risultato (non) ottenuto ha sminuito il suo ego e le sue farneticazioni di onnipotenza.
Un genio, un messia, un curatore delle anime, Kanye è convinto di essere tutto questo e lo dice senza alcuna modestia.
“Sono strambo, totalmente sincero e talvolta anche inappropriato. Se dicessi di non essere un genio starei mentendo, a me stesso e a tutti voi”. “Sono un genio creativo. Non c’è un altro modo per dirlo”. E ancora: “Andate ad ascoltarvi tutta la mia musica. È la chiave per l’autostima. Se siete un fan di Kanye West, siete un fan di voi stessi. Crederete in voi stessi grazie alla mia musica, io sono soltanto lo shot che vi fate per credere di più in voi stessi”.
“Non mi definirei nemmeno un rapper, sono più un messaggero che un rapper. Vorrei dire alla gente ‘Venite ad aiutarmi, aiutate tutti, potete vincete insieme a me’, vincerete insieme a me”.

Darum gehts Rap-Superstar Kanye West schaute sich die Champions League an.
Er war bei Inter Mailand gegen Atlético Madrid dabei.
Dabei trug der 46-Jährige eine schwarze Kopfmaske.
Inter Mailand gewann mit Nati-Keeper Yann Sommer im Tor 1:0 gegen Atlético Madrid. Für weit mehr Schlagzeilen als dieser Sieg sorgte der Auftritt eines Zuschauers. So gab sich Rap-Superstar Kanye West die Ehre. Der 46-Jährige war in Begleitung seiner Frau Bianca Censori sowie Rap-Kollegen Playboi Carti, Rich The Kid und Schauspielsohn Jaden Smith.
Am meisten zu reden gab jedoch Wests Aufmachung. Der US-Amerikaner trug eine schwarze Kopfmaske, offenbar während des gesamten Spiels. So machten sich die Fans schnell darüber lustig, wie viel Ye, wie er auch genannt wird, wohl vom Spiel gesehen hatte.
Andere fragten, wohl zu Recht, ob es wirklich West war, der unter der Maske steckte.
Wests Besuch bei Inter Mailand ist jedoch keine Überraschung. So arbeitete der Rapper für sein letztes Album «Vultures 1» mit den Inter-Ultras der Curva Nord zusammen, deren Sprechchöre kommen auf zwei Tracks vor.
«Ich kann das nächste ‹Vultures›-Album kaum erwarten, wenn er über Lautaro Martinez und Antoine Griezmann rappt», witzelte ein Fan in den sozialen Medien.

Kanye West and Bianca Censori’s marriage doing better after success of new album Vultures 1,"Were Kanye’s constant public appearances and monologues with the press a dire sign of a vulnerable man, or stunts to promote his latest album?
Ye, as he is now known, has been spotted holidaying in Italy with Aussie wife Bianca Censori after the release of his long-awaited album Vultures 1.
The couple were reportedly seen hand in hand, and in good spirits after the last few tumultuous months spent in America.
Post the February release of the album, Kanye shared a video in Las Vegas about his relationship with Censori, touching on her scantily clad appearances on his social feeds.
Camera Icon Kanye West declared that his wife Bianca Censori will be wearing even less clothes in 2024, after sharing a slew of racy snaps to his Instagram account. The controversial rapper - known as Ye - posted three separate pictures of Bianca to his 18.4M followers, with one captioned: 'No pants this year'. On Tuesday, the 46-year-old hitmaker showed off his wife who donned a skimpy, fur bra top, which revealed her ample assets, and nothing else but a micro thong. She also had her hair wrapped up in a black headscarf to highlight her barefaced features. Credit: Instagram / Instagram

“I delivered the album. And people still in my comments talking about, ’Why you posting your wife?‘ Cause she makes me happy.
“That’s why y’all happy with the music because I’m happy. You understand?” Kanye revealed.
While the polarising rapper claims to adore his younger love and credits her for his happiness, sources close to Censori have suggested her outlook has changed considerably after the financial success of the album.
According to Daily Mail, insiders revealed the 29-year-old advised her man against making anti-Semitic slurs at a listening event earlier in the month — with such behaviours causing widespread controversy in recent times.
The source said the couple experienced a lovers’ tiff which held Censori back from attending the New York event on February 9, claiming their relationship was “hanging by a thread”.
Censori, who wed the 49-year-old rap star in late 2022, apparently “knows that everyone thinks of her husband — and his recent outbursts were causing her to question everything,” the source said.

However, whether the couple’s reported rift was staged or sincere, the source admitted: “But then, all of a sudden, his album is a success and she is back to being a loving adoring and supportive wife.”
Concerns from loved ones that the Aussie architect is only with her American beau for his money are arguably validated by the claims.
The insider continued: “To her friends and family, this just screams what her real motivation behind all of this is – his money.”
With the constant outbursts and ever-changing social media communications, it’s impossible to know what’s true and what’s trash.
Some say the couple are in a partnership, with Censori profiting directly from her lover’s success through creative influence over his brand Yeezy as an architect and model.

The couple were in great spirits, holding hands and looking very affectionate with one another as they headed to lunch at Sunset Towers after.

The troubled icon claimed he made $19 million in revenue last week following the Super Bowl after splashing $7 million on an advertisement for his fashion brand and latest album.
But millions is chump change to billionaires, and a number of brands cut ties with the embattled star in 2022 after his anti-Semitic remarks, which put an end to the artist’s billionaire status.
Speaking to TMZ about his album after the Super Bowl, Kanye revealed, “I’ma just be honest with y’all. I was two months from going bankrupt, and I put everything I had into it.”
Vultures 1 — the first release in a planned trilogy — features the song Carnival which made it to the number one spot on Apple Music’s Top 100: Global chart.
However, the album has since been removed from the platform after Billboard claimed Kanye had uploaded his music to other distributors without the appropriate permission.
Fans can still listen to the star’s latest music on Spotfiy, minus the track Good (Don’t Die) which is currently being questioned over “copyright infringement” claims made by Donna Summer’s estate.

Kanye West tried — and failed — to go incognito at a pro soccer game Tuesday.
The 46-year-old rapper was spotted covering his entire face with a black face mask while watching the game in Milan with his wife, Bianca Censori.
He matched his face-concealing garment with a black hooded jacket, which he wore over his head.

Censori, 29, mirrored her husband’s look as she sported a black turtleneck and trench coat for the outing. She completed the look by slicking back her dark bob.
Just one day prior, the couple was seen sporting similar outfits in Florence, Italy. West, however, opted to go without the mask.
The “Runaway” rapper and Censori — whom he married in December 2022 — have reportedly moved to Italy to develop a new clothing line.
Despite being a fan of face masks over the years, West has been sporting them even more as of late.

Most recently, the Yeezy designer turned heads at the 2024 Super Bowl by wearing a vintage Alexander McQueen mask that featured a three-dimensional white crucifix between the eyes.
Before that, he was photographed at his son Saint’s basketball game on Feb. 2, wearing a white mask that resembled the one worn by “Friday the 13th” killer Jason Voorhees.
West also wore a Jason Voorhees-inspired mask in the album artwork for his brand new “Vultures 1” album. The cover also features Censori facing away from the camera while wearing a tiny piece of cloth to cover her derrière.

The father of four — who shares his kids with Kim Kardashian — appeared to wear the same face covering during his surprise performance at Travis Scott’s Circus Maximus Tour show in Orlando, Fla.
Aside from his eye-catching style, West made headlines recently for claiming he was nearly bankrupt after facing backlash for his antisemitic comments in late 2022.

“I was two months from going bankrupt, and I put everything I had into it,” he told TMZ last week while speaking of the success of “Vultures 1.”
“We moved to Italy. We moved to the factories, and we survived. We survived through the cancellation. We’re back No. 1,” he said, referring to the consequences of his remarks, which include being dropped by his label and losing several of his big-name brand partnerships.

“Vultures 1” is currently topping the Billboard 200 chart despite some of its questionable lyrics, including one line that says, “And I’m still crazy, bipolar, antisemite / And I’m still the king.”
In defiance of the backlash he received over his controversial comments, the Grammy winner has shown no signs of remorse.

Benzino Channels Kanye West With Conspiracy-Filled “Drink Champs” Rant,"Benzino went on an antisemitic rant during his viral appearance on Drink Champs, earlier this week. While he’s been making headlines for his emotional meltdown about feuding with Eminem and his daughter, Coi Leray, he’s now facing backlash for spreading conspiracy theories.
“Let’s build each other,” he said. “Let me tell you about the Jews that Kanye [West] talked about. The Jews were the slaves and they came together and they bought within each other, and now look at them. Media, banking, entertainment — they run sh*t. We can run sh*t, but we killing each other. All you young n****s, stop killing each other.”

Later in the interview, he expanded: “If we love us and did what the Jews did — see how the Jews control banking, media, entertainment; they’re in Beverly Hills, Miami — we could do the same thing, but the problem with us is we’re killing each other.” The comments echo those of Kanye West, who ranted about Jared Kushner during his controversial appearance on the show back in 2022. At the time, Ye argued that ""Kushner is an example of how the Jewish people have their hand on every single business that controls the world."" Accusing Jews of controlling ""banking, media, entertainment"" and more is a common antisemitic troupe, according to the Anti-Defamation League, as well as many other organizations.
Benzino Speaks With ""Drink Champs""
In addition to his antisemitic comments, he also attempted to put his feud with Eminem to rest. Breaking into tears, he explained how it's affected his relationship with his daughter and her career in the entertainment industry. Benzino also dissed Shannon Sharpe while responding to fans' jokes about his nose. Check out his full appearance on Drink Champs above.

Fellow artists Playboi Carti and Rich The Kid - with whom Kanye has worked for his vile new album Vultures 1 - joined the couple in the stands for the last-16 first-leg clash.
Bianca opted for a black coat to match her slicked black hair.
However, supporters were distracted by Kanye's bizarre outfit as he wore a black jacket with the hood up, black gloves and a black mask covering his whole face.
And that prompted a mixture of witty comments on social media.
Specsavers said: ""Can he see?""
Another added: ""Looks like he'll miss most of the match.""
A third replied: ""How does he breathe or watch the game?""
A fourth wrote: ""I doubt he’ll catch very much of the match to be honest.""

West has formed an unusual bond with Inter Milan.
He brought a group of the club's Ultras into a studio as they were recorded to provide a raucous backing atmosphere for some tracks on his new album including Carnival.
And the passionate supporters were even added to the credits for the album.
Kanye is putting on a listening party for the latest launch in Milan on Thursday before a similar event in Bologna at the weekend.
But before that, he made the most of his visit to the city to watch Inter take on Atletico Madrid.
West may well have seen Lautauro Martinez fluff his lines with a glorious chance before half-time.

Kanye West und Bianca Censori zeigen sich ungewohnt schlicht,"So sieht man sie nicht oft! Seit Dezember 2022 sind Kanye West (46) und Bianca Censori offiziell Mann und Frau. Seither polarisiert ihre Beziehung immer wieder. Warum? Der US-amerikanische Rapper präsentiert seine Frau auf Social Media regelmäßig in sehr freizügigen Outfits. Zur Sorge der Fans sieht man das Model auch unterwegs stets sehr knapp bekleidet. In Florenz überraschen Kanye und Bianca jetzt jedoch im unauffälligen Look!
Die von Page Six veröffentlichten Schnappschüsse zeigen das berühmte Ehepaar beim Valentinstagsdate in Florenz. Lächelnd spazieren sie durch die italienische Stadt. Besonders fällt auf: Bianca zeigt diese Mal gar keine Haut. Im Gegenteil, sie trägt einen schwarzen übergroßen Mantel, der ihr bis zu den Fußspitzen reicht. Dazu kombiniert sie zusätzlich eine schwarze Kapuze, die ihren Kopf bedeckt. Auch Kanye scheint sich seiner Frau angepasst zu haben. Der Sänger trägt ebenfalls von Kopf bis Fuß schwarze Kleidung. In dunkler Windjacke und entspannter Hose sieht er ungewohnt normal aus.
Ob er sich die Kritik seiner Fans zu Herzen genommen hat? Wahrscheinlich eher nicht. In einem Video-Statement auf Instagram machte der Ex-Mann von Kim Kardashian (43) vor wenigen Tagen deutlich: ""Mir ist egal, was ihr sagt! Ich werde meine Frau so oft posten, wie ich will!""

Kanye West celebrates as daughter North breaks Billboard record,"North West wrote and rapped in ‘Vultures’ soundtrack ‘Talking’
Kanye West is a proud father.
The legendary rapper took to his Instagram Wednesday to celebrate his daughter North breaking the record for being the youngest artist ever to top the Billboard 100 Charts.
The doting father reposted a black-and-white photo of North – baring a striking resemblance to her iconic father – with the text “North West earns her first-ever entry to the Hot 100 this week with TALKING”
“She becomes one of the youngest artists to ever chart, at age 10,” the post further revealed.
North – who Kanye shares with his ex-wife Kim Kardashian – was featured on Kanye’s new album collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign entitled Vultures.
The young star famously penned and rapped the words, “It’s your bestie/ Miss, miss Westie/ Don’t trynna test me/ It’s gonna get messy/ Just, just bless me/ Bless me.”

Taylor Swift’s no big reaction to Kanye West’s name-drops in Carnival song,"Taylor Swift's response to Kanye West's new name-drop in Carnival track
Taylor Swift has recently shared no reaction to Kanye West’s name-dropped in his new song, Carnival.
A source told US Weekly, “Taylor has so much on her plate and isn’t concerned with what Kanye is or isn’t doing.”
“She has no plans on responding publicly or privately,” remarked an insider.
US reported that Kanye and Taylor’s rivalry started in 2009 when the former jumped on stage at the MTV VMA while Taylor was delivering her acceptance speech.
He interrupted the songstress, and added, Beyoncé had one of the “best music videos of all time for Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)”
Later, in 2016, Kanye alleged Taylor allowed him to name-check her in his track Famous.
Taylor, on the other hand, clarified she never approved of the line, “I made that bitch famous”.
Another insider spilled to the outlet, “From Taylor’s point of view, this beef is one-sided.”
“Kanye is trying to get back in the spotlight and an easy way to do that is through Taylor, who has completely moved on,” added the source.
Meanwhile, Kanye’s song Carnival, which was release on February 17, came days after speculations arose that Taylor had kicked Kanye out of Super Bowl LVIII for purchasing tickets in front of her private suite.",2024-02-20T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

Bianca Censori appeared extremely uncomfortable during her recent outing with her husband Kanye West.
For the unversed, the couple spotted the UEFA Champions League match between Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.
However, the rapper grabbed all the attention as he completely covered his face with a bizarre face mask, leaving Bianca uncomfortable.
Speaking of the pair's gestures, Judi James, a known body language expert told The Mirror, ""Kanye appears to be keen to suffer for his art here in the exact opposite way to his wife Bianca.""
She added, ""While Bianca’s nearly-nude outings have previously made her the centre of attention, Kanye's version of Harry Potter's invisibility cape here would turn the focus on himself for once while his wife is fully covered up.""
The expert believes that the 'extreme masking' was also making the rapper 'uncomfortable.'
""It's debatable whether his eye coverings mean he can see his beautiful wife at all but if he can he might like to pay attention to her slightly dour facial expression that hints this is not a totally fun, carefree experience for her,"" Judi shared.
She further explained, ""Her eyes are looking down as they walk together, suggesting the line 'Have you met my husband?' is not at the ready and that she might prefer to not see the reactions of people around them.""",2024-02-20T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

This is certainly a good time to be close to Ye given everything he has going on. He just dropped Vultures 1 and he has plans to come through with two more volumes. Furthermore, he has been increasing his Yeezy production as he has some new shoes and clothes out.
One of the many garments that he has been pushing as of late is a white tank top that says WET on the front. In fact, this is a tank top that Bianca has been wearing a whole lot. At this point, it seems like the flagship garment that Ye is trying to push for his women consumers. In addition to Censori, it seems like India Love is now an official face of the tank top. Below, you can see some snaps where she is wearing the piece with some booty shorts. It shows off all of her curves, which will likely lead to more units being sold.

"Lil Tjay Thinks Him & Kanye West Should Collab On ""VULTURES,"" Talks Avoiding Cancel Culture","""You only canceled if you cancel yourself if you allow them to cancel you."" Those were the words of New York rapper and singer Lil Tjay. According to AllHipHop, TMZ caught him at the airport to talk about Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's controversial album VULTURES 1. Outside of the quality of the music and its rollout, the main reason why this LP is receiving backlash is because of its creator. It makes sense, especially because of Ye's comments about antisemitism and his questionable actions online with his wife Bianca Censori. Music listeners have been at war over whether this album is good or not. But, Lil Tjay sees VULTURES as a huge success.
Tjay went on to talk about how cancel culture is more so about what each individual feels. ""I feel like n****s can't cancel me, n****s can't cancel nobody—all they can do is block you out of they world, and they world is limited to what they do."" That ability to block out the noise allowed Kanye and Ty to nonchalantly go number one. On top of that, they did it without a major label as well, being exclusively released through YZY.

That is another reason why Lil Tjay feels VULTURES did so well. Even with the lack of label support, the fans did enough to run up the streams and sales. Tjay said, ""I think that label s*** help. I think if he had some support he probably would’ve did triple the numbers."" All that respect for Ye even led him to end the interview with a request to be added to VULTURES. ""So Kanye, put me on that s*** though."" he certainly put the message out a huge platform, so there is good chance this could happen.
What are your thoughts on Lil Tjay's message to Kanye West, asking to be on VULTURES? Do you think they would sound good on a track together, why or why not?

Kanye West and wife Bianca Censori put on a much more low-key display while walking around Florence, Italy, this week.
The “Stronger” rapper and the Yeezy architect were photographed smiling and chatting with each other while getting out of a car and walking around the Italian art hub on Monday.
Unlike many of their past outings, Censori, 29, was fully clothed and covered up in a black hoodie over her head with an oversized black leather trench coat.

West, 46, also opted for a more conservative look in a dark windbreaker with his hoodie up, complete with matching slacks.
The duo are reportedly visiting the city to develop their new line of clothing, but they have yet to announce an official collaboration.
Just last week, they were also photographed enjoying a Valentine’s Day dinner together.

Florence seems to hold a special place in both of their hearts, as they were also photographed spending a significant amount of time there last summer.
While the Grammy winner has been spotted out and about several times with his wife ever since they tied the knot in December 2022, he and Censori have both kept fairly quiet about their relationship.

However, West recently emphasized that he’s “happy” with Censori while also defending sharing risqué photos of her.
“‘Cause she makes me happy. That’s why y’all happy with the music because I’m happy. You understand?” West said in a since-deleted Instagram selfie video last week.

West told the internet trolls to “go f–k yourself” if they don’t like what he’s posting and to “leave me — leave the king — the f–k alone.”
“I don’t care bro. I’m going to post my wife as much as I want. Go post your wife on your f–king Instagram,” he shared.

The “Gold Digger” rapper has turned heads several times over the last few years for sharing steamy photos of his wife –– including ones of her wearing a skimpy bikini top, tiny thong and partially see-through “WET” tank top.
Censori has also worn many of these risquè outfits in public, in addition to more looks consisting of sheer tights, latex and even transparent raincoats.
Most recently, Censori’s behind was put on full display with just a thin black sheer square of fabric covering part of her crevice on the cover of West’s “Vultures 1” album, a collaboration project with Ty Dolla Sign’s (collectively known as ¥$).",2024-02-20T15:44:56Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
A música não mente: o regresso de Kanye West em Vultures 1,"Depois do delírio evangelizador, eis Kanye West, o ímpio. Quando a cabeça não tem juízo, a música é que paga – o que não é necessariamente mau.
Num artigo recente de uma publicação americana, a parangona rezava: “É mais difícil desistir de Kanye West do que parece”. A narrativa faz-se sozinha: o objectivo, finalmente assumido, é desistir (outros dirão “cancelar”), independentemente daquilo que o visado faça, no caso – porque convém lembrar que é disso que se está a falar, e não de um concurso de beleza moral –, música. O artista mais cegamente idolatrado das últimas duas décadas (The College Dropout faz precisamente 20 anos) é hoje um pária ostracizado de quem o ouvinte deve tentar, contranatura, não gostar.",2024-02-20T13:55:48Z,https://www.publico.pt,PÚBLICO
Jornal de Brasília,"Do k-pop do Stray Kidz ao rap de Kanye West, os lançamentos dos últimos meses no mundo da música deixam claro: o funk brasileiro é uma influência para músicos do mundo todo
LUIZA MISSI
SÃO PAULO, SP (UOL/FOLHAPRESS) –
Do k-pop do Stray Kidz ao rap de Kanye West, os lançamentos dos últimos meses no mundo da música deixam claro: o funk brasileiro é uma influência para músicos do mundo todo. Mas será que essa influência se traduz em prestígio -e dinheiro- para os brasileiros?
Para o DJ Mu540, um dos maiores produtores do funk hoje, a homenagem só funciona com os devidos créditos. “Me preocupa um pouco que [os gringos] estão conhecendo o funk errado, sabe? Não estão conhecendo pela gente, estão conhecendo de um conceito que eles criaram sobre isso, porque estourou muito lá”.
O DJ, que fez uma turnê pela Europa no ano passado, viu essa influência de perto: “Quando fui lá fora,,percebi que estava todo mundo querendo um pedacinho do funk. Todo mundo querendo ser funkeiro um pouquinho. Enxerguei um amor nisso, e enxerguei também uma visão meio oportunista. Não é à toa que fizeram o ‘phonk’, tá ligado? Nada mais é do que um beat imitando bruxaria, não é nada novo. São gringos agora fazendo funk”.
Nota da edição: o “phonk” produzido por estrangeiros viralizou no TikTok e no YouTube nos últimos anos em vídeos de animes e games, e chama atenção pela semelhança com subgêneros do funk paulista, como mandelão, bruxaria e automotivo.
A preocupação dele é que o estilo inspirado no Brasil vire referência para os próprios brasileiros. “A gente é muito criativo em criar ritmos, mesmo emulando lá de fora. O funk é isso. Agora, corta para 2024, a gente se espelhando no estilo que foi emulado da gente mesmo. Isso é muito louco, eu não sei o que vai acontecer daqui para frente”.
“A gente não tem muita autoestima. A gente vai replicando de fora, então o que tá acontecendo? Olha que fita: o Brasil foi inspiração para esse estilo ‘phonk’, e agora que esse estilo está estourado, o brasileiro fica se espelhando no estilo emulado de nós mesmos. Que p* é essa?”, disse o DJ Mu540
CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE
Há quem faça questão de separar o funk brasileiro da pegada eletrônica do phonk. Mu540 discorda: “Para mim, o funk do Brasil sempre foi eletrônico, porque ele foi feito atrás de um PC. A gente gerou ele por intermédio de ‘zeros’ e ‘uns’. Foi convertido ali numa placa de som, numa interface de áudio que o sinal analógico foi para digital e vice-versa. Funk é música eletrônica por isso, cientificamente falando”.
Para ele, a separação dos dois gêneros é uma forma de minimizar o funk. “Interessa para quem quer dar uma imagem nossa como se a gente não tivesse informação para ter a capacidade de fazer isso. A indústria entende a música eletrônica como aquilo: tech, house, garbage. E os clubs de música eletrônica dão mais dinheiro para isso.
Você nunca vai ver um DJ Ramon Sucesso na Laroc [casa de música eletrônica em Vinhedo, na Grande São Paulo], sabe? Você nunca vai ver o DJ Arana na Laroc, pelo menos por enquanto. O funk não entra lá”.
Apesar do preconceito, interessa ao funk entrar nesses espaços. “A gente tem que entrar em qualquer espaço. Hoje mesmo, eu fiz um house misturado com funk. Totalmente homogêneo, muito bom. Se eu não tivesse essa brisa, eu não ia tentar entrar nesse espaço e não ia tentar pegar esse cachê. Quero esse cachê da Laroc. Quero o cachê da GreenValley [club de eletrônica em Balneário Camboriú], eu quero o cachê da Tomorrowland, eu quero o cachê da Pacha Ibiza, de todas as ‘Pacha’ que tem”.",2024-02-20T04:39:00Z,https://jornaldebrasilia.com.br,Jornal de Brasília
"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign React Meekly To ""Vultures"" Going Number One","Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's collaborative album Vultures just went number one on the Billboard charts despite a lot of release issues plaguing its rollout, plus all the antisemitic bigotry associated with it. All that aside, it seems like the album really connected with fans, and both artists seemingly reacted to this news. Of course, they've both boasted about it going number one in a lot fo countries before this Billboard confirmation. ""It’s a beautiful time,"" Ye stated to Complex, whereas Ty posted a video of himself saying, ""Huh? Hm? S**t..."" to the haters while holding up one index finger.
Vultures sold around 148,000 units in its first week, and this marks Ty Dolla Sign's first-ever number one album. On the other hand, this is Kanye West's eleventh number one album, and he technically hasn't broken this consecutive streak of chart-toppers if you don't count his G.O.O.D. Music compilation from 2012 or KIDS SEE GHOSTS with Kid Cudi. Even though they're both huge artists, they should be grateful for having all this work out in their favor, as they are extremely lucky. Still, when you have as much money and infamy as they do, sample clearance issues become much easier to handle.

Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign's Vultures 1 Goes No. 1: The Latter Reacts
Another big problem with Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign's first collab's release was its distribution method, as original distributor FUGA took it off streaming services temporarily. ""On Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement,” a statement from the company read. “Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems."" This resolved itself promptly, though.
Meanwhile, the duo is now looking forward to some European listening events, kicking off in Italy and (at press time) wrapping up in Paris. Perhaps this will be the opportunity they have to celebrate this number one and to celebrate getting a new distributor for it. What do you think about Vultures 1 and how the next installments will shape up? Let us know in the comments and come back to HNHH for the latest on Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign.

Kanye West Roasted For Wearing Jeans With No Underwear In Resurfaced Video,"Kanye West is someone who has always tried to push boundaries as it pertains to the fashion world. Overall, he has come through with a lot of bizarre outfits during his life. This has been especially true in the world of sneakers. Although he has had a lot of success selling shoes, there is no doubt that a lot of his sneakers have been roasted by fans. These days, however, it is his wife Bianca Censori who takes most of the heat. This is because Ye has her wearing some truly bizarre and revealing outfits that are not appropriate for polite society.
Regardless, there are still times when Ye has us surprised with whatever he has on. A good example of this is found in the video below. This resurfaced clip, shared by DJ Kam Bennett, showcases Ye wearing a pair of jeans. Typically, jeans are nothing new for Ye. However, it was high he styled them this time around that had fans raising their eyebrows. As you can see at the end of the clip, the rapper is not wearing any underwear. While some do this with sweatpants, very few do it with some as uncomfortable as jeans.

Netizens Believes Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were The 'Real Deal' with These Iconic Old Pictures,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s relationship might’ve unraveled into non-existence as of last year. But, they did celebrate 7 glorious years of marriage and welcomed four children in their time together. Despite the bitter exchanges in the recent past, they did love each other beyond measure at one point of time. After their separation, West even attempted to win Kardashian back, but his efforts proved futile. As time moved on, so did they: West married Bianca Censori, and Kardashian is now rumored to be dating Odell Beckham Jr. However, some admirers couldn’t help but feel nostalgic about what the former flames shared in the past; The fandom was here for it!

An account on Instagram recounted a few iconic pictures of West and Kardashian from when they were still lovers. What’s interesting is that the user shared a series of images featuring the couple on account of Valentine's Day. The carousel of memories saw West and Kardashian in different avatars. The first one featured the blushing duo engaged in a hearty conversation.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by velvey 🦥 (@velvetcoke)
Another saw them twinning in ‘Hello Kitty’ ensembles followed by Kardashian with cotton candy pink hair almost kissing West. Other pictures included Kardashian happily curled up into a ball next to her passed-out ex-husband. Also in the frame was a steamy picture of the two caught in an NSFW pose. There was also a heartwarming snippet of West giving his beloved ex-wife a piggyback ride.
Naturally, many fans of the ex-couple fondly looked through the pictures and began expressing their adoration in the comment section. The first one reminisced, “Iconic until it wasn’t.” A second one thought back to the once-magical relationship the former couple shared and seemed to empathize with Kardashian. The fan said, “They were the real deal. It makes me feel so sad to think about how much he’s lost, and how distressing it must have been for her to witness him self-destruct.”

A third one echoed the thoughts of the previous comment offering wishful thinking about the romance they once had. The fan added, “I wish it worked out for them. It seems like they really did love each other.” Furthermore, the person claimed that although they weren’t a particular fan of either of them, “something about their relationship seemed like the only real thing she’s done.” Lastly, the commenter said, “Besides being a mom, I can tell she loves that truly.”
A fourth painfully noted, “They look so happy in these.” A fifth one hoped, “I really wish they could’ve worked out their marriage, they looked so happy. And I believe they truly loved each other.” A final one highlights the adorable matching outfits mentioned earlier with Kardashian’s top reading: ‘Hello Kimmy’ and his reading: ‘Hello Kanye.”

The fan said, “The Hello Kitty looks are actually so cute. Idk I think they were twin flames.” West and Kardashian might be on cordial terms with each other as they navigate their journey of co-parenting. But, their love story will live on in the hearts of many fans who’ve been a minute part of their lives from afar.",2024-02-19T11:10:25Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Kanye West allo stadio per Inter-Atletico: incasso da 9 milioni di euro,"Il rapper di Chicago in due canzoni del suo ultimo album ha inserito i cori della Curva Nord ed è diventato... tifoso nerazzurro. San Siro sarà tutto esaurito, con oltre 3.000 supporter spagnoli nel solo settore ospiti. Cancelli aperti alle 19. Presenti oltre 600 operatori dell'informazione e 36 tv broadcaster in arrivo da tutto il mondo
Andrea Ramazzotti
In tribuna autorità per Inter-Atletico Madrid ci sarà anche Kanye West, il rapper e produttore musicale di Chicago che sabato sarà in concerto a Bologna. L'artista nel suo ultimo album ""Vultures 1"", realizzato insieme a Ty Dolla Sign, ha inserito in due brani (""Stars"" e ""Carnival"") i cori appositamente cantati da duecento tifosi della Curva Nord nerazzurra. E siccome si trova in Italia (Paese dove tra l'altro si è sposato nel maggio 2014), non ha perso l'occasione per essere presente alla gara di cartello di quella che ormai è diventata la sua squadra del cuore. Anche se il vero amante di calcio in famiglia è il figlio (suo e dell'ormai ex moglie-modella, Kim Kardashian), Saint, pure Kanye West si sta appassionando al mondo del pallone e non è voluto mancare a Inter-Atletico.
PALLONE E LEGENDS NERAZZURRE — Il pallone utilizzato sarà quello che ha debuttato, la scorsa settimana, in questa fase a eliminazione diretta della Champions e che accompagnerà le squadre fino alla finale dell'1 giugno a Londra: realizzato dall'Adidas, ha una grafica vibrante che raffigura due leoni ruggenti che combattono tra le stelle. Tra i grandi interisti del passato in tribuna ci saranno Galante, Palacio, Cruz, Pandev e Berti. Prima dell'inizio del match si esibirà il turco Mahmut Orhan, deejay in ascesa nel mondo della musica elettronica e che ad aprile debutterà al Coachella, uno dei festival di musica più importanti al mondo.
20 TELECAMERE E DRONE — Il match sarà prodotto da Mediaset e le telecamere, tutte in ultra HD, sul campo saranno 20. Ci sarà un drone per le riprese dall'alto, anche dall'esterno di San Siro: seguirà l'avvicinamento dei pullman e prima del fischio d'inizio regalerà riprese suggestive. I broadcaster presenti al Meazza saranno 36 e arriveranno da tutto il mondo.

"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign's ""Vultures 1"" First Week Sales Revealed","Vultures 1 will debut atop the Billboard Album 200, giving Kanye West his 11th No. 1 album. Per Luminate, the long-awaited album sold 148,000 copies in its first week. The project beat out Usher, who debuted at No. 2, his highest in a decade, with Coming Home. The album was released on February 11, just hours before Usher headlined the Super Bowl halftime show. The full album chart will have a delayed release due to President's Day.
The album is stacked with features. The first feature of Vultures 1 is India Love on ""Keys To My Life"". Two songs later, Kanye is joined by his daughter North West for ""Talking/Once Again"". That is followed by an appearance from Freddie Gibbs on ""Back To Me"". Tracks 7 and 8 are another pair of back-to-back features, with Nipsey Hussle & YG appearing on ""Do It"" and Quavo featuring on ""Paperwork"". The final four features can be found between tracks 10 and 13. There are two appearances by Playboi Carti - ""Fuk Sum"" (also featuring Travis Scott) and ""Carnival"" (also featuring Rich The Kid). Meanwhile, Chris Brown adds his vocals to ""Beg Forgiveness"". Finally, there is the album's namesake, which features Lil Durk & Bump J.

Kanye West Debuts Cover Art For ""Carnival""
Meanwhile, Kanye has unveiled the intense cover art for ""Carnival"", one of the standout tracks from the recently released Vultures 1. Designed by noted Canadian artist Jon Rafman, the cover art for ""Carnival"" depicts a close-up of a screaming and bloodied skinhead. Rafman also created the AI-generated music video for ""Vultures (Havoc Version)"" which was released alongside the album.
""Carnival"" features Playboi Carti and Rich the Kid. As mentioned, it is widely considered one of the best tracks on Vultures 1. Many people have already called it the best song of 2024. However, the song proved controversial even before it was released. A version heard at a listening party in Chicago earned the ire of Ozzy Osbourne due to an uncleared sample of Black Sabbath. A later version at a Long Island listening party used a sample of Kanye's ""Hell of a life"", which interpolates the same Black Sabbath song.

Ozzy Osbourne Was Not Happy About Kanye West Sampling Him. What Experts Are Saying About Copyright Law In This Case,"Kanye West has been the subject of a lot of controversy over the years, most notably of late for antisemitism that has reportedly cost him over a billion dollars in brand partnerships after Adidas and others cut ties . Now his troubles continue after he released the album Vultures 1 with Ty Dolla Sign. Ozzy Osbourne spoke out after one of Ye’s songs reportedly sampled part of a Black Sabbath live performance from 1983 despite being denied permission from the artist, and now legal experts are weighing in on if the Prince of Darkness is protected by copyright law.
What’s The Issue Between Kanye West And Ozzy Osbourne?
Kanye West’s new album Vultures 1 was already raising eyebrows before its release, after a video circulated showing the rapper, Chris Brown and others laughing at antisemitic lyrics in the title track “Vultures.” The song lyrics aren’t the only controversial aspect, though, as Ozzy Osbourne took to X (Twitter) to clarify that the portion of “Iron Man” in West and Ty Dolla Sign’s “Carnival” was used without permission, writing:
KANYE WEST ASKED PERMISSION TO SAMPLE A SECTION OF A 1983 LIVE PERFORMANCE OF ‘IRON MAN’ FROM THE US FESTIVAL WITHOUT VOCALS & WAS REFUSED PERMISSION BECAUSE HE IS AN ANTISEMITE AND HAS CAUSED UNTOLD HEARTACHE TO MANY. HE WENT AHEAD AND USED THE SAMPLE ANYWAY AT HIS ALBUM LISTENING PARTY LAST NIGHT. I WANT NO ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN!
Ozzy Osbourne’s wife Sharon, who was raised Jewish, further explained why they denied Kanye West’s request, saying they “don’t want to be associated with a hater. To spread hate the way he does, it shouldn’t be allowed.”
Donna Summer’s estate had also accused Kanye West of copyright infringement for reportedly sampling “I Feel Love” on the track “Good (Don’t Die).” As of this writing, the track in question has been removed from Spotify, Apple Music and other music streamers. As for “Carnival,” Ye reportedly used a previously sampled portion of “Iron Man” that he’d cleared for the 2010 song “Hell of a Life” in the version of the Vultures 1 song that is available.
Is Kanye West In Violation Of Copyright Law?
There are reportedly different avenues artists can take or arguments to be made for using other musical works in new songs, but entertainment attorney Donald M. Woodard didn’t seem to think any of the scenarios would hold up in court if Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne choose to pursue legal action against Kanye West. Woodward told Business Insider that in his eyes Ye is guilty of copyright infringement, saying:
This one, from everything I've seen, is clear cut, and Kanye's response also suggests that it was clear he modified the work. He didn't dispute it.
Business litigator Robert Freund agreed, saying that neither of the two options that would allow Kanye West to use music without getting the copyrighted material released — fair use and de minimis use — applies to the situation with Black Sabbath’s famous song. Freund said he doesn’t think a court would favor a “fair use” argument in this case, and as for “de minimis,” he said:
A de minimis argument is not going to be available to Kanye West if this situation were litigated. Because I listened to the sample that he took, and the whole point of him sampling it is because everyone recognizes that's the 'Iron Man' riff; it's like one of the most famous guitar riffs in rock history. That's off the table.",2024-02-18T21:30:48Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign’s ‘Vultures 1’ Debuts Atop Billboard 200,"Ye (formerly known as Kanye West) and Ty Dolla $ign’s joint project Vultures 1 debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Feb. 24), giving Ye his 11th leader and Ty his first. The set earned 148,000 equivalent album units in the U.S. in the week ending Feb. 15, according to Luminate, following its release on Feb. 10.
Plus, Usher scores his highest charting album on the Billboard 200 in over a decade, as his latest studio release Coming Home bows at No. 2 with 91,000 units earned.
Trending on Billboard
The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Feb. 24, 2024-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Feb. 21, one day later than usual, owed to the Presidents’ Day holiday in the U.S. on Feb. 19. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.
Of Vultures 1’s 148,000 units earned in the tracking week ending Feb. 15, SEA units comprise 129,000 (equaling 167.78 million on-demand official streams of the set’s songs), album sales comprise 18,000 and TEA units comprise 1,000.
Vultures 1 was only initially available via streaming services and as a digital download album for purchase. The original 16-track set was available through all major streamers, and sold through leading digital retailers, as well as Ye’s own official webstore. Physical versions of the album on CD and vinyl are expected to be released at a later date, and Ye’s store is accepting pre-orders for both presently. The set’s first-week sales were boosted by aggressive sale pricing.
The album boasts appearances from collaborators Travis Scott, Playboi Carti and Chris Brown, though none are given billed artist credit on the tracklist. Ye’s 10-year-old daughter North also contributes vocals to the set’s “Talking.”
Vultures 1 is the first studio album for both Ye and Ty released outside of the major label system, and arrived on Feb. 10 via Ye’s own label YZY after a number of delays (it was originally slated for release last October). Vultures 1 is Ye’s first album since his string of hate speech and antisemitic remarks, which resulted in companies like Adidas and Def Jam Recordings distancing themselves from Ye. (Def Jam released all of Ye’s previous studio albums, including his last widely released album, 2021’s Donda.)
Vultures 1 was issued on Feb. 10 and had a bumpy first-week in the marketplace. Its initial independent distributor, FUGA, took down the project on Feb. 15. The set then found a home with another indie, Label Engine (part of Create Music Group), that same day.
Meanwhile, one of tracks initially included on the Vultures 1 — “Good (Don’t Die)” — was removed from the streaming edition of the album on Feb. 14 on Spotify, and then other streamers and digital retailers on Feb. 15. The song appears to interpolate elements of Donna Summer’s 1977 single “I Feel Love,” which Summer’s estate claimed West used without permission and alleged “copyright infringement.” On Feb. 15, with “Good” removed from the album’s tracklist, the album was no longer purchasable in digital retailers like the iTunes Store and Amazon. (It was, however, still available to buy, with “Good” intact, through Ye’s official webstore.)
Ye ties Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand with 11 No. 1s each. Ahead of them are only The Beatles (a record 19 No. 1s), Jay-Z (14), Drake and Taylor Swift (each with 13). Vultures 1 is Ye’s 11th consecutive charting album to debut at No. 1, the most of any artist. (Overall, Jay-Z has the most debuts at No. 1, with 14, but they were not consecutive.)
For Ty, Vultures 1 brings him his first leader and second top 10-charting effort. He’s logged a total of eight entries on the list, going as high as No. 4 in 2020 with Featuring Ty Dolla $ign.
Vultures 1 was preceded by the single “Vultures,” featuring Bump J, which reached No. 38 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in December.
At No. 2 on the Billboard 200, Usher achieves his highest-charting album in over a decade, as his new studio set Coming Home starts in the runner-up slot. The album was released on Feb. 9 and earned 91,000 equivalent album units in the U.S. in the week ending Feb. 15. Of that sum, album sales comprise 53,000, SEA units comprise 34,500 (equaling 45.82 million official on-demand streams of the set’s songs) and TEA units comprise 3,500.
Coming Home’s release date was announced last September, hot on the heels of news that Usher would headline the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show on Feb. 11.
The 2024 Super Bowlitself was the most-watched broadcast in American TV history, with 123.4 million viewers across CBS and the game’s simulcasts across Nickelodeon, Univision, Paramount+ and other digital platforms. Usher didn’t perform any material from the new album during the halftime show, focusing instead on familiar favorites from the past, such as “My Boo” (with Alicia Keys), “U Got It Bad” (with H.E.R.) “OMG” (with will.i.am) and the show-closing “Yeah!” (with Lil Jon and Ludacris).
Coming Home marks Usher’s ninth top 10-charting album on the Billboard 200 and his highest-ranking set since Looking 4 Myself debuted at No. 1 in June of 2012. He then charted with Hard II Love (No. 5 in 2016) and the collaborative set A with Zaytoven (No. 31 in 2018).
Coming Home is Usher’s first independently distributed album after a career with majors BMG and Sony (through the labels LaFace, Arista and RCA). The new project was released via mega (Usher’s own company in partnership with L.A. Reid) and Gamma (helmed by Larry Jackson), and distributed by Vydia (part of the Gamma organization).
Coming Home was available to purchase in its first week as a standard digital download, a standard CD, five different vinyl variants, two deluxe boxed sets and a deluxe digital album with a bonus track and alternative cover art. The latter was promoted as a SKIMS exclusive (alongside Usher’s new starring role in a SKIMS campaign) and sold for a limited time via SKIMS’ official store and Usher’s own webstore. Like Vultures 1, the Coming Home digital album was deeply discounted during its first week.
Coming Home was preceded by the single “Good Good,” with Summer Walker and 21 Savage. The track peaked at No. 25 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 in November, marking Usher’s first top 40 since 2017, and highest-charting track since 2015, when “I Don’t Mind,” featuring Juicy J, reached No. 11.
Noah Kahan’s Stick Season climbs 5-3 on the Billboard 200, matching its peak rank, spurred by the release of its new deluxe edition. Stick Season surges with 85,000 equivalent album units earned (up 74% — its best week yet by units earned), following the bow of a deluxe edition of the album on Feb. 9 with nine additional tracks. That deluxe iteration is dubbed Stick Season (Forever) and added collaborations with Post Malone, Kacey Musgraves and others. The original Stick Season album debuted in 2022 with 14 tracks, was deluxed last June with an additional seven tracks (which prompted its jump from No. 100 to No. 3), and then deluxed again on Feb. 9 with nine more tracks. All versions of the album are combined for tracking and charting purposes.
The rest of the top 10 on the new Billboard 200 is comprised of former No. 1s: Morgan Wallen’s One Thing at a Time falls 2-4 (64,000 equivalent album units earned; down 1%); SZA’s SOS dips 3-5 (51,000; down 4%); Taylor Swift’s 1989 (Taylor’s Version) rises 8-6 (50,000; up 3%); Swift’s Lover moves 9-7 (48,000; up 7%); Swift’s Midnights falls 5-8 (46,000; down 9%); Toby Keith’s 35 Biggest Hits tumbles 1-9 (46,000; down 31%); and Drake’s For All the Dogs descends 6-10 (45,000; down 8%).

"Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign Announce 'Vultures 1' Paris Listening Event","Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign are bringing Vultures 1 to Paris.
On Saturday (Feb. 18), Ye and Ty announced through social media that they will present their new joint album to fans at Paris’ Accor Arena on Sunday, Feb. 25.
The duo’s newly announced “listening experience” follows previously announced events scheduled in Italy. Earlier in the week, West and Dolla $ign revealed they would play Vultures 1 for concert-goers at the Milan Forum (Feb. 22) and Bologna Unipol Arena (Feb. 24).
West and Ty delivered their anticipated Vultures 1 album last weekend and the project is vying for the No. 1 slot on the Billboard 200 albums chart, which would mark Ye’s 11th chart-topper. The set was originally supposed to debut on Feb. 9 after a Chicago listening event, but ultimately trickled out (with a false start or two) on streaming services over Feb. 10.

The 16-track Vultures 1 features appearances from big-name collaborators like Travis Scott, Playboi Carti and Chris Brown (though none are actually credited on the feature-less tracklist), as well as a guest vocal from Ye’s 10-year-old daughter North on “Talking.”
Vultures 1 marks the first project for West since his string of hate speech and antisemitic remarks, which resulted in companies such as Adidas and Def Jam distancing themselves from the 46-year-old rapper. It’s also his first album since the release of 2021’s Donda, which won a pair of Grammys the following year, most notably best rap song for “Jail.” As for Ye and Ty, their collaborations date back to Ty’s “Ego Death” (2020), Ye’s “Everything We Need” (2019), “Real Friends” (2016), and “Only One” (2014).
In addition to Ye and Ty’s listening event at Chicago’s United Center on Feb. 8, the pair hosted a similar experience at New York’s UBS Arena on Feb. 9. The duo is also scheduled to headline Rolling Loud California on March 14.

"Kanye West Remixes Donald Trump Sneaker Reveal With ""CARNIVAL""","If you didn't already hear, Donald Trump bizarrely unveiled his new sneaker line at Sneaker Con in Philly on Saturday (February 17). Apparently the 1,000 available pairs already sold out at about $400 each, and the ""NEVER SURRENDER HIGH-TOP"" is a pretty ugly golden shoe with a U.S. flag plastered onto it. But that's not what caught a lot of hip-hop heads' attention about these shoes. Instead, it has to do with one of the disgraced former president's strongest allies, and former competitor, within pop culture: Kanye West. According to The Neighborhood Talk, he posted a clip of Trump's sneaker reveal on his Instagram Story with the caption: ""This made me smile.""
Furthermore, since this clip is not on Ye's IG page at press time, we can't confirm for sure whether he really posted this or this is just an edit. Regardless, it was particularly notable because the video included a snippet of Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, Rich The Kid, and Playboi Carti's song ""CARNIVAL"" instead of the actual music Donald Trump played during this reveal. It would've still made sense if he played the track, though. After all, what better way to soundtrack a bigot than with another?

Kanye West Seemingly Reposts Trump's Sneaker Reveal
All that aside, the Chicago artist did legitimately establish his support of Donald Trump for the 2024 election recently. This is after his own presidential campaign for this season failed to materialize, and following an unsuccessful run back in 2020. Kanye West doesn't seem to be harping on this as much as he was a couple of years ago, which is at least an improvement. However, with all the controversies involved with them right now, we can't say that this is a net positive reunion for anyone.
Meanwhile, with more listening events on the horizon for the 46-year-old, we'll see what else is in his antics bag. As for No. 45... we can't wait to laugh at how he will style his sneakers with a regular suit. Should make for a nice meme, at least. Jokes aside, for more news and the latest updates on Kanye West, log back into HNHH.

"Kanye West Announces ""Vultures"" Listening Party In Paris","Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign will be repping their new collab album Vultures for the rest of the year, it seems. Moreover, the former just announced another listening party -– sorry, ""listening experience"" -– for the project or its supposed sequels, this time in Paris' Accor Arena next Sunday (February 25). Earlier this week, the duo announced two other listening events in Italy for Vultures, scheduled for February 22 in Milan and February 24 in Bologna. As such, it looks like they really want to ramp things up ahead of Vultures 2. Whether that even ends up dropping is anyone's guess, but fans are holding onto hope.
Furthermore, European fans may want to hop onto these parties if they're big Ye and Ty fans, because they don't know for sure when they'll get to listen to Vultures in its intended form. Of course, the release of this album came marred with sample clearance issues, distribution disputes, disappearances from streaming services, and a whole lot of drama. As is typical for a Kanye West rollout, it was the hottest topic for a moment, and then everything just kind of fell back into place. Unfortunately, we can't really pinpoint what there is to learn from all this.

Kanye West Announces Paris Listening Party
For folks on the other side of the Atlantic, though, they might have another chance to see Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign perform. Rolling Loud California announced that they will perform at the festival on March 14, which is days after Vultures 2 is supposed to come out. Will this sequel project actually come out, and will the duo actually show up to perform at this rap festival? Again, it's a tough call to make, and betting on the Chicago artist's word is mostly a fool's errand.
Meanwhile, the first installment's commercial performance has been unsurprisingly impressive, although Billboard doesn't seem to count it for its charts. Maybe they don't want to give Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign any more press for the antisemitic bigotry associated with the rollout. Or, some fans think, their distribution model could've played a part, but either way, fans are still bumping it. We'll see how these listening events keep the story going. For more news and the latest updates on Vultures, stick around on HNHH.

D'Innocenzo Brothers' Talk 'Dostoevskij' and Kanye West Collaboration,"Twin directors Damiano and Fabio D’Innocenzo, who are known to Berlin Film Festival audiences for stylishly gritty dramas “Boys Cry” and “Bad Tales,” are back with eclectic detective series “Dostoevskij,” premiering in the fest’s Berlinale Special section.
Set in the stark Roman hinterland, the six-episode show — produced by Sky Studios with Rome’s Paco Cinematografica — stars Filippo Timi (“Vincere,” “The Eight Mountains”) as Enzo Vitello, a policeman whose mind is warped by an incident involving his daughter Ambra. He winds up on the trail of a ruthless serial killer, nicknamed Dostoevskij because of the letters full of gruesome details that he leaves at crime scenes. Haunted by the killer’s words, the cop embarks on a dangerous solo investigation, getting closer and closer to a disturbing existential truth.
Courtesy Sky
“Dostoevskij,” which marks the D’Innocenzo brothers’ TV debut, stemmed from Sky Studios Italia chief Nils Hartmann asking them if they wanted to create a show and giving them carte blanche from a narrative standpoint.
“We just asked them what genre they wanted and they said: ‘a thriller,’” recounts Fabio, and then “in half an hour we wrote the core of ‘Dostoevskij’ on a page. Obviously, writing the screenplay was much more complicated.”
In terms of references for “Dostoevskij,” Damiano says that “we had none, which is an approach that I strongly advise to any film director who is transitioning to TV.” That said, the directors tried to divide the six-episode screenplay into three acts, just like a film.
Interestingly, Sky did not ask them for any scene breakdowns, nor did they attempt to micromanage the show’s production in any other way. “Hartmann and his team were like a good soccer coach who understands that as artists — if we can use that word — we are the types of players who need to feel at ease on the field without someone breathing down our back,” Damiano says.
As for casting, Timi playing the role of Enzo was crucial. Although they wrote the show with Timi in mind, the directors asked the actor to lose between 10 and 15 kilos because the tormented investigator “suffers from gastric disorders,” Fabio says. “We also wanted his whole body to be as craggy and bare as the landscape in which the show is set.”
“Dostoevskij” marks the D’Innocenzo brothers’ first collaboration with cinematographer Matteo Cocco, with whom the duo also recently shot the music video for “Talking/Once Again” by Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign, which features a verse from West’s 10-year-old daughter.
“It’s a very intimate video between a father and a daughter and we just wanted to leave stardom out of it,” Damiano says. “It’s really about being human.”
As for working with West, Damiano says “he is truly a great source of inspiration for us. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a person work so hard, non-stop. He never sleeps. It’s incredible. And the amount of physical strength he puts into his work is amazing.”
Shooting the music video was intense. “As you well know, [in Italy] on a 10-hour shoot you get some rest,” he adds. “But Ye didn’t seem to need it.” So they just kept going.

"""Vultures"": Μπορεί ο Kanye West να επανεφεύρει τον εαυτό του;","ΟΤΑΝ ΕΙΧΕ ΠΡΩΤΟΑΝΑΚΟΙΝΩΘΕΙ ο δίσκος, ήμουν αρκετά επιφυλακτικός. Όχι απλά γιατί μιλάμε για έναν ακόμα δίσκο μετά το πέρας του καλλιτεχνικού και δημιουργικού peak του Kanye, αλλά περισσότερο γιατί θα συνεργαζόταν με τον Ty$. Μια σύμπραξη μεταξύ του πρωταγωνιστή του influence στη σύγχρονη ποπ, αλλά και στο ίδιο το ραπ, με έναν R&B καλλιτέχνη είναι σίγουρα κάτι το ενδιαφέρον, μπαίνουν αμφιβολίες όμως στο παιχνίδι όταν αυτός είναι ο πιο νερόβραστος καλλιτέχνης του μοντέρνου R&B.
Όμως, ακριβώς λόγω της generic φύσης που έχει το artistry του Ty$, έχει αποδείξει πολλές φορές ότι μπορεί να προσαρμοστεί άψογα σε διαφορετικά ηχοχρώματα, ένας μουσικός χαμαιλεοντισμός που με τις κατάλληλες κατευθυντήριες γραμμές από έναν έμπειρο οραματιστή μπορεί να αποδώσει.
Το πείραμα κρίνεται ως επιτυχές. Ο Ty$ είναι το μοναδικό highlight ενός κενού κατά τα άλλα δίσκου. Μετά και την κυκλοφορία του «Utopia» από το πνευματικό παιδί του Kanye, τον Travis Scott, έχουν ανθίσει οι καρποί που είχαν σπείρει δίσκοι σαν το «My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy».
Ο Kanye είναι σίγουρα ακόμα εδώ, άλλωστε το πέρασμα της δημιουργικής κορύφωσης δεν συνεπάγεται απαραίτητα και καλλιτεχνική απονέκρωση, δεν έχει καταστήσει όμως σαφές προς τα πού θέλει να κινηθεί και τι ακριβώς θέλει να εκφράσει.
Περνάμε στη σφαίρα των μεγάλων, εκκωφαντικών, blockbuster ραπ δίσκων, που προσπαθούν να αναγάγουν την ημερομηνία κυκλοφορίας τους αλλά και την ίδια τους την ουσία σε πολλά περισσότερα από ένα δείγμα μουσικής. Είναι δίσκοι που αποτελούν συλλογικά, παγκόσμια events, οι οποίοι όμως θα πρέπει να προσπαθήσουν διπλάσια να υπερασπιστούν την υπόληψή τους για να μη μείνουν εν τέλει στην ιστορία ως πυροτεχνήματα.
Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign - Back to Me (featuring Freddie Gibbs)
Εδώ είναι που χωλαίνει το «Vultures». Είναι ένα κενό συνονθύλευμα πειραματισμών και διαφόρων άγουρων καλλιτεχνικών ιδεών. Αν πάρουμε ως δεδομένο ότι θα κυκλοφορήσουν εν τέλει τα άλλα δύο ανακοινωθέντα volumes, πρόκειται για μια θολή εισαγωγή σε ένα project που δεν έχει προσανατολισμό.
ΔΕΙΤΕ ΑΚΟΜΑ ΟΠΤΙΚΗ ΓΩΝΙΑ Ό,τι αγγίζει πια ο Κάνιε Γουέστ από θησαυρός γίνεται κάρβουνο
Με λιγότερη συνοχή από το «Donda», παρά τις επιδέξιες προσπάθειες του Ty$, έχουμε μια φουτουριστική παρουσίαση όλων των παραγωγικών περιόδων του Kanye, από τον παραδοσιακό, ορθόδοξο soulful ήχο του Σικάγο στο «College Dropout» έως το gospel του «Jesus Is King». Μια παρουσίαση που, στο πλαίσιο του τελικού προγραμματισμού, καταλήγει σε ένα ιδιαίτερο post-club celebration της club κουλτούρας της γενέτειράς του.
Στιχουργικά ο Kanye προσφέρει στον δημόσιο διάλογο περισσότερη διχογνωμία, δηλώνοντας από το intro ακόμα του δίσκου «Keep a few Jews on the staff now», αναφερόμενος στα συνεχόμενα αντισημιτικά rant του. Και εκεί σταματάει κάθε τι ενδιαφέρον. Υπερσεξουαλικοποίηση, ego, πλουτισμός, ego, διφορούμενες μπάρες για το σούσουρο, κι άλλο ego.
Ενώ υπάρχουν στιγμές μέσα στο άλμπουμ όπου αποτινάσσει το ναρκισσιστικό του πέπλο και επανανθρωποποιείται, όπως με το «Who's not entertained by my pain», στο «Burn», σαν σε μηχανισμό άμυνας τα ξεχνάει όλα σε δευτερόλεπτα και επανέρχεται στο επτασφράγιστο φρούριό του, όπου, όπως έχει αφήσει πολλές φορές να εννοηθεί, μόνο τα παιδιά του έχουν πρόσβαση.
BEG FORGIVENESS - Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign ft. Chris Brown
Στις συνεργασίες βλέπουμε μια παρέλαση από σύγχρονους σταρ τόσο του ραπ όσο και του R&B (και τον Rich The Kid) να προσφέρουν πραγματικά τον καλύτερο εαυτό τους στο πολιτισμικό συμβάν του «Vultures», με κυριότερα highlights το κουπλέ του Freddie Gibbs στο, αδικημένο ίσως από τη μίξη, «Back To Me» και τα φωνητικά του Chris Brown στο καλύτερο κομμάτι του δίσκου για μένα, το «Beg Forgiveness».
Ο Kanye είναι σίγουρα ακόμα εδώ, άλλωστε το πέρασμα της δημιουργικής κορύφωσης δεν συνεπάγεται απαραίτητα και καλλιτεχνική απονέκρωση, δεν έχει καταστήσει όμως σαφές προς τα πού θέλει να κινηθεί και τι ακριβώς θέλει να εκφράσει. Δεν νοείται ότι από τον ενορχηστρωτή του σύγχρονου μουσικού οικοσυστήματος πλέον θα αρκούμαστε σε απλά καλά mid άλμπουμ.
Ας κάνει μια παύση να επαναδιαπραγματευτεί την κατεύθυνσή του και τα πράγματα που αληθινά θέλει να εκφράσει, άλλωστε δεν είναι υπόλογος σε κάποια εταιρεία και το μόνο σίγουρο είναι πως δεν τον ζορίζει κάποιο deadline. Αγωνία και ενδιαφέρον σίγουρα για τα δύο επόμενα μέρη της τριλογίας, βαθμολογικά όμως ο πιλότος δυστυχώς ήταν flop/5.",2024-02-18T06:11:51Z,https://www.lifo.gr,LiFO mobile
Kim Kardashian reclama da pouca roupa da mulher de Kanye West,"Kanye West fotografa a esposa / Reprodução / Instagram /@kanyewest
As roupas – ou pouca roupa – que a esposa de Kanye West, Bianca Censori, anda usando em público à pedido do marido, tem causado um impacto negativo em algumas pessoas, principalmente na ex-mulher, Kim Kardashian.
Plataformas retiram novo álbum de Kanye West do ar
Essas ideias mirabolantes de Kanye nunca foram aceitas por Kim enquanto eram um casal, mas agora ele encontrou a pessoa ideal que não se importa em atender seus pedidos mais bizarros.
E isso tem causado atrito em seu relacionamento com a empresária, mãe dos quatro filhos do rapper e estilista.
Segundo a imprensa inglesa, Kim exigiu a West que Bianca não ande assim, sem roupa, perto de seus filhos. Sua exigência vem depois que supostamente a filha North West viu um clipe de Censori no TikTok.
Dizem que Kim Kardashian ficou furiosa.

Coincidência ou não, pela primeira vez em meses, Bianca Censori foi fotografada abandonando sua pouca roupa habitual quando se dirigia para um jantar em Florença, Itália, no “Valentine’s Day” (14 de fevereiro) com Kanye.
Para o encontro, Censori vestiu um longo sobretudo de couro preto. As fotos também mostraram a nativa australiana combinando o visual com saltos pretos, já que ela tinha o cabelo preto penteado para trás.

No entanto, não se sabe o que Bianca usava por baixo do casaco.
Defendendo Escolhas
O novo look da arquiteta surge dias depois de Kanye usar o Instagram para defender as roupas que a esposa usa.
Através de um vídeo, mostrando seus enormes dentes de titânio, basicamente Ye disse que ‘os incomodados que se mudem’, já que quem não quer ver o que ela posta nas redes sociais, simplesmente não entrem aí.
O rapper afirmou que é feliz em postar fotos da esposa:
“Gente, só quero dizer a todos que postei minha esposa três vezes de propósito”, disse West à câmera, olhando para Censori, que usava um macaquinho branco “molhado” e botas pretas de salto alto enquanto se escondia da câmera.
“Então o que estou dizendo é que entreguei o álbum. E as pessoas ainda estão nos meus comentários falando sobre: ‘Por que você está postando sua esposa?’
Kim Kardashian recusa pedido de Kanye West
“Porque ela me faz feliz. É por isso que vocês estão felizes com a música, porque estou feliz. Você entende?”, disse o rapper.
“Portanto, nunca diga nada negativo”, disse West. “Se você não gosta da minha página e não gosta do que estou postando, vá se fod*r. Sério, deixe-me – deixe o rei – em paz”, comentou.
“Eu não me importo, mano. Vou postar minha esposa o quanto eu quiser. Vá postar sua esposa na porr* do seu Instagram”, concluiu o cantor.",2024-02-18T04:10:00Z,https://www.ofuxico.com.br,OFuxico
"Kanye West's “Beg Forgiveness"" Lyrics Save Stranded Skier's Life","Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign's eagerly anticipated new project, Vultures 1, finally arrived last weekend. As the first of three volumes, the album has already managed to make a huge splash. Aside from topping the charts, Ye's received some major backlash for some of the project's controversial lyrics. The Chicago MC also got called out by Ozzy Osbourne and Donna Summer's estate for allegedly using samples without permission.
Regardless, Vultures 1 has been well received by many, and has even reportedly saved a life. During a recent chat with The San Francisco Chronicle, Mike Petkov recalled getting lost on a skiing trip in Kirkwood. He claims that to remain hopeful as he awaited rescue, he recited lyrics from Ye and Ty Dolla Sign's track with Chris Brown, “Beg Forgiveness.”

Mike Petkov Recalls Reciting Lyrics While Awaiting Rescue
“I thought I was getting into one of those cool backside areas where, if I got stuck, I’d be fine,” Petkov described. “I purposefully didn’t look at the trail map too much because I’ve had a lot of fun exploring [ski areas] and seeing where the day takes me.” In a turn of events, he ended up losing service, leaving him stranded. Fortunately, he was eventually able to contact some friends to give them his coordinates. At that point, however, it was too late. He had to wait overnight to get help, which is when Ye's lyrics came in handy.
According to him, he continuously recited the lyrics, “You’ve gone too far and you should hang your head in shame/ Don’t die/ Don’t die,"" which helped him stay alive. “I don’t blame Kirkwood. I should have at least had a little bit of a plan and an outlook of the resort,” Petkov says of the incident. “And then, just don’t YOLO too much.” What do you think of a man claiming that Vultures 1 lyrics saved his life during a skiing trip?

"Rapper Kanye West behauptet, Taylor Swift geholfen zu haben","Die Diskussion um Kanye West (46) und Taylor Swift (34) nimmt kein Ende. Taylors Fans wollen wohl verhindern, dass Kanye mit seinem neuen Album unter die Top 100 der Billboard Charts kommt. Ein Fan rief im Netz dazu auf, Beyoncés (42) neue Single ""TEXAS HOLD 'EM"" zu hören, um den Rapper von der Liste zu drängen. Daraufhin meldete sich Kanye zu Wort: Unter anderem stellte der Sänger die These auf, dass er Taylor bei ihrer Karriere geholfen hätte.
Unter seinem Instagram-Post schrieb er: ""Ich bin mir sicher, dass ich der Karriere von Taylor Swift mehr geholfen habe, als ihr geschadet zu haben."" Zusätzlich kritisierte der Rapper die Narrative, die die Medien über ihn und Taylor geschaffen hatten. Er erinnerte an die Zeit, in der er offensichtlich auf ihrer Seite war, als Musikmanager Scooter Braun (42) ihr die Rechte an ihren Alben genommen hatte. ""An alle Taylor-Swift-Fans, ich bin nicht euer Feind, aber ich bin auch nicht euer Freund"", fügte er hinzu.
Zudem wehrte er sich gegen die Gerüchte, dass Travis Kelces (34) Freundin den vierfachen Vater aus dem Super Bowl verbannen wollte. ""Ich wurde nicht aus dem Super Bowl rausgeschmissen, wir haben unsere Plätze verlassen, […] um andere Freunde zu sehen"", schrieb er auf Instagram.

Kanye's 'Vultures' Samples Including Black Sabbath Use Are Not Cleared,"Even after Ozzy Osbourne denied Kanye West‘s sampling request on his new album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 1, elements of the Black Sabbath hit “Iron Man” still appear on the album.
The version of Vultures 1 that West released does not use that sample of Ozzy Osbourne’s solo band performing “Iron Man” at the 1983 Us Festival. Instead, it uses a sample of West’s own track, “Hell of a Life,” released in 2010 with Universal Music Group (UMG), which also includes an interpolation of Black Sabbath’s “Iron Man” guitar riff. This use would likely also require approval from the members of that band — Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward — all of whom have writing and publishing credits on “Hell of a Life.”
Because “Hell of a Life” includes several samples, there are actually more songwriters on that track than on “Iron Man” alone. They also include swamp rocker Tony White Joe and Sylvester Stewart, better known as Sly Stone. The Stewart song comes from a sample of “She’s My Baby” by The Mojo Men, a band which Stewart played with and wrote for early on in his career. Randall Wixen, founder of Wixen Music Publishing, which represents “She’s My Baby” and controls a 35% stake in the “Hell of a Life” songwriting and publishing, confirms the “Carnival” use was not cleared by his company either.
Trending on Billboard
“It’s ironic that Kanye replaced the unlicensed sample of the Ozzy Osbourne track ‘Iron Man’ with a sample of ‘Hell of a Life,’ which also samples a song by Osbourne and Tony Iommi,” says Wixen. “So, he’s just substituted one unauthorized Ozzy sample for another and now brought our song into the picture. In a perfect world, all samples would be approved and cleared prior to release. It is basic respect for the songwriter.”
It’s not the only unlicensed use of a song or recording on the record, either. A spokesperson for Primary Wave, which has a partnership with James Brown‘s estate, tells Billboard that a use of The Godfather of Soul’s oft-sampled “Funky President (People It’s Bad)” was not cleared for use on the Vultures 1 track “Fuk Sumn.”
It is not unusual for albums to be released with unsettled songwriter splits, often to writers and publishers’ consternation. It’s less common that an album is released without clearing samples or interpolations, though Rell Lafargue, president and COO of Reservoir Media, says it still happens. But the level of West’s popularity — and notoriety — makes album an extreme example.
West’s team is working with the sample clearance company Alien Music Services to license these works and, according to multiple sources, they have so far secured a patchwork of licenses needed. Some works are cleared, others are not and some only partially. For example, Lafargue says Reservoir is currently negotiating the use of a sample of Brand Nubian‘s “Slow Down,” for the album track “Keys to My Life,” but the deal is not done yet. Multiple sources also say they were only approached with licensing requests after Vultures 1 was released last Saturday. Now the album is a serious contender to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart next week.
“On the level of Kanye in 2024 to put out an entire album with samples that haven’t even been requested to be cleared, I don’t think I’ve ever really seen that today,” says Lafargue, who helped release De La Soul’s recording catalog to streaming services last year after it was famously tied up in sample clearance issues. “That’s the exception for sure.”
This has already led to problems for the album. On Wednesday, the song “Good (Don’t Die)” was pulled from Spotify following a copyright infringement claim filed days earlier on behalf of Donna Summer‘s estate, and other streaming services soon followed suit. The estate claimed on a social media post that West’s team had asked for permission to use Summer’s iconic hit “I Feel Love” and had been denied, but the album was released with an interpolation on it anyway.
Separately, on Thursday, the platform used to distribute Vultures 1 to streaming services, FUGA, told Billboard it was removing the album from its systems. However, there was no suggestion that was related to sample or interpolation clearance issues. The album is now being distributed by Label Engine, a service owned by Create Music Group.
Che’ Pope from Yeezy Music says that licensing discussions are “in process” for the album and “everything’s in great shape, except for Ozzy Osbourne and Donna Summer.” He says that the Summer use should never have been released, and that the team is working on the “Carnival” issue now. With “Carnival,” Pope says West just needed a “guitar turnaround” on the track (the use appears around 1:43) and they can “figure out a way to play something else there,” unlike with “Good (Don’t Die)” where the interpolation was more material to the song. “There’s a few of us who play guitar,” Pope adds.
West plans to release Vultures as a trilogy project, and Pope says the licensing issues leading up to this album’s release were a matter of which songs were going to make the cut. “We didn’t know what was actually on the album until it got closer to release date,” he says. “So the thing is we had all the samples from what could potentially be all on any of the three volumes.”
It’s rare that streaming services will pull a major artist’s song over an unlicensed sample or interpolation. More typically, a deal is worked out between the artist’s and creators’ teams to put a license in place, and since the track is already out the artist loses leverage in those negotiations and will often give up a larger share of the rights. This was famously the case with The Verve‘s hit “Bittersweet Symphony,” which was based on a sample from a 1965 version of The Rolling Stones‘ song “The Last Time.” Since the band did not clear the song with The Rolling Stones’ former manager, Allen Klein, who owned the copyrights to their pre-1970 songs, frontman Richard Ashcroft was forced to relinquish all publishing to Klein’s company ABKCO Music and the songwriting credits were changed to The Stones’ Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.
While West built a name for himself as an all-time great hip-hop producer with exquisite use of samples and interpolations, with this release that’s been complicated by his recent history of antisemitism, starting in 2022 and after which he was widely condemned and lost numerous business deals. Speaking with Billboard on Feb. 9, Ozzy Osbourne’s wife and manager Sharon Osbourne noted that Ozzy often allows other artists to sample his work, “but the simple thing is, we don’t want to be associated with a hater.”
Sharon Osbourne, who is daughter of the U.K. music manager Don Arden and was raised Jewish, continued, “To spread hate the way he does, it shouldn’t be allowed. All the excuses — he’s bipolar or whatever — doesn’t change that. It’s like, f— you, basically.”
In all, Vultures 1 has at least two dozen samples and interpolations across 16 tracks, according to the website WhoSampled.com and reviewed by Billboard. Those include several uses of West’s own older music, like with “Hell of a Life” on “Carnival” and his 2012 track “Cold” on “Vultures” — all of which would presumably require licenses with UMG, under which he released those earlier recordings. There are also uses of samples from the film Dogma and a TikTok video of a cheer group and an interview with Mike Tyson from a podcast with Hollywood Unlocked’s Jason Lee, who was formerly West’s head of media and partnerships. And, of course, there is a lot of other creators’ music.
Pope says the licensing process on this album has not been “different from any album” prior, but adds that as West’s first proper release as an independent artist after he no longer benefits from easier clearances within the UMG system. (Aside from West’s own tracks, the UMG record samples include “Back That Azz Up (Back That Thang Up)” by Juvenile, “Bring the Noise” by Public Enemy and “Jubilation” by Pierre Henry and Spooky Tooth, among others.) There are also the image issues. “The landscape, his reality is different,” says Pope. “He’s got an uphill battle in certain areas. Clearing samples is never easy, but this one is more challenging just because of how the landscape on everything is.”
Most record labels and publishers contacted for this story declined to comment, with many saying they do not speak on individual licensing deals and that their policy is to follow their artists’ and songwriters’ wishes in these cases. Not every artist and songwriter involved, however, may know that their work is featured on Vultures 1.
Indie R&B artist Dijon posted to Instagram Stories on Feb. 9, a day before the album’s release, suggesting that he was unaware his song “Good Luck” was being sampled on the track “Stars”. (Now Pope says Dijon “should be good,” though, and the artist’s reps declined to comment.) Wixen and Primary Wave only learned of their creators’ uses on the album until Billboard contacted the companies, and considering the complexity of licensing a sample that contains a sample, it’s easy to imagine that some rights holders still don’t know their work is being used.
Edie Brickell & the New Bohemians, for example, according to the Songview database, have songwriting credits on Brand Nubian’s “Slow Down” because it samples their 1988 hit “What I Am.” Universal Music Publishing Group, which reps the band’s publishing on the song did not respond to request for comment.
The song “Fuk Sumn” also samples late Three 6 Mafia member Koopsta Knicca‘s underground single “Smoking on a J,” which itself samples the Days of Our Lives theme song and Isaac Hayes‘ “Walk From Regio’s” off the 1971 Shaft soundtrack, according to WhoSampled.com and Billboard‘s own review.
West’s own “So Appalled” from 2010 is sampled on the track “Problematic,” but that also includes Manfred Mann on the songwriting credits due to a sample of “You Are – I Am,” according to Songview.
All said, a project like Vultures 1 could require upwards of 50 clearances, says Danny Zook, CEO of Alien Music Services. “We are working diligently to clear all the samples on this project,” he says.",2024-02-17T20:19:21Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Kanye West annonce un concert surprise le 25 février à l’Accor Arena de Paris,"David Livingston / Getty Images David Livingston / Getty Images
MUSIQUE - Son public répondra-t-il présent, même à la dernière minute ? Étrangement, c’est pour un sujet musical que Ye -le nouveau nom de Kanye West- fait parler de lui ce samedi 17 février. Cette fois pas de polémique pour le rappeur américain de 46 ans.
L’auteur de l’album Vultures 1 a en effet annoncé sur son compte Instagram qu’il allait se produire sur scène en Europe durant les prochains jours. Une mini-tournée pour laquelle une date a été réservée en France, le 25 février à l’Accor Arena de Paris. Une date qui coïncide d’ailleurs avec la Fashion Week parisienne, un événement auquel il a l’habitude de se rendre à New York, comme à Paris.
Le rappeur américain est également attendu en Italie quelques jours plus tôt. À Milan le 22 février, avant la Bologna Unipol Arena deux jours plus tard. Cette tournée prévoit également un passage par les États-Unis.
Comme l’indique Le Parisien, les places pour le concert parisien de Kanye West seront disponibles à la vente à partir du mardi 20 février.
HIstoire(s) de plagiat
Dévoilé le 10 février, son album commun avec Ty Dolla Sign a déjà fait couler beaucoup d’encre. Et ce n’est pas uniquement pour la qualité de ses morceaux, qui se sont très vite hissés au sommet des tops musicaux mondiaux. Mais plutôt pour une histoire, ou plutôt des histoires de plagiat.
En effet, la sortie de cet album a été perturbée plusieurs heures par un morceau (Good (Don’t Lie)) samplé sur une chanson de Donna Summer (I Feel Love) qui a entraîné un retrait temporaire de l’album sur certaines plateformes musicales. Un premier problème de courte durée, contrairement à celui qui oppose désormais Ye à la rockstar Ozzy Osbourne.
Ce dernier a récemment accusé le rappeur dans un tweet incendiaire d’avoir utilisé sans son accord un extrait du live Iron Man (1983), du groupe Black Sabbath, alors qu’Ozzy Osbourne avait refusé cette demande. L’ex-leader du groupe de rock britannique avait expliqué que le caractère « antisémite » de Kanye West avait largement pesé dans sa décision.

"Kanye West's ""Carnival"" Gets Intense Cover Art","Kanye West has unveiled the intense cover art for ""Carnival"", one of the standout tracks from the recently released Vultures 1. Designed by noted Canadian artist Jon Rafman, the cover art for ""Carnival"" depicts a close-up of a screaming and bloodied skinhead. Rafman also created the AI-generated music video for Vultures (Havoc Version) that was released alongside the album.
""Carnival"" features Playboi Carti and Rich the Kid. As mentioned, it is widely considered one of the best tracks on Vultures 1. Many people have already called it the best song of 2024. However, the song proved controversial even before it was released. A version heard at a listening party in Chicago earned the ire of Ozzy Osbourne due to an uncleared sample of Black Sabbath. A later version at a Long Island listening party used a sample of Kanye's ""Hell of a life"", which interpolates the same Black Sabbath song.

Kanye West Drops New Vultures 1 Cover But Fans Still Have Issues
Meanwhile, late last Saturday, Kanye dropped a new version of the cover art for his album, Vultures 1. The Jason Vorhees-esque hockey mask won by a figure on the album cover has been changed from white to black. However, the change was not the one that more modest fans were hoping for. Many fans still had issues with the scantily clad Bianca Censori who also appears on the cover. ""How am I supposed to play this in my car and my mom sees this album cover,"" one fan asked. ""Wasn’t he complaining about his baby momma being too sexual to raise his kids,"" noted another. ""Salam brother Kanye, can we please get a Halal version of the cover. Thank you,"" requested a third.
The week before the album dropped, Kanye posted an image to his Instagram story of himself and Censori showing off their respective phone backgrounds. West's was a picture of Censori wearing a leather bikini. Meanwhile, Censori's was a picture of someone dressed as Jason Vorhees. While Censori appears to be topless on the cover of Vultures 1, it is now relatively evident that the innocuous photo was a backdoor teaser for the cover art.

Insider Claims Kim Kardashian Has One Rule For Whenever Kanye West’s New Wife Bianca Censori Is Around Their Kids,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have long since parted ways as a couple and finalized their divorce in November 2022. West eventually moved on with Yeezy architectural designer Bianca Censori, who he legally married in December 2022. Since then, there have been varying reports about Kardashian’s feelings towards her ex’s new bride. While the two stars may no longer be together, they remain in each other’s orbits, because they share four kids. As West reportedly spends time with his children, it’s been claimed that Kardashian has one rule about that whenever Censori is around the little ones.
As of late, Ye and his wife have been making headlines for more than a few reasons, with one of the biggest being that the Mrs. is known to sport racy attire when in public. The rapper, for his part, posts about a number of these looks on social media. Many have taken notice of Bianca Censori’s distinct style at this point, and that apparently includes Kim Kardashian. An insider spoke to DailyMail.com and alleged that the media mogul has asked her former husband to ensure that Censori (who she was accused of having hated for years ) doesn’t dress in such a way when she’s around their kids:
Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids. She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that.
In many cases, the public has seen Kanye West’s wife in attire that leaves her scantily clad. Last year, for example, she went viral after being seen wearing nothing but body tape for a photoshoot. West also posted a (now-deleted) photo of earlier this year on Instagram, in which she was wearing a fur bandeau top and a small pair of underwear. The “Stronger” performer used that post to signify what he referred to as the year of “no pants.” The model was also seen wearing an outfit that barely covered her breasts while she was at Super Bowl LVIII last weekend.
This series of skimpy outfits have had some wondering just how much control Bianca Censori has over what she wears. In late 2023, a collaborator of West’s shot down the notion that he picks out all of his wife’s clothes . Though some still seem to believe that he controls that and other aspects of her life, with one source even saying that Ye has rules for Censori . (That supposedly includes that she never speaks.) While such claims were never made amid Kim Kardashian’s marriage to the Grammy winner, the SKIMS founder was candid about her ex-husband cleaning out her closet when they got together. DailyMail.com’s insider seemingly referenced that while providing these sentiments:
Kanye did the same thing he is doing with Bianca to Kim throughout their marriage. The difference is that when Kanye dressed Kim, he was respected as a person – as an artist. Unfortunately, Kim knows what Bianca is going through – but she feels Bianca should have known what she was getting into.
Kim Kardashian shares North (10), Saint (8), Chicago (6) and Psalm (4) with Kanye West. Despite their relationship and the rapper’s string of controversies, they seem to be moving all with their co-parenting efforts. Whether or not the supposed rule regarding how Bianca Censori dresses is unclear at this point. And, if it is, one can only speculate as to whether Censori and West would actually oblige.",2024-02-17T15:42:04Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Kanye West Claims He Has Been More 'Helpful' for Taylor Swift’s Career Than 'Harmful',"Kanye ""Ye"" West has once again ignited discussion surrounding his ongoing relationship with pop sensation Taylor Swift, as tensions between his fanbase and Swift's devoted followers, known as ""Swifties,"" reach a boiling point.

West took to Instagram to address what he termed a ""Swiftie Emergency."" This emergency, he explained, involved Swift's fans rallying to stream Beyoncé's latest track, ""Texas Hold Em,"" to prevent West from securing a no. 1 debut on the charts with his collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 1. In his Instagram post, West asserted that he has been more beneficial than detrimental to Swift's career, despite their past conflicts. West's album, notably the song Carnival, sparked debate due to a mention of Swift.

The rapper shared a screenshot of a post from X (formerly known as Twitter), in which a user-declared a ""SWIFTIE EMERGENCY,"" urging followers to support Beyoncé's single to thwart West's chart success. West's album, notably the song Carnival, sparked debate due to a mention of Swift. He emphasized that the mention was not intended as a direct aim at Swift and expressed appreciation for the spotlight his music receives.

Acknowledging Swift and Beyoncé as significant influences in the music industry, West attempted to reconcile with Swift's fans by stating that he was neither their enemy nor their friend. Furthermore, West refuted claims that Swift had him and his wife, Bianca Censori, removed from the Super Bowl after he allegedly purchased seats near her suite. The ongoing feud between West and Swift originated from the 2009 VMAs, where West infamously interrupted Swift's acceptance speech, causing widespread criticism.
Kanye West team sent him a report saying that his $0 Production budget Super Bowl ad was a success. The 30 second slot cost $7,000,000 which generated Yeezy 284,357 orders totaling $19.3 Million in sales in less than 24 hours. 😳 pic.twitter.com/wUMrzxnVJO — Black Millionaires ® (@Blackmillions_) February 12, 2024
Despite recent calm, tensions resurfaced when West seemingly shaded Swift in an Instagram post. Subsequently, his newly released album, Vultures, encountered an unexpected setback as it was reportedly removed from iTunes and Apple Music. Fans noticed an error message stating, ""The page you’re looking at can’t be found,"" prompting action from the distribution company, FUGA, to collaborate with Digital Service Providers (DSPs) for the album's removal from various platforms, including Apple.

In response to recent events, a spokesperson from the company issued an official statement, explaining, ""Late last year, FUGA had the opportunity to release Vultures 1. Following our standard business practices, we chose not to proceed."" The statement further elaborated on it revealing, ""On Friday, Feb. 9, 2024, a longstanding client of FUGA submitted the album Vultures 1 through our platform's automated processes, which breached our service agreement.""
The spokesperson concluded by stating, ""Consequently, FUGA is actively collaborating with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures from our systems."" Despite this development, the album remains accessible on other streaming platforms such as Spotify and Amazon Music for Ye fans.",2024-02-17T08:35:07Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Kanye West And Ty Dolla $ign To Host Two More Listening Parties In Italy,"Last week, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign finally dropped their new album VULTURES 1. The project was teased for months as one release date after another passed. Eventually it was announced that the project would be split into three volumes. The first chance fans had to hear the final project came during a listening party the duo threw in Chicago that fans online could also pay to tune into.
Despite the album now having already been released, they just announced some new listening parties to play it for fans in person. The two shows will bring VULTURES to Italy later this month. The first event will take place in Milan on February 22. The second will take place in Bologna a few days later on February 24. Some fans may want to attend a listening party with the future of the album's availability on streaming services in question. The album was absent from Apple Music for multiple hours earlier this week following a dispute with the distributor for the project.

For fans who want to hear the duo perform the songs from VULTURES 1 rather than just listening to the album, they just made a big announcement. The pair will be headlining Rolling Loud California later this year. While there, the pair are likely to make the live debuts of many of the songs from the album. One of the songs on the album is currently unavailable on streaming. ""GOOD (DON'T DIE)"" was subject to a copyright claim made by the estate of Donna Summer.
It wasn't the only issue taken with the album's sampling. Ozzy Osbourne personally tweeted at West for using an uncleared sample during one of the listening parties. The sample in question was eventually replaced on the album itself. What do you think of Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign hosting more listening parties for VULTURES 1 even though it's already be released? Do you think the album will be able to stay on streaming services permanently? Let us know in the comment section below.

Kanye West stuffed his face as he and his wife, Bianca Censori, headed to dinner in Italy for Valentine’s Day Wednesday.
In photos obtained by Page Six, the “All of the Lights” rapper was seen chowing down on a sandwich while waiting for the Australian model to get into a black SUV in Florence.
He quickly finished his sandwich before also getting into the same vehicle.

The outing came days after the Grammy winner took to social media to defend himself against trolls who criticized him for posting risqué photos of his wife.
“Y’all, I just want to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose,” he told the camera in an Instagram video Monday while he and Censori — who was wearing a skin-tight YZY romper ($20) — were walking through an airport.

“So what I’m saying is, I delivered the album. And people still in my comments talking ’bout, ‘Why you posting your wife?’” he continued, referring to his and Ty Dolla $ign’s newly released album, “Vultures 1.”

“I don’t care bro. I’m going to post my wife as much as I want. Go post your wife on your f–king Instagram.”

Plataformas retiram novo álbum de Kanye West do ar,"Kanye West / Reprodução / Instagram /@kanyewest
Kanye West fez a alegria dos fãs ao lançar, finalmente, seu novo álbum “Vultures 1”, mas apenas cinco dias depois de sua estreia, a plataforma Apple Music rapidamente retirou o álbum por problemas de violação de direitos autorais.
Kanye West se compara a Elvis Presley
Na tarde de quinta-feira (15), o álbum – que conta com uma música de sua filha North West – foi removido da Apple Music e do iTunes, onde o tema “Carnival” ocupou o primeiro lugar no “Top 100: Global Chart”.
Segundo a revista “Billboard” a mudança ocorre em meio a relatos de que o distribuidor do Vultures 1 está trabalhando para removê-lo de todos os serviços de streaming.
Aparentemente Kanye subiu o álbum para várias plataformas sem permissão.
O álbum já teve problemas um dia antes, na Spotify, quando a plataforma resolveu remover a faixa “Good (Don’t Die)” devido a alegações de ‘violação de direitos autorais’.
O tema contém material da falecida cantora Donna Summer.
Kim Kardashian recusa pedido de Kanye West
A distribuidora FUGA, disse em comunicado:
“Na sexta-feira um cliente de longa data da FUGA entregou o álbum Vultures 1 por meio de processos automatizados da plataforma, violando nosso contrato de serviço.”
“Portanto, a FUGA está trabalhando ativamente com seus parceiros e com o cliente para remover o Vultures 1 de nossos sistemas.”

Kanye West Bringing 'Vultures 1' Events to Italy With Ty Dolla Sign,"The rumors arrived on Thursday (Feb. 15) evening, and now everything is confirmed officially. Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign will be in Italy next week to present their joint album Vultures 1 at two listening parties, one in Milan (Feb. 22) and another Bologna (Feb. 24).
Announced as “a hi-fidelity audio experience,” tickets for the two events are available from 3pm CET today (Feb. 16).
Released after several postponements, Vultures 1 has been at the center of controversy in recent days. The issues primarily involve sampling without permission: Backstreet Boys’ “Everybody” and a live Ozzy Osbourne performance of “Iron Man.” The latter was later replaced (on the Vultures 1 song “Carnival”) by an interpolation of “Hell of a Life” from Ye’s own My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
Finally, there was a dispute with the Donna Summer estate over the copyright of the song “I Feel Love,” sampled on the track “Good (Don’t Die).” The song was removed from streaming platforms yesterday but was later made available again.
Trending on Billboard
For quite some time there has been a special bond between Kanye West and Italy. Last August he made a controversial appearance at the Venice Film Festival, where he was photographed with his trousers pulled down on a boat. Then, at the end of October, a large concert was supposed to take place at the RCF Arena in Reggio Emilia (an open-air venue with a capacity of 100,000 people). The show was then cancelled, although it was never officially announced.
Finally, for the music video of the new single “Talking / Once Again,” he relied on an Italian creative team. Matteo Cocco is director of photography and the directors are brothers Damiano and Fabio D’Innocenzo. The latter have always publicly expressed their admiration for Ye’s music.

"North West Draws Kanye West's ""Vultures 1"" Album Cover, Reveals Her Favorite Song On The Album","North West has been in the news quite a bit over these past few days. Overall, a lot of this stems from the fact that she was on her father's new album Vultures 1. She can be found on the track ""Talking"" where she delivers her debut rap verse. Although it may not be extremely lyrical, some have seen it as the highlight of the album. After all, North is a lot like her father in many respects, and fans think she can be a superstar one day. If anything, this is her first step to getting on that trajectory.
Vultures 1 has certainly been through the wringer as of late. There has been a whole lot of drama around the album, especially as it pertains to distribution. For instance, the album was taken off Apple Music. However, it was eventually put back on the platform fairly soon after. Now, North West is showing her appreciation towards the album. In a journal, North revealed what she appreciates the most right now. Of course, all of her answers were Vultures 1 related. Moreover, she even delivered a drawing of the album cover.

Disco de Kanye West sai e volta a streaming da Apple após conflito na distribuição,"O rapper Kanye West enfrenta uma série de problemas relacionados ao álbum “Vultures 1”, lançado neste mês
SÃO PAULO, SP (FOLHAPRESS) –
O rapper Kanye West enfrenta uma série de problemas relacionados ao álbum “Vultures 1”, lançado neste mês.
Isso porque a Apple Music e o Itunes removeram o álbum de seus catálogos nesta quinta-feira (15) por problemas com a distribuidora do disco.
Em entrevista à revista Billboard, a empresa distribuidora diz que um cliente enviou às plataformas o álbum por meio de processos automatizados, violando o contrato de serviço. Por isso, decidiu retirar o disco dos serviços de streaming. Após o imbróglio, o trabalho já está disponível novamente nas plataformas.
Já no último dia 9, o rapper teve uma transmissão ao vivo interrompida após se declarar antissemita. Ele revelava faixas de “Vultures”, na plataforma Veeps, em uma transmissão a partir do ginásio esportivo Chicago’s United Center, vestindo uma máscara de Jason, personagem de “Sexta-feira 13”.
Além disso, o músico Ozzy Osbourne se recusou a deixá-lo usar trechos da música “Iron Man” em uma faixa do disco e chamou o cantor de antissemita.
Apesar da proibição, West teria reproduzido a canção do “Vultures 1” durante uma festa. Ela, porém, não está na versão final do álbum.
Já os detentores dos direitos do catálogo de Donna Summer afirmam que o cantor incluiu no disco trechos da canção “I Feel Love” mesmo não tendo sido autorizado a usá-la. A música foi removida do Spotify em razão do imbróglio.
CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE
Sobre as plataformas de streaming terem removido suas músicas, ele diz que tal atitude só o ajudou. “Somos número um. Enquanto eu respirar, estarei aqui pelos meus artistas.

"Kanye West in Italia a sorpresa, concerto al Forum di Assago di Milano e all'Unipol Arena","Le due date si annunciano come “listening party”, ovvero, esperienze di ascolto che saranno diverse dai classici concerti. Il format riprende quello pensato per il live, mai realizzato, di cui si era parlato lo scorso autunno. Col rapper sul palco anche Ty Dolla $ign
I fan di Kanye West sanno che bisogna stare sempre con le antenne dritte quando si tratta del proprio beniamino poiché le sue mosse arrivano, molto spesso, in maniera inaspettata.
Non c'è da sorprendersi, dunque, che il rapper e poliedrico artista abbia deciso di fare una doppia apparizione in Italia tra pochissimi giorni, due appuntamenti storici, per i quali i biglietti saranno disponibili a brevissimo.
Da oggi, venerdì 16 febbraio, a partire dalle ore 15:00, saranno aperte le vendite dei ticket per i due live di Milano e Bologna fissati rispettivamente per il 22 febbraio al Forum di Assago e per il 24 febbraio 2024 all’Unipol Arena di Bologna.
L'annuncio è arrivato sui canali ufficiali di Vivo Concerti e D'Alessandro e Galli, organizzatori e promoter degli eventi. La vendita, aperta esclusivamente su TicketOne ha già mandato in tilt i fan.
Due esperienze di ascolto di Volture Vol. 1 Kanye West si esibirà in Italia, la notizia sembra essere ormai ufficiale, vista la dovizia di particolari che riguardano l'evento di cui si è vociferato tanto e che ora, finalmente, assume contorni concreti.
Il rapper, produttore e musicista, nonché artista che ha superato Taylor Swift in termini di ascolti in streaming su Spotify, ha scelto l'Italia per esibirsi per due esperienze audio che suonano come dei veri e propri appuntamenti imperdibili.
Le date al Forum di Assago e all'Unipol Arena, che si terranno a un giorno di distanza l'una dall'altra, più che tradizionali concerti, saranno occasioni per ascoltare Volture Vol. 1, il lavoro di West uscito lo scorso 10 febbraio.
I due appuntamenti indoor saranno esperienze d'ascolto, ovvero, “listening party” non meno interessanti dei canonici live, specie perché sul palco con Ye ci sarà Ty Dolla $ign, altro membro del superduo hip hop che sta dietro all'album collaborativo che, come c'era da aspettarsi, ha già suscitato polemiche e reazioni. Tra queste, la più rilevante, è senz'altro la rimozione dallo streaming di alcuni brani che contengono suoni già esistenti e che West avrebbe usato senza autorizzazione.
Nello specifico, Good (Don't Die) è stato rimosso da Spotify poiché contiene campionamento di I Feel Love di Donna Summer non autorizzato dagli eredi dell'artista. Sulla questione Ye non ha fatto una piega e ha piuttosto invitato i fan ad acquistare l'album con tutte le canzoni su Yeezy.com. leggi anche Kanye West, il concerto a Reggio Emilia non si farà
I biglietti: date e modalità di vendita Per le due date, davvero imminenti, in Italia Kanye West avrebbe pensato a ciò che aveva previsto lo scorso ottobre a Reggio Emilia, evento annunciato e poi cancellato nell'area di Campovolo.
I fan sono ora disposti a darsi battaglia per ottenere i biglietti dei due eventi il cui costo partirebbe da centoquindici euro.
La vendita, aperta su TicketOne dalle ore 15:00 del 16 febbraio, si annuncia agguerrita, con ogni utente che potrà acquistare fino a sei biglietti, tutti nominativi e non rivendibili su fanSALE.it.
La speranza, per molti, è anche quella di riuscire ad ascoltare in anteprima qualcosa dei prossimi volumi di Volture, il 2 e il 3, la cui uscita è prevista per i prossimi 8 marzo e 5 aprile.

"Apple Music reinstates Kanye West's controversial new album 'Vultures 1"" after briefly removing it due to the artist's distributor disagreements","""Kanye West"" and ""trouble"" seem to go hand in hand it seems in recent years, whether he's saying massively controversial things, promoting horrible ideals, or supporting some of the worst people on earth. Now, however, he's in trouble for different reasons — and it led to his new album, Vultures 1, being removed from Apple Music for a short time.
Distributor issues for the worlds most controversial rapper
On February 15, Billboard reported that Kanye's album had been removed from Apple Music, updating the article a few hours later to say that the album had been brought back online.
The initial removal seemed to comply with a request from Kanye's music distribution platform of choice, Fuga Music. Fuga said of the issue to Billboard ""Late last year, FUGA was presented with the opportunity to release Vultures 1."" The spokesperson for the platform went on to say ""Exercising our judgment in the ordinary course of business, we declined to do so.”
Kanye didn't listen, apparently, and used the platform's ""automated release processes"" to release the album to different streaming sites, making Fuga less than pleased. “On Friday, Feb. 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement. Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.” said Fuga further — and not a few days later was Vultures 1 removed from Apple Music.
It's not entirely obvious how Vultures 1 has since returned to Apple's streaming platform — one can only assume that the distribution issues have been ironed out. That, or it was a technical glitch that has since been fixed. Either way, those curious can listen to the latest project from the mind of a self-confessed 'madman'. Vultures 1 is available to Apple Music customers and iTunes buyers now.",2024-02-16T11:27:20Z,https://www.imore.com,iMore
Halbnackte Bianca Censori: Tochter von Kanye West sorgt mit pikanter Zeichnung für Wirbel,"Los Angeles (USA) - Wieder Drama um Bianca Censori (29)! Die Designerin ist für ihre freizügigen Outfits und Nacktheit bereits in der Öffentlichkeit bekannt. Nun sorgte eine pikante Zeichnung von ihr, die auch noch von Kanye Wests (46) Tochter (10) stammt, für Wirbel im Netz!

Scrollt man sich durch das TikTok-Profil von Kim Kardashians (43) und Kanye Wests Tochter, so findet man vor allem Videos von Freunden und der Familie sowie jede Menge Schmink-Tutorials. Eigentlich nichts Verwerfliches für eine erst Zehnjährige.
Doch laut einem aktuellen Bericht der Daily Mail, hat ein kürzlich veröffentlichter Clip für Diskussionen im Netz gesorgt. Darin zu sehen war eine Zeichnung der kaum bekleideten Bianca Censori, die neben ihrem Ehemann Kanye West posiert! Das Bild ähnelte stark dem Album-Cover mit dem Titel ""Vultures"" (zu Deutsch: ""Geier"").
Dazu schrieb North West folgende Zeilen: ""Ich bin dankbar für das Album 'Vultures', weil es wahnsinnig gut ist. Ich bin auch dankbar für die schwarzen Geier, denn wenn es die Geier nicht gäbe, wäre dieses tolle Album nicht erschienen.""
Zudem sei die junge TikTokerin noch dankbar für den Song ""Carnival"" - ausgerechnet das Lied, welches aufgrund seines kontroversen und nicht jugendfreien Songtextes besonders umstritten ist. Bei Apple Musik sei Kanye Wests neuestes Album sogar schon entfernt worden.",2024-02-16T10:43:00Z,https://www.tag24.de,TAG24
Klare Ansage von Kim Kardashian an Kanye West wegen Bianca?,"Das passt ihr wohl nicht! Aus der jahrelangen Ehe von Kim Kardashian (43) und Kanye West (46) gehen vier Promi-Sprösslinge hervor – die Kinder North (10), Saint (8), Chicago (6) und Psalm (4). Mittlerweile ist Bianca Censori die neue Frau an der Seite des Rappers, doch die Turteltauben sorgen mit ihren intimen Einblicken immer wieder für Negativschlagzeilen – auch der Ex scheint das ein Dorn im Auge zu sein. Jetzt soll sich Kim an Kanye gewandt haben!
Die TV-Bekanntheit soll zu der neuen Partnerin ein freundschaftliches Verhältnis haben, doch von ihren knappen Outfits sei sie anscheinend überhaupt kein Fan. ""Kim hat Kanye angewiesen, dass Bianca sich niemals in der Nähe ihrer Kinder so kleiden darf"", berichtet ein Insider gegenüber Daily Mail. Sie sei überrascht, dass er sie so aus dem Haus gehen lasse.
Auch das private Umfeld der australischen Schönheit sei über ihren Auftritt besorgt, verrät eine andere Quelle. ""Ihre Familie und Freunde sind beschämt, weil es immer schlimmer wird"", heißt es. Auch rechtliche Konsequenzen befürchte die Familie der ehemaligen Yeezy-Mitarbeiterin – Nacktheit in dieser Form ist in Kalifornien nämlich verboten.

These are far from the only hiccups Ye has dealt with following the release of Vultures 1, however. Following the hitmaker's Chicago listening party, Ozzy Osbourne took to Twitter to accuse him of sampling Black Sabbath without permission.

Kanye West’s ‘Vultures 1’ Already Has a New Distributor,"Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign‘s collaborative album Vultures 1 moved between distribution companies on Thursday (Feb. 15), starting the day with FUGA and then moving over to Label Engine.
Label Engine, a distribution company acquired by Create Music Group in 2015, had previously put out the two lead singles from Vultures 1. Confusingly, however, the album then arrived via FUGA.
A FUGA spokesperson told Billboard on Thursday that “a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement.” As a result, the company said it planned “to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.” This created some turbulence for West’s release, which was briefly pulled off Apple Music and iTunes before it reappeared.
Trending on Billboard
The album’s new home, Label Engine, was founded by Rich Billis; in 2022, he said that “over 1,500 labels and a total of over 90,000 artists” use his company for distribution.
Billis said the company built its client base in part because “we had a very low [distribution] rate which was 15%, compared to 25% (what a lot of other distributors were charging).”
“We also provided free use of all the accounting and promotion tools I had created,” he continued. “That seemed to do very well. We quickly acquired customers and grew quite quickly in the upcoming years. From there, we got purchased by Create Music Group, which was a client of ours for a year or so. That’s when I took over as CTO of Create Music Group.”
On Wednesday, Spotify also removed the song “Good (Don’t Die)” from Vultures 1 after Donna Summer‘s estate complained it interpolated the singer’s work without permission, as did Amazon Music and Apple Music later, too.
But despite the hiccups around the new album release, listeners continue to seek it out. The song “Carnival” is No. 1 on Spotify’s Daily Top Songs Global chart, picking up nearly 6 million daily streams on the service. “Burn” and “FUK SUMN” are also in the top 20.",2024-02-15T22:37:27Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign's ""VULTURES 1"" Removed From Apple Music Amid Distribution Issues","Hours ago, there was a real possibility that Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's joint effort VULTURES 1 could be taken down from streaming services again. When the album initially came out, it made onto every DSP except Spotify. Shortly after fans got a chance to hear the record, it was suddenly off Apple Music without any explanation. Now, those suspicions were proven to be correct. If you head over to Apple Music right now, VULTURES 1 will have all of its songs removed.
The reason why numerous sources were predicting this was because the distributor of the record, FUGA, wanted it to be taken down. A client of theirs went above their word and helped release the record. According to Billboard, they received a direct message from a FUGA spokesperson. ""A long-standing FUGA client delivered the album VULTURES 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement. Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove VULTURES 1 from our systems.""

Well, their goal was achieved as Apple Music is without the record. However, at the time of writing, the record is still on Spotify and Amazon Music. The outlook for Ye and Ty's album was already gloomy, especially with all of the copyright issues with sample clearances. That is especially true of the feuds with Ozzy Osbourne and Donna Summer.

"Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign ""Vultures 1"" Review","It’s never easy witnessing the downfall of a cultural phenomenon, especially in the way that Kanye went from a beacon of hope to an artistic pariah who became more engulfed in controversy the further he was platformed. Unfortunately, the backlash wasn’t detached from his artistic output, and Ye has frequently failed to deliver an album without allowing his antics to overshadow it. In the case of Vultures 1, the first of three supposed collaborative albums between Ye and Ty Dolla $ign, that was almost the case. From listening events to hotel parties, the two artists delivered the album in different iterations as they tinkered with the final product and presumably, attempted to clear up some of the admin work attached with sample clearance.
At this point, Kanye West has gained notoriety for failing to release albums on schedule and the circus that surrounds these projects heavily contributes to the rollout. Unfortunately, that often means that, despite the wait, the music still sounds unfinished by the time it’s on DSPs and remains that way.
That’s the biggest difference between projects like Donda and Ye and Vultures 1. Though unveiled similarly, Kanye and Ty Dolla $ign's collaborative effort sounds like a labor of love rather than a byproduct of a new Yeezy campaign. For the first time in a while, there’s a common ground between Ye’s ideas and the execution, largely carried by Ty Dolla $ign’s stellar performances across the album and an attention to detail that was sorely missing in recent albums. However, where Ye lacks from a lyrical standpoint – and there are plenty of those moments – he makes up for tenfold through his production.
Vultures Lands
Without a fresh bout of controversy to go up against, Vultures 1 remains a rather smooth listen from front to back. Since 2015, the chemistry between Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign has delivered on all fronts with each collaboration. On Vultures 1, the two artists complement each other’s styles through plenty of contrast yet without losing a sense of cohesion. The two could weave through wholesome moments like “Talking/Once Again,” where North West makes an adorably assertive rap debut and Ty Dolla $ign leads the gospel to heavenly glory, then leap into a hypnotizingly muddy banger with “Hoodrat,” where Ye and Ty Dolla $ign capture the haziness of hotel afterparties and bathroom sex.
As a producer, Kanye’s ability to lead Ty Dolla $ign – and vice versa – allows the two of them to pull from each other’s respective strengths. Ty’s versatility made him a multi-faceted voice who could easily transition between touching ballads, ratchet bangers for the strip club, and soulful R&B with little effort. Through that, Ty becomes a vessel for Kanye’s ear, executing airy falsettos that elevate the orchestral production on “Stars” or his passionate earworm of a hook on “Burn” that allows Kanye to sound like he’s back in 2005. However, the familiarity that comes with both of these records feels like it lends itself to the formula that Kanye’s utilized since The Life Of Pablo, where he’s pulling ideas from his old catalog.
The Good & Bad Of ""Carnival""
Yet he finds new ways to innovate sonic motifs. Kanye often used choirs to bring a sense of spirituality and soul to his music, whether on The College Dropout or Jesus Is King. However, the way he utilizes it on “Carnival” is unlike anything he’s delivered recently. “Carnival” stands as the crown jewel of the 16-song collection, if only because of the rambunctious and drunken collection of European Ultras yelling “head so good, she honor roll” in unison. The blistering chants and grinding synthesizers fuel the high-octane energy, reminiscent of UK punk and sweaty mosh pits.
Despite this, Ye delivers one of his worst lyrical performances of the album, likening himself to R. Kelly and Bill Cosby before landing on Jesus but by that point, you’re startled by Kanye stating that he’s “#MeToo me rich.” No matter how you look at it, it’s a weak attempt to troll, whether he’s crusading against cancel culture or actually advocating for the innocence of sexual predators.

The MVPs? Freddie Gibbs & Playboi Carti
With a wide range of collaborators at their disposal, Kanye and Ty Dolla $ign brought through some unexpected features on the project. Playboi Carti’s appearance on “Carnival” marks one of two stellar performances on the album, alongside the hypnotic ode to Memphis, “F*CKSUMN.” Evolving his delivery from a deeper register adds a level of curiosity to his flow. It’s almost whimsically inquisitive when he emerges on “Carnival” and pays homage to SahBabii or when he asks, “Shawty wanna fuck?” on the latter.
Meanwhile, Freddie Gibbs delivers the verse of the album, if not the year so far on “Back To Me.” He swiftly turns Ye’s cheeky interpolation of Jay’s “beautiful big t*tty women just don’t fall out the sky you know” into a katana-sharp verse that’s equally playful and gruff with bars like, “Turn a bird bitch to my X like I was Elon.” Other standout moments on the project come from Chris Brown who delivers a haunting gospel on “Beg Forgiveness,” and Quavo means business on “Paperwork.” There’s a lot of heavy lifting from collaborators across the project, to the point where this album likely wouldn’t be as digestible without them.

YZY x TY$ Set The Stage
In its totality, Vultures 1 is the first album from Kanye West in a long time that feels like it isn’t trying to harness some bigger picture or push some sort of agenda outside of music. His vulnerability feels sincere on songs like the Timbaland-produced “Keys To My Life,” where he reflects on his dilapidated marriage to Kim Kardashian over sorrowfully pitched-up vocal samples of India Love. Fortunately, these moments are few and far between, which allows them to pack an even more potent punch on the tracklist.
Overall, Kanye sounds like he’s having a blast and it's refreshing to hear. Ty’s penchant for smooth, sexually charged pen and Kanye’s flagrantly grotesque bars that often lean into the TMI territory fuel the self-indulgent tones. This level of playfulness yields solid results on songs like “Do It” ft. YG and Nipsey Hussle. It’s a return to the form of ratchet raps that both YG and Ty Dolla $ign helped establish in the West Coast alongside Mustard.
Meanwhile, Nipsey’s posthumous contributions, originally appearing on an unreleased Cardi B song titled “Wanna Know,” find an even better home over an eerily mesmerizing vocal loop. Unlike most posthumous features from Nipsey, “Do It” is a firm reminder of how adept he was at delivering stripper-friendly bops as much as lyrically-dense entrepreneurial gems. The addition of YG’s verse at the end, over a sample of Juvenile’s “Back That Azz Up,” is the icing top.

A Strong Return & A Step On The Right Path
Perhaps the only thing that warranted an ounce of excitement surrounding the initial announcement of Vultures was Ty Dolla $ign’s involvement. He and Kanye are polar opposites in many ways, primarily because Ty is as unproblematic as they come while the same can’t be said for Ye. However, they’ve established such a strong rapport over the years that it’s clear Ty Dolla $ign has put some sort of battery in Kanye’s back, one that allowed him to challenge himself beyond what his ego (and his yes men) tells him is genius.
Most importantly, Kanye sounds like there’s a sense of joy in making music on Vultures 1. The past few albums became vessels of communication for larger grievances; an unrelenting wielding of influence in the face of the most influential institutes, whether Adidas, Nike, Disney & Hulu, or the Kardashian clan at large. While that remains prevalent, like in “Burn” when he declares that he “burned 8 billion to take off my chains,” there’s a sense of vindication that comes with no restrictions or major label contracts to adhere to.
Vultures 1 pales in comparison to a discography built on pushing boundaries and shifting the culture. That even extends to the collaborative projects in Ye’s arsenal. However, while Jay-Z and Kid Cudi unlocked new levels out of Kanye on Watch The Throne and Kids See Ghosts, Ty Dolla $ign helped Kanye find a place of comfort amid the chaos that has trailed behind him over the past six years. It’s a new era in Kanye’s career, one that doesn’t veer too far from where he was in 2022. But with Ty Dolla $ign’s companionship, Kanye’s able to hone his focus to deliver an album that’s more worthy of listening to than debating.",2024-02-15T19:14:37Z,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com,HotNewHipHop
Kim Kardashian set to walk down the aisle for fourth time,"Kim Kardashian set to walk down the aisle for a forth time
Kim Kardashian is on the hunt for a new partner as she has decided to get married a fourth time amid her ex-husband Kanye West's whirlwind romance with his new wife Bianca Censori.
American Tv personality and Socialite Kim, 43, discussed the possibility of becoming a bride again in a new interview on SiriusXM’s This Life of Mine with James Corden.
Kim, who's currently dating football player Odell Beckham Jr., 31, said: ""I don't know. I really don't. There'll be moods where I'm just like, ""You know what? I understand my life is really big and I understand it takes a really, really, really special, unique person to want to deal with that.""
""I think my life is really fun and whoever comes in my life will have a really good time, but it's a lot.""
She tried to explain she's not in hurry to do it as she still has family and friends to keep her happy, but admitted that one needs a partner to enjoy the life with.
""I'm not lonely, so I'm good. I have my kids, I have work, I have my family, but it would be nice to share your life with someone, but when you do, it's such a big, I don't take that lightly,"" she added.
She also revealed what quality she wants in her next partner while responding to a question whether he could be famous, saying: ""No, I don't, but they would just have to really somehow understand what this life is.""
She went on expressing her desire about the characteristics her man needs to possess : ""Accountable for actions. Takes accountability. Good teeth. Can hold their own. I don’t have to babysit all the time. I mean, just a good genuine person that’s driven and has their own motivations in life to, the list is so long. I can’t. I’m tripping myself up trying to think of just four.""
However, she divulged the bitter truth about her romantic life, admitting: ""Totally. I'm the biggest hopeless romantic, but I do know the difference. I know what a real relationship is.""
Kim was previously married three times. Her most recent husband was Kanye West, 46, with whom she shares four kids: North, 10, Saint, eight, Chicago, six, and Psalm, four. The two were together from 2012 until 2021.
She was also married to basketball star Kris Humphries, 39, for a total of 72 days in 2011. Kim's first marriage was to music producer Damon Thomas, from 2000 until 2003. Her last relationship was with former SNL star Pete Davidson whom she dated from October 2021 until August 2022.

Kim Kardashian has reportedly expressed concerns over Bianca Censori's racy looks around her children.
As per Daily Mail, the reality TV star ""instructed"" her ex-husband Kanye West ""to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids.""
The source added, ""Kanye did the same thing he is doing with Bianca to Kim throughout their marriage.""
""The difference is that when Kanye dressed Kim, he was respected as a person – as an artist. Unfortunately, Kim knows what Bianca is going through – but she feels Bianca should have known what she was getting into,"" an insider further said.
For the unversed, the Skims founder was married to the rapper for ten years. However, the two parted ways in 2021.
Notably, the former couple co-parents their four kids, North, 10, Saint, 7, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4.
Soon after their high-profile divorce, Kanye reportedly tied the knot with the Australian beauty in 2022.
Since then, the musician has been making it to the negative headlines as he keeps creating explicit looks for Bianca.
Moreover, the Vultures maker often shares racy photos of his wife on social media.
Reacting to the criticism over Bianca's shared photos, Kanye recently said on Instagram, ""Ima post my wife as much as I want bro.""
""It makes me happy. Some people don’t want you to be happy. They want you to make them happy. I decided to make myself happy and I’m happy with that,"" he added.",2024-02-15T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign Will Bring ""Vultures"" To Rolling Loud California","Following the release of his eagerly-anticipated project with Ty Dolla Sign, Vultures 1, Kanye West has taken to Instagram to share some exciting news. According to the Yeezy founder, the duo will take the stage at Rolling Loud California on March 14, only days after the second installment of Vultures is scheduled to arrive. The festival's official Twitter account confirmed the news shortly after Ye's announcement.
Aside from Kanye and Ty Dolla Sign, attendees will also have the opportunity to catch sets from Nicki Minaj, Sexyy Red, YG & Tyga, and more. It goes without saying that they're looking forward to the performance, however, some have doubts that it'll actually happen. Famously, Ye canceled his headlining set at the festival back in 2022 only days before it was scheduled to take place.

Kanye West Shares Exciting News On IG
""Rolling loud? More like rolling the dice to see if you show up,"" one Instagram user writes under Ye's announcement. Another says, ""Bro’s gonna cancel his set the day before."" Either way, supporters are hopeful that this time around, the performance will go off without a hitch. After all, opportunities to see Ye perform Vultures material have been scarce, and mostly limited to lucky fans able to score pricey tickets to his last-minute listening parties.
Rolling Loud California may not be the only exciting show Ye has lined up, however. Earlier this month, he took to social media to reveal that he was having trouble getting venues to book him, largely due to his antisemitic and otherwise unsavory comments. Luckily, some of his well-connected friends were able to come through for him, and talk of a potential world tour has already begun. What do you think of Kanye West announcing that he and Ty Dolla Sign will be performing Vultures at Rolling Loud California? Are you looking forward to it?

Kanye West Gifts Bianca Censori Gorgeous Red Rose Bouquets For Valentine's Day,"Kanye West and Bianca Censori's relationship has been under a microscope ever since they got together. Now that they are married everything is magnified x200. Even his most die-hard fans and followers are certainly not too happy with Ye continuously posting Bianca. The reason for that is because it seems that every time he posts her on his pages, she is wearing something incredibly revealing. Many feel that Kanye is parading her around and publicly degrading her. However, people are still following the rap superstar anyway. That led to him calling out the complainers in a short video at an airport.
“Y’all, I just want to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose. So what I’m saying is, I delivered the album. And people still in my comments talking 'bout, 'Why you posting your wife?'"" Kanye goes on to explain, ""Cause she makes me happy. That’s why y’all happy with the music because I’m happy. You understand?""

"Kanye West Recruited Inter Milan Fans To Record Backup Vocals For ""Carnival""","Over the weekend, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign released their highly-anticipated new collaborative album VULTURES 1. The project was first announced a few months ago before facing numerous delays. Eventually, it was revealed that the album had become three albums that would be released across the next few months. Once the first volume finally arrived fans were delighted to find a feature-stacked tracklist sporting some of the biggest names in rap.
One of the standout songs on the record for many fans is ""Carnival."" In addition to West and Ty, the song also features appearances from Playboi Carti and Rich The Kid. It made waves before the album was even officially released following tweets made by Ozzy Osbourne. The legendary metal singer took issue with an uncleared sample of a Black Sabbath performance that West used during the listening party for the album. The sample was eventually replaced entirely on the officially released version of the song. But now fans are once again talking about the song after a new video emerged earlier this week.

Kanye West Clarifies Name-Dropping Taylor Swift on 'Vultures' Album,"Kanye West is trying to lead with love as he clarified that name-dropping Taylor Swift on Vultures 1 standout “Carnival” came with no ill will. “I mean since Taylor Swift, since I had the Rollie on the wrist/ I’m the new Jesus b—h, I turn water to Cris,” he raps on the anthem.
West posted a photo to Instagram on Wednesday (Feb. 14) screenshotting a fan’s tweet calling for Swifties to support Beyoncé’s pair of singles to help block Kanye from debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 with “Carnival.”
“WHEN I SAID THAT I’M THE NEW JESUS B—H I WASN’T EVEN THINKING ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT THAT WAS A WHOLE LINE BEFORE BUT I APPRECIATE THE FREE PROMO,” he wrote.
Trending on Billboard
The Chicago-bred rapper — who now goes by Ye — went on to explain that he actually had Swift’s back when Scooter Braun purchased the masters to the pop star’s first six albums through a 2019 deal. (West dissed Braun on “Vultures,” with the rapper claiming that he had been intimate with the record exec’s wife in one lyric.)
“REMEMBER I WAS ON TAYLOR’S SIDE WHEN SCOOTER BOUGHT HER MASTERS BEHIND HER BACK,” he continued in his post. “SHE AND BEYONCÉ ARE BIG INSPIRATIONS TO ALL MUSICIANS WE ALWAYS SAY HOW BOTH SELL OUT TOURS AND MOVIES.”
Ye believes he’s been more “helpful” to Swift’s massive career as a pop titan than “harmful,” but wouldn’t exactly call himself an ally to the Swifties.
“ALSO, I’M SURE I’VE BEEN FAR MORE HELPFUL TO TAYLOR SWIFT’S CAREER THAN HARMFUL,” he added. “TO ALL TAYLOR SWIFT FANS I AM NOT YOUR ENEMY UUUM IM NOT YOUR FRIEND EITHER THOUGH LOL.”
Ye and Swift have a complicated history, to say the least. Their relationship is famously headlined by the infamous 2009 MTV Video Music Awards moment when the rapper crashed the stage during Swift’s acceptance speech to highlight Beyoncé’s video. He also took credit for making her “famous” on a The Life of Pablo track in 2016.
In the same IG post, West reflected on the turbulence of the last year caused by his antics and antisemitic remarks, which saw just about every brand associated with the rapper sever ties.
“LAST YEAR WAS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING FOR ME, MY WIFE, MY CHILDREN, FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I’VE BEEN BANNED FROM HOTELS, KICKED OUT OF COMPANIES, AND EVEN NOT ALLOWED TO EAT IN SOME RESTAURANTS,” Ye penned. “EVERYONE SAW VULTURES 1 GET TAKEN OFF OF PLATFORMS TO LIMIT OUR FIRST WEEK NUMBERS. THIS REMINDS ME OF THE MISTREATMENT OF MY PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN.”
Even through all of the controversies, Yeezy is vying for what could be his 11th album earning the No. 1 spot atop the Billboard 200 after this week thanks to Vultures 1.

Kanye West's 'Vultures 1' Distributor Aims to Remove It From Streaming,"Shortly after releasing “Vultures 1,” his collaborative album with Ty Dolla Sign, Kanye West is potentially facing a rocky road in keeping the project on streaming services.
According to FUGA, which is listed as the distribution service in YouTube’s metadata for the album, West uploaded the album to DSPs on Saturday through its automated process after the company had previously declined to distribute the record. Now, as first reported by Billboard, FUGA claims to be working directly with streaming platforms to remove the album from their respective databases.
“Late last year, FUGA was presented with the opportunity to release Vultures 1. Exercising our judgment in the ordinary course of business, we declined to do so,” FUGA shared in a statement to Variety. “On Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement. Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.”
Last year, West had been shopping for potential distributors after years of releasing music while signed to Universal Music Group. Now an independent artist, he reportedly was denied distribution services from numerous companies due to his caustic antisemitic remarks. It’s unclear if that led to the album’s consistent delays, or if it was due to West’s proclivity to meticulously keep working on his music, often after it reaches the market.
Yesterday, fans noticed that one of the tracks, “Good (Don’t Die)” had already been removed from Spotify, though it remains on other streaming services including Apple Music and YouTube. The song, which interpolates Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love,” came under fire following the album’s release, with the late singer’s husband Bruce Sudano claiming that the estate denied its use.
“@kanyewest asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!” he wrote on social media.
Sudano isn’t the only one taking issue with West’s use of existing music for his own. Ozzy Osbourne also asserted on Friday that the rapper sampled a Black Sabbath song without his permission. “@kanyewest asked permission to sample a section of a 1983 live performance of ‘War Pig’ from the US festival without vocals & was refused permission because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many,” he wrote. “He went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night. I want no association with this man!”",2024-02-15T16:06:43Z,https://variety.com,Variety
Kanye West’s ‘Vultures 1’ Distributor Wants to Take It Down,"Last year, Kanye West started looking for a distribution deal to release a new album. When Vultures 1, a full-length collaboration with Ty Dolla $ign, finally came out on Saturday, it was through FUGA — a business-to-business tech and distribution platform for labels — according to information available in YouTube’s content management system.
FUGA was not pleased, according to a company spokesperson. “Late last year, FUGA was presented with the opportunity to release Vultures 1,” the spokesperson said in a statement to Billboard. “Exercising our judgment in the ordinary course of business, we declined to do so.”
The spokesperson continued, “on Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement. Therefore, FUGA is actively working with its DSP partners and the client to remove Vultures 1 from our systems.”
Trending on Billboard
A rep for West did not respond to a request for comment.
When West began hunting for a new distributor, some potential partners passed on the chance to work with him due to the rapper’s antisemitic comments. Others’ interest diminished when they found out that streaming services might not support the album.
The lead single from Vultures 1, “Vultures,” was distributed by Label Engine, a company owned by Create Music Group, according to information in YouTube’s CMS. The follow-up, “Talking/Once Again,” was also delivered last week by Label Engine. The album was subsequently delivered by FUGA.
FUGA’s plan to remove Vultures 1 from its platform is just the latest hiccup for the album. Its release was repeatedly delayed. After it came out, on Wednesday, the track “Good (Don’t Die)” was removed from Spotify after a complaint from Donna Summer’s estate.
“Kanye West… asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!” the estate wrote in an Instagram Story on the official Donna Summer account on Saturday.",2024-02-15T15:50:15Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Kanye West slams Taylor Swift fans plotting to ruin ‘Vultures 1’ debut,"How could they be so heartless?
Kanye “Ye” West fired back at Taylor Swift fans Wednesday claiming that they are purposefully attempting to deny his brand-new album “Vultures 1” the No. 1 slot on the Billboard charts after one fan declared a “Swiftie emergency” on X (formerly Twitter).
“SWIFTIE EMERGENCY,” read the tweet from the now-private account. “Beyonce’s new single ‘Texas Hold’em is challenging Kanye West for #1 debut on Billboard Hot 100.”

“Let’s buy and stream Texas Hold’em to block him from the top spot,” the die-hard fan continued. “Remember, he dragged Taylor on his latest Instagram story.”
West, 46, later posted a screenshot of the tweet on his Instagram, slamming the user.
“When I said that I’m the new Jesus b–ch I wasn’t even thinking about Taylor Swift,” West ranted on Instagram. “That was a whole line before but I appreciate the free promo.”
“Lil Wayne actually mentions Travis Kelce on ‘Vultures 2,'” continued the rapper, who claimed his brand-new music is actually “super positive and fun” as well as “triumphant.”
“Last year was incredibly challenging for me, my wife, my children, friends and family,” he went on, referring to the fallout after his antisemitic rants. “I’ve been banned from hotels, kicked out of companies, and even not allowed to eat in some restaurants.”

According to the “Donda” musician, he was on Swift’s side during her spat with her former manager Scooter Braun and even claimed that Swift, 34, and Beyonce, 42, served as musical inspirations.
“I’m sure I’ve been far more helpful to Taylor Swift’s career than harmful,” West proclaimed. “To all Taylor Swift fans, I am not your enemy uuum I’m not your friend either though lol.”
West then addressed the rumors that he and his wife, Bianca Censori, 29, were allegedly kicked out of a suite by Swift during the 2024 Super Bowl on Sunday.
“Also I didn’t get kicked out of the Super Bowl,” he alleged, saying that the pair actually left their seats to go visit other friends.

West’s Instagram message comes mere days after he name-dropped Swift in his new song, “Carnival.”
“Why she say she sucked my d–k / Then she say she ain’t sucked my d–k / She gon’ take it up the a– like a ventriloquist / I made six Taylor Swift since I had the Rollie on the wrist,” West raps.
The new mention of Swift instantly angered several social media users.
“Taylor Swift was his target twice and has successfully moved on from both events and thrived. Meanwhile, Kanye feels the need to name-drop her every time he needs clout and attention,” one user on X argued.
“Kanye West still unironically thinking he made Taylor Swift famous is so … like if you’re the one using her name in songs TWICE because you’re desperate for attention, I don’t think you’re as relevant as you think you are,” a second person slammed.
West’s bad blood with Swift began in 2009, when the performer infamously hopped onto the MTV Video Music Awards stage during her acceptance speech and declared that Beyoncé “had one of the best videos of all time.”

In 2016, he went on to mention Swift on his song “Famous.”
“I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous,” he sings.
West asserted that he didn’t mean to diss the “Blank Space” songstress, adding that he and Swift “had an hourlong convo with her about the line, and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.”
Swift refuted that assertion, saying that West didn’t tell her about the “I made that b—h famous” line.
Tensions between the two artists were further fueled when West’s then-wife, Kim Kardashian, posted what appeared to be the entire conversation on her Snapchat, which seemed to indicate that Swift was lying and had indeed given West permission.
“You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” Swift told Time magazine after being named 2023’s Person Of The Year. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before.”
5 According to the “Donda” singer, he was on Swift’s side during her spat with her former manager Scooter Braun and even quipped that Swift, 34, and Beyonce, 42, served as musical inspirations to him. Kanye West/Instagram
According to Swift, the incident was among the “horrendous things that happened” to her and called the experience “getting canceled within an inch of my life and sanity.”
The aftermath forced the “Karma” singer to move to “a foreign country,” where she “didn’t leave a rental house for a year.”
“I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore,” she revealed. “I went down really, really hard.”
In 2020, the real version of the call was leaked online by an unknown party and vindicated Swift.
Despite their yearslong feud — and both being in close proximity during the Super Bowl — Swift was all smiles as she and several friends attended the game at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. She ended the night be celebrating with her Kansas City Chiefs tight end boyfriend, Travis Kelce, who beat the San Francisco 49ers 25-22.",2024-02-15T14:45:17Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
Kanye West Claims He’s Been ‘More Helpful’ To Taylor Swift’s Career,"Kanye West clapped back at Swifties for trying to block him from a number-one debut on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in an Instagram post on Wednesday, February 14. The rapper, 46, claimed that he was “far more helpful” rather than “harmful” to Taylor Swift, 34, and her career in the long Instagram post. He claimed that his new album was “positive and fun” rather than hurtful.
Yeezy shared a screenshot of a post from a Taylor fan account, encouraging fans to stream and purchase Beyonce’s new song “Texas Hold ‘Em” to prevent Kanye from having a number-one debut with his new album Vultures 1. As Kanye took time to respond to the post, he appeared to extend an olive branch to Taylor, as he spoke about taking her side in her battle for her masters. “Remember I was on Taylor’s side when Scooter [Braun] bought her masters behind her back,” he wrote.
Kanye took time to show respect to Taylor and Beyonce for their success, even as he claimed that he was “helpful” to Taylor. “She and Beyonce are big inspirations to all musicians we always say how both sell out tours and movies. Also, I’m sure I’ve been far more helpful to Taylor’s career than harmful,” he wrote.
The rapper then turned his attention to the Swifties, with a bit of a backhanded way of saying that he wasn’t concerned with them. “To all Taylor Swift fans I am not your enemy,” Kanye wrote. “I’m not your friend either though lol.”
At the end of his post, Kanye also once again addressed a rumor that he was removed from the Super Bowl at Taylor’s request. His rep had already denied the rumor as “completely fabricated” in a statement. The “All of the Lights” rapper explained that he and his wife Bianca Censori had gone “to see different friends,” leaving their seats. “My wife had never been to a Super Bowl so I wanted to walk around and have a nice time,” he wrote. “We had such a fun day.”",2024-02-15T14:43:23Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife

La riña entre Kanye West y Taylor Swift lleva varios años vigente. Todo comenzó en aquella infame gala de los MTV Video Music Awards de 2009 donde una joven Taylor Swift subió a recibir su astronauta de plata en la categoría de Mejor Video del Año por su trabajo en You Belong With Me. Antes de poder pronunciar palabra, Kanye West apareció con micrófono en mano a decir que Beyoncé debía recibir el galardón por su video de Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).
La riña de Taylor Swift y Kanye West data de 2009, cuando el rapero interrumpió a la ganadora del VMA Music Awards para decirle que el galardón se lo merecía Beyoncé
La controversia se volvió mayor con el lanzamiento del tema Famous en 2016, donde Kanye West dice textualmente “Siento que Taylor y yo todavía podríamos tener sexo ¿Por qué? Yo hice famosa a esa perra”. Kim Kardashian, entonces esposa de West, editó un video donde Swift aprobaba las letras del rapero, aunque esto realmente jamás ocurrió.

Estas actitudes por parte de Kanye West han hecho que el enorme séquito de fanáticos de Taylor Swift sumen esfuerzos para entorpecer la carrera del músico en cada oportunidad que se presenta. Este 14 de febrero, West compartió la captura de pantalla de una fanática de Taylor que le pedía a la comunidad de X que se unieran para comprar y descargar el nuevo sencillo de Beyoncé TEXAS HOLD’ EM. Esto para evitar que Kanye West consiguiera el número 1 de la lista Billboard con el lanzamiento de su más reciente producción discográfica Vultures.

“Recuerden que yo estaba del lado de Taylor cuando Scooter (Braun) compró sus masters a sus espaldas.

Cabe recordar que en los últimos días corrió el rumor de que Taylor Swift había movido sus influencias para que sacaran del estadio a Kanye West y su esposa, Bianca Censori, del Allegiant Stadium, donde se estaba viviendo el Super Bowl LVIII. Esto a partir de que hubo varias tomas donde la pareja estaba en sus asientos y poco después desaparecieron. Al respecto, Kanye reveló lo siguiente:

Si bien, el mensaje de Kanye indicaría que busca un “acuerdo de paz” con Taylor Swift y sus fanáticos, no parece que la cantante esté dispuesta a perdonar muy pronto. El pasado diciembre, Swift fue nombrada Persona del Año por la revista TIME, para lo cual brindó una entrevista donde compartió la difícil situación que tuvo que atravesar después de que el tema Famous de Kanye West saliera a la luz.
“Tienes un montaje totalmente fabricado, en una llamada telefónica grabada ilegalmente, que Kim Kardashian editó y luego sacó para decir a todo el mundo que yo era una mentirosa. Eso me llevó psicológicamente a un lugar en el que nunca había estado. Me mudé a un país extranjero. No salí de una casa de alquiler durante un año. Me daba miedo hablar por teléfono.

Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign Track Taken Off Spotify After Donna Summer Estate Complaint,"Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign recently dropped off their new album Vultures 1. In fact, the album came out over the weekend and fans have been eager to give it more listens. Overall, the release was a bit confusing. It was dropped off on Apple Music and Amazon Music, but not Spotify. Eventually, the album came out on Spotify but there was a period where it had been taken off of Apple Music. This is the norm with a lot of Kanye releases, so fans were not all that surprised by the confusion.
Subsequently, the estate of Donna Summer spoke out about how the song ""I Feel Love"" was interpolated on ""Good (Don't Die)."" As the story goes, Kanye wanted to sample it but was denied permission. Consequently, Ye allegedly took matters into his own hands and used AI to get what he wanted. “Kanye West… asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!” the estate said.

Kanye West Speaks Out After Dissing Taylor Swift,"Kanye West has spoken out following his recent public diss of Taylor Swift.
The rapper, who goes by Ye, appeared to lash out at the singer on social media on Tuesday.
West shared a screenshot from The Daily Loud to his Instagram Stories. First posted to X, formerly Twitter, the post declared that West had overtaken Swift on Spotify's list of the most streamed artists globally.

The music legends were involved in a messy feud for over a decade, beginning with the rapper interrupting the pop star during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV VMAs.
However, the pair seemed to have buried the hatchet in recent years, until West's Instagram Story reignited feud rumors earlier this week.
The 46-year-old soared to the top of Spotify, following the release of his new album Vultures 1 with singer Ty Dollar Sign on Friday. As of Wednesday, the duo were still number one worldwide, with Swift in second place.
However, West wasn't the only icon to drop new music over the weekend. Beyoncé sent the Beyhive into a frenzy on Sunday, after teasing new tracks with her Verizon Super Bowl commercial.
The R&B singer later uploaded a teaser video to her Instagram account. Debuting her new song ""Texas Hold 'Em,"" the 42-year-old hummed the country tune while driving past a billboard of herself in Texas.
Unhappy with West's post about the pop star, one super fan urged fellow Swifties to buy and stream ""Texas Hold 'Em,"" to keep the rapper from reaching number one.
""Beyoncé new single 'Texas Hold 'Em' is challenging Kanye West for #1 debut on the Billboard Hot 100,"" user Adri (@souvlore) posted to X on Wednesday.
""Let's buy and stream Texas Hold 'Em to block him from the top spot!!! Remember, he just dragged Taylor on his latest Instagram Story.""
""Carnival,"" West's debut single from Vultures 1, isn't currently in the Billboard Top 100, although it is the most-streamed single on Spotify in the U.S. as of now. This is despite the album being removed from the platform on Wednesday following a legal dispute with the estate of late singer Donna Summer.
""Texas Hold 'Em"" is also yet to make the Billboard Top 100, but is currently in second place, just behind West, on the Spotify U.S. list.
West reposted Adri's tweet to his Instagram account, writing a lengthy reply in the caption.
""When I said that I'm the new Jesus b**** I wasn't even thinking about Taylor Swift,"" the Grammy winner said, referencing a line from ""Carnival.""
""This album is actually super positive and fun it's all about triumphant.""
West said the last year was ""incredibly challenging"" for him, his wife Bianca Censori, his four children—whom he shares with ex-wife Kim Kardashian—and his friends and family.
The Yeezy founder faced fierce backlash following antisemitic remarks he made in 2022. West apologized for his comments in December 2023 but had already lost a lucrative deal with Adidas, knocking him off Forbes' billionaire list and reducing his net worth to $400 million.
""I've been banned from hotels, kicked out of companies, and even not allowed to eat in some restaurants,"" he wrote on Instagram.
West also hit out at Spotify for removing Vultures 1, claiming it was an attempt to ""limit our first week numbers.""
The fashion mogul claimed that he supported Swift during her royalties battle with record executive Scooter Braun. The pop star was embroiled in a public feud with the record executive, after his company purchased her former record label Big Machine in 2019, giving him ownership of Swift's first six albums.

""She and Beyoncé are big inspirations to all musicians,"" West said. ""We always say how both sell out tours and movies.
""Also, I'm sure I've also been far more helpful to Swift's career than harmful.""
He told Swifties ""I am not your enemy,"" although he clarified that he is ""not [their] friend"" either.
West addressed rumors that he was thrown out of the Super Bowl on Sunday at Swift's request, explaining that he left his seat to go sit in rapper YG's box.
Concluding his post, West declared: ""The media may control the narrative, but the people have spoken.""
Many of West's 19.5 million Instagram followers praised his clapback, with DJ Diplo commenting: ""Damn that was a positive message.""
""The most misunderstood individual in media today,"" said Brock Jenkins.
""The media will misconstrue your words but your real fans will always stick by you,"" wrote Eli Feldman, while Mrumun Targuma said: ""They can't cancel you.""
However, other users slammed the post, with @mangomuggle calling the rapper's recent struggles ""Karma.""
Madison Hund agreed, writing: ""You're mad you can't go to restaurants or hotels... babes that's no one's fault but yours. your actions, your words. Don't try and blame swifties for things you said and did.""",2024-02-15T13:54:16Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
Kritiksnack: ”Kanye West har blivit rapmusikens Elon Musk”,"Du vet väl att du kan skapa ett gratiskonto på DN? Som inloggad kan du ta del av flera smarta funktioner.
Kajsa Haidl: Först bara, några spontana tankar om skivan?
Hasan Ramic: Jag gillade den! Det är inte banbrytande, även om man kanske förväntar sig det från honom. Den känns väldigt Kanye-esque – från det flippade i ”Paperwork” till det überpoppiga i ”Do it”, min favoritlåt för övrigt. Det är som ett kollage av sounds han redan har jobbat med de senaste tio åren. Det finns element från flera av hans skivor, såväl ”My beautiful dark twisted fantasy”, ”Yeezus” som ”808s & Heartbreak”. På det hela taget så känns det som ett rätt bra album från någon som har hållit på i tjugo år.
KH: Jag blev också positivt överraskad rent musikaliskt efter en första genomlyssning… och skämdes direkt för det.
Mattias Dahlström: Jag tycker att skivan förstärker hans både positiva och negativa sidor. Gedigen produktion med några höga toppar, medan en del verser känns… tveksamma.
KH: Vilka tänker du på?
MD: Textraden ”Keep a few jews on the staff now” är ju till exempel bland det första som möter en. Med Kanyes historia i åtanke så låter det som att han har anställt för att tysta kritiska röster för stunden, inte för att han faktiskt har lyssnat och tagit in kritiken. Man måste ha en närmast osannolik hybris om man går igenom en sådan kritikstorm och inte ägnar en sekund åt självrannsakan.
HR: Texterna är inte höjdpunkten här, nej. Man får skämmas om man gillar Kanye. Han är ju rappens Elon Musk vid det här laget. Ordet ”problematisk” räcker liksom inte till. Han är bara cringe nu. Människorna som okritiskt hejar på honom är lika cringe.
KH: Det är den ständiga outsiderrollen han gång på gång återvänder till. Det är destruktivt självskadebeteende. Jag känner plötsligt att han nu, för första gången, är på god väg att leva upp till rollen som det stora offer som han alltid själv har sett sig som.
MD: Jag har tänkt väldigt mycket på den där textraden på ”Back to me”, där han beskriver sig själv som hiphopnörd och jämför sig med Steve Urkel, alltså den nördiga karaktären från sitcomserien ”Räkna med bråk”. Det finns något i hur nörden på 90-talet sågs som en harmlös figur med specialintressen och sedan – boom – tog över världen. Ingen kunde förutse att nörden både skulle driva gamergate, näthata eller… bli Kanye.
KH: Du tänker på de kränkta incel-männen?
MD: Incels, eller bara genomsnittliga Marvelförsvarare, som rasar om någon petar i deras älskade berättelser från uppväxten. Steve Urkel hade en catchphrase som var ”Did I do that?”, som Kanye återanvänder. Skillnaden är väl att Urkel typ hade repat en bil, Kanye hyllar Hitler.
KH: Hela upptakten till albumsläppet är minst sagt… magstark. Det första, läckta albumomslaget som liknades vid det ökända black metal-bandet Burzum, hans uppträdanden i något slags svart Ku Klux Klan-mundering, listan fortsätter…
MD: Albumets nyckelmening är väl annars ”Who’s not entertained by my pain?”. Den har liksom hela Kanye: självpåtaget utanförskap, självömkan och analys av kändiskultur i ett.
KH: Skivan sågas ju i recensioner. Jag såg en rubrik svischa förbi: ”Att lyssna på Kanye West är att vada genom skitens skit”. Går det alls att recensera musiken utan att väga in vad man tycker om honom som person?
HR: Man kan inte förhålla sig till Kanye längre som enbart musiker. Jag tror inte att han vill det heller. Det är inte heller första gången han håller på såhär. Upptakten till 2016 års ”The life of Pablo” var lika kaotisk, med hela presidentkampanjen, det verkar vara en del av hans process nu. Men den där rubriken låter väldigt mycket som någon som inte har lyssnat på skivan eller bara bestämt sig för att det inte är bra.
MD: Samplingarna då? Du ville prata om dem, Kajsa?
KH: Jag har lagt till ”Good (don’t die)” i min egen spellista eftersom jag dels gillar hela All Saints ”The beach”-vibben och dels lösningen med den omgjorda ”I feel love”-samplingen. Så vitt jag förstår fick han nobben från Donna Summers dödsbo men hade redan gjort klart låten, inklusive titeln. Jag tycker att det är en rätt underbar lösning, där ”love” har bytts ut till ”good”. Det påminner om de mest skamlösa märkeskopiorna, de som stavar Tommy girl med ett m. Medvetet billig tounge-in-cheek-fejk. Förstår ni?
MD: Ja, exakt. Jag gillade också den lösningen.
HR: Vi måste prata lite Ty Dolla Sign också, för mig är hans närvaro helt avgörande här. Hans röst gör allting på skivan bättre, han är som aromatkrydda, som glutamat. Man känner för honom i allt det här. Hans insats är stor, han gör bra ifrån sig – och knappt någon ägnar honom en tanke.
MD: Han är väldigt mycket mer än ”Vultures” Andrew Ridgeley i alla fall. Nu pratar jag alltså om Wham-doldisen som helt försvann i George Michaels stjärnglans.
KH: Kärnfrågan då: har Kanye fortfarande DET?
HR: Han har DET men han är inte spjutspetsen längre. Han är en 40-nånting hiphopfarbror som har gjort mycket och nu bara kan återvinna sig själv.
MD: Det här rimmar givetvis inte med Kanyes självbild – men det hade kunnat vara en idé för honom att bara producera andra för en stund?
KH: Jag tycker den episka berättelsen om och runt Kanye, allkonstverket Kanye, i allra högsta grad har DET fortfarande. Dagens svar på Ikaros-myten?
HR: Skillnaden mellan Kanye och Ikaros är att Ikaros kraschade. Kanye bara fortsätter att flaxa på något mirakulöst sätt.
KH: En vild tanke då: det är som om åtminstone vissa av hans texter känns mer sanna för att de kommer från någon som slår i underläge den här gången, med tanke på alla brutna kontrakt och hur hela världen tycks ha tröttnat på honom.
HR: Men han är inte i underläge. Man ska komma ihåg att det är en enorm diskrepans mellan vad kritiker tycker och vad publiken tycker. De flesta, och då menar jag lyssnare, verkar bara tycka att det smäller.
MD: Lite som fotbolls-VM i Qatar.
Efter att samtalet hölls togs låten ”Good (don’t die)” bort från albumet på strömningstjänsterna.
Fakta. Kanye Wests ”Vultures 1” Den 10 februari släppte Kanye West sitt flera gånger uppskjutna ”Vultures 1”, där rapparen Ty Dolla Sign medverkar. Albumet släpptes på dagen 20 år efter Wests debutskiva ”The College Dropout” kom ut. ”Vultures 1” beskrivs som första delen i en trilogi, där del två och tre sägs släppas i vår. West, som numera kallar sig Ye, har flera gånger pekats ut för antisemitiska uttalanden. 2022 medverkade han i högernationalisten Alex Jones podcast och uttryckte sin beundran för Adolf Hitler. Detta ledde till att flera klädmärken avbröt sina samarbeten med artisten och han släpptes också av sitt skivbolag. I december bad West om ursäkt för tidigare antisemitiska uttalanden.

"Kanye West Reignited His Beef With Taylor Swift On ""Famous""","Kanye West had a lot of people stressed out as it pertains to the rollout for The Life Of Pablo. Overall, this was an album that went through a lot of changes. Even after its release, the project was continuously being tinkered with. From fixing mixes to adding features, TLOP acted as some sort of free-flowing art project. Although the reviews for the album were mixed at first, it seems like the album has aged extremely well. Sure, there are some questionable bars on it, but some of the production here can be classified as Ye's best.
During this era, Ye didn't really care whom he offended. You can say the same of his current mentality. However, this was really true with The Life Of Pablo. Yesterday, the album turned eight years old, and with Taylor Swift-Kanye conspiracies running rampant, we figured it would be appropriate to revisit ""Famous."" Fans know this as the song where Ye theorized about having sex with Taylor. This led to a huge firestorm that even involved a leaked phone call with Kim Kardashian. Whatever the case, this song remains memorable for both the lyrics, and the incredible Rihanna feature.

Kanye West Couldn't Help Himself
Like many of the tracks on The Life Of Pablo, this song is anthemic. It has phenomenal production while Ye sounds as confident as ever. On an album like Vultures, his lyrics have gone completely downhill. However, The Life Of Pablo and ""Famous"" in particular will have you yearning for a time when Ye still cared about having a personality. No matter what, you can't help but feel like TLOP is a moment in time we will unfortunately never get back.

Una funda dental de 800.000 euros: ¿qué son los ‘grillz’ y por qué lo lucen todas las estrellas?,"La escena tuvo lugar hace apenas una semana, pero ya parece que haya pasado un mundo. En la 66ª ceremonia de los premios Grammy, una pareja paseaba lo que entonces parecía felicidad absoluta, a la vez que ejemplificaba el momento de esplendor de la música latina. La argentina Nicki Nicole y el mexicano Peso Pluma eran una de las atracciones de la noche, la versión hispanohablante y perreofriendly de la gran pareja hollywoodiense. En las fotos de la velada, que pronto pasarán a formar parte de las galerías de lo que pudo ser y no fue, ambos artistas posan sonrientes. Ella, con una dentadura blanca inmaculada. Él, con una boca llena de oro.
Poco más de una semana después, esa pareja parece que ya no existe, pero las imágenes permanecerán para siempre. En ellas, como en muchas otras de esta época, quizás en unos años los observadores del futuro se preguntan por qué decidieron adornar sus dientes con oro, brillantes y otros materiales nobles que resplandecen con la luz. Los grillz, estas piezas de joyería pensadas para cubrir una o varias piezas dentales, han pasado de ser una opción estética de subculturas como el rap a ser una tendencia habitual en las estrellas del pop, que pagan por ellas cifras millonarias a la altura de sus patrimonios. El mes pasado varios medios estadounidenses cifraban en 850.000 dólares (más de 790.000 euros) los grillz de titanio que Kanye West lució en su cuenta de Instagram, basados en el villano Jaws de James Bond (visto en La espía que me amó o Moonraker). La buena noticia es que los modelos más básicos, para presupuestos alejados de las grandes fortunas de Hollywood, parten de los 150 euros que cuesta un aro de oro para un diente.

En los últimos años hemos visto con ellas a Dua Lipa, Bella Hadid, Justin Bieber, Beyoncé o Miley Cirus. Otras, como Rosalía, lo han adaptado a su imaginario personal, con piezas de brillantes con la forma de la mariposa del logo de Motomami. Ese hipotético espectador del futuro se preguntará varias cosas. Entre ellas, ¿por qué? ¿Por qué entonces? Y, sobre todo, ¿de dónde surge todo esto?
De etruscos a raperos
Adornar la boca con metales o piedras preciosas puede parecer algo innovador, una boutade propia de una época en la que las celebridades se ven obligadas a destacar en el maremagnum que es una alfombra roja multitudinaria o un feed de Instagram, pero es tan antiguo como el descubrimiento de los materiales preciosos y del consecuente deseo de remarcar un estatus social. La presencia de adornos dentales está documentada en distintos lugares del planeta y en épocas remotas. Se sabe que civilizaciones del sudeste asiático los utilizaban hace 4.000 años, gracias a vestigios encontrados en Filipinas. Se han documentado piezas similares en la civilización etrusca, y la cultura maya también ha dejado rastros de decoraciones bucales. Ya en el siglo XX, el uso de una funda de oro era síntoma, primero, de una economía más que saneada, como sustituto de un diente perdido, y más tarde, de un alarde un tanto obsceno que indicaba orígenes ajenos a la legalidad. Los lucían, por ejemplo, los capos de la mafia. Pero el auge reciente de las piezas de oro o brillantes en la dentadura tiene origen en otra cultura más reciente y que bebe, en parte, de la estética de esos mismos capos: la del hip hop.

No hay consenso para determinar quién fue el primer rapero en utilizar fundas doradas para sus dientes, pero Slick Rick fue el que comenzó a popularizarlo con su disco de debut en 1988. Ese momento iniciaba una época en la que el oro y los brillantes comenzaron a extenderse de cuellos, manos y orejas a la boca. La cultura hip hop, que abrazaba el lujo sin ambages, comenzó a hacer propia una práctica que había caído en desuso, y que se vinculaba más con la De paso, también le dio nombre, o más bien varios: conocidos como fronts, golds, o grillz, es esta última denominación la que ha pasado a infiltrarse en la cultura popular como símbolo de ostentación orgullosa, el equivalente callejero a llevar un Rolex en la muñeca.
En la popularización de este complemento hay un nombre clave. A principios de los ochenta un joven de origen Surinamés llamado Eddie Plain se propuso encontrar una manera de adornar los dientes sin reemplazarlos por piezas metálicas, tal y como se hacía entonces. Como se cuenta en el libro Mouth Full of Golds, de Amani Bin Shikhan, Plain quiso comenzar un negocio basado en la joyería aplicada a la dentadura sin dañarla y con la posibilidad de que no fuese permanente. Para ello, investigó las posibilidades de los moldes para crear piezas que cubriesen los dientes sin ser permanentes. El momento, con el auge de la cultura hip hop, fue perfecto para su negocio. Desde Brooklyn, donde su familia llegó a Estados Unidos, se trasladó a Atlanta, donde se convirtió en una institución en la escena del rap y creo diseños personalizados para aspirantes a estrellas y todo aquel que quería lucir estatus en su boca.
Cómo los grillz llegaron al mainstream
En 1992, Madonna estaba todavía en pleno apogeo de sus capacidades como estrella del pop y generadora de tendencias, la mayor parte de ellas adaptadas de las subculturas callejeras. En su reinvención visual para Erótica, disco acompañado de su polémico libro Sex, la cantante dio un paso estético que entonces parecía tremendamente arriesgado: un diente de oro. Con esa imagen se fotografió, grabó videoclips e incluso sufrió el roce pélvico de Millán Salcedo en una entrevista memorable. Lo que en ese momento pareció otra excentricidad de una estrella empeñada en epatar fue en realidad la puerta de entrada de una tendencia de la calle y el hip hop a la cultura del estrellato pop.

Se abrió así una brecha entre la subcultura y la cultura de masas. Mientras, en la cultura rap los grillz siguieron siendo una de las señas de identidad de los artistas del género, especialmente en el sur del país. Allí, en ciudades como Houston, surgieron figuras como la de Johnny Dang, un joyero de origen vietnamita que ha hecho fortuna creando diseños personalizados para artistas como Lil’ Wayne o Cardi B. El auge del trap, con unos cánones estéticos más arriesgados entre los que se incluyen los tatuajes faciales, reactivó el interés de la moda urbana por ellos.
El mundo del pop actual, en la eterna búsqueda de códigos callejeros que lo barnicen de autenticidad, ha ido progresivamente incorporando los grillz a su imaginario, primero como atrevimiento y luego como costumbre. En algún momento u otro lo han incorporado a su imagen estrellas como Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Dua Lipa o Beyoncé. Rosalía lo adoptó con la mariposa de Motomami como bandera, dándole una forma más sutil y asimilable. De ahí ha pasado a otras personalidades como Kim Kardashian, Bella Hadid, Kylie Jenner o deportistas como Lebron James. También se ha abierto paso como símbolo en películas como en la ganadora del Oscar Moonlight, de Barry Jenkins, como símbolo de poder o, desde otra perspectiva, del paso de la adolescencia a una edad adulta en la que la apariencia se impone a la inocencia.

Esa transición, la del lujo discreto al que se proclama sin vergüenza, es quizás la clave de su popularización: hacer que una boca brille es una declaración tan directa y ajena a la opinión de los demás que parece ideada para una época en la que lo que lo único que permanecerá, al menos durante algún tiempo, sean las imágenes.

Kanye West Faces Backlash Over Israel-Gaza Stance,"Kanye West's answer to a question about the conflict between Israel and Hamas has divided the internet.
The rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, was asked about his thoughts on the Palestinians while at an airport.
""I don't have enough information on that, I'm straight up,"" Ye said and repeated the n- word. ""I'm from the south side of Chicago, born in Atlanta. I don't have enough information, love for everybody but don't pull me into that conversation.""
Ye continued: ""I got people, I've got 14 kids dying every week in my city. So talk to me about that.""

“I got 14 kids dying every week in my city (Chicago) so talk to me about that”
pic.twitter.com/uSJJfba8QU — Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) February 13, 2024
The rapper was likely talking about Chicago where he spent most of his life but did not specify what the children were dying from. He was presumably referring to homicides, as the city has experienced a surge of violence in recent years.
Nearly 30,000 Palestinians have been killed by an Israeli military campaign in Gaza since October, according to the Associated Press. Israel started the ongoing attacks after Hamas launched a surprise offensive in the south of country which killed 1,200 people and left more than 200 as hostages, according to AP.
In the week prior to Ye's comments, Chicago recorded five homicides bringing the 2024 total to 39 per the Chicago Police Department's crime report.
In 2022, the most recent year for which figures are available, the main causes of death for the 599 children aged between one and 17 who died in the state of Illinois were accidents, homicide, cancer, suicide and congenital malformations. That equates to around 11 deaths per week in the entire state of which Chicago is the capital.

In that same year 175 children died in the city of Chicago itself, according to data from Illinois' Department of Public Health.
Footage of Ye's comments has been uploaded to X, formerly Twitter, triggering a mixed reaction.
""Not having enough information is a ridiculous excuse when we're 75 years in,"" said one person.
Another added: ""I think in order to be a celebrity, you have to be absolutely f***** stupid.""
But some had a different take.
""That's a good answer, really. Americans really need to focus on what's happening in [America],"" one person said.
A second person wrote: ""That's a damn good answer, really. Kids dying in his city he finds more relevant than what's going on over there. Good response IMO.""
Ye was likely not keen to wade into a debate about Israel after he was dropped by Adidas, who he worked with for his Yeezy streetwear line, over antisemitic comments he made on X and other platforms in 2022. Forbes valued his Yeezy deal at $1.5 billion and his fortune dropped to $400 million after it ended.
After spending months doubling down on his offensive comments, Ye apologized to Jewish people on his Instagram page in December.
He wrote to his 18.2 million followers: ""I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community ... It was not my intention to hurt or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused. I am committed to starting with myself and learning from this experience to ensure greater sensitivity and understanding in the future. Your forgiveness is important to me, and I am committed to making amends and promoting unity.""",2024-02-15T12:03:37Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
Kanye West claims he's been 'more helpful' to Taylor Swift's career than 'harmful',"Kanye West has professed that he’s been “more helpful” to Taylor Swift’s career “than harmful”.
After it was claimed the ‘Cruel Summer’ hitmaker, 34, allegedly had the controversial rapper thrown out of the Super Bowl VIII in Las Vegas last Sunday (11.02.24), the ‘Good Morning’ star has denied this to be true and insisted he and his wife, Bianca Censori, 29, simply went to a different part of the Allegiant Stadium to catch up with their friends.
The 46-year-old music star - who has feuded with the pop superstar in the past - reflected on being cancelled and dropped from brand deals after he made a series of antisemitic remarks.
He wrote in a lengthy Instagram post: “Last year was incredibly challenging for me, my wife, my children, friends and family
“I’ve been banned from hotels, kicked out of companies, and even not allowed to eat in some restaurants.”
He then turned his attention to the Super Bowl and claimed he was on Taylor’s “side” when she got into a row with Scooter Braun over the rights to her masters.
He went on: “Remember I was on Taylor’s side when Scooter bought her masters behind her back
“She and Beyoncé are big inspirations to all musicians we always say how both sell out tours and movies.
“Also, I’m sure I’ve been far more helpful to Taylor Swift’s career than harmful,
“To all Taylor Swift fans I am not your enemy uuum im not your friend either though lol (sic)“
He added: “Also I didn’t get kicked out of the Super Bowl. We left our seats to go to YG’s box and see different friends.
My wife had never been to a Super Bowl so I wanted to walk around and have a nice time we had such a fun day.”
Former NFL player Brandon Marshall made the claim on February 12, on his ‘Paper Route” podcast.
He said: “So Kanye West pulls up to the Super Bowl. Kanye West buys a ticket right in front of Katy Perry’s booth, so any time they are gonna be showing Katy Perry, Kanye’s face was going to be there - he had a mask on with his logo on the mask.
He then clarified that he meant Taylor, adding: “So Taylor Swift gets [annoyed] and she makes a call or two - everybody is involved - [and] he gets kicked out the stadium.”

"Kanye West responde a las 'swifties': ""He ayudado más que perjudicado a Taylor Swift""","La historia de animadversión y desencuentros entre Kanye West y Taylor Swift se remonta casi a los comienzos de la carrera de esta última, cuando Ye subió al escenario mientras Swift recogía un premio para decir que no era la merecedora de dicho galardón. Aquel gesto, más todas las polémicas que posteriormente ha protagonizado, hacen que los y las swifties no soporten demasiado al rapero de 46 años.
Pero, según Kanye, han llegado demasiado lejos con su último intento de 'cancelarle'. Una cuenta swiftie de una joven española se hacía viral después de escribir un tuit ""de emergencia"" pidiendo al resto de seguidores de Taylor que compren y escuchen la nueva música de estilo country que ha hecho Beyoncé para impedir que sea Kanye quien obtenga el número 1 en la lista de los Billboard Hot 100.
La joven ha tenido que hacer privada su cuenta porque, lo que no esperaba, es que Kanye utilizase su Instagram para contestarle a ella, enviando a responderle a sus millones de followers. Aparte de que ha vuelto a dar su versión de los hechos, los cuales ya resumió en uno de sus versos más recordados —y odiados por los fans de Taylor Swift—: ""Hice famosa a esa perra"".
Kanye comienza diciendo que, aunque muchos pensaran que se mofó de la autora de éxitos como Anti-Hero en una de sus últimas stories, él ""ni siquiera estaba pensando"" en ella, pero que agradece ""la promoción gratuita"" de su nuevo álbum, Vultures, que define como ""superpositivo y divertido"".
A continuación, Kanye afirma que el año pasado fue ""un increíble desafío"" para él y para su ""esposa, hijos, familiares y amigos"". ""Me han prohibido entrar a hoteles, me han echado de empresas, no me permiten comer en ciertos restaurantes"", enumera, añadiendo que están quitando su nuevo trabajo de algunas plataformas para ""limitar sus números"".
Kanye asemeja todo esto, lo cual proviene de sus comentarios y controversias antisemitas, racistas y misóginas de hace año y medio, con ""el maltrato por el color de piel"" de su gente. Y a partir de ahí hace una disertación sobre Taylor Swift, comenzando por recordar que él se puso de su lado ""cuando Scooter [Braun] compró sus masters a sus espaldas"".
""Ella y Beyoncé son grandes inspiraciones para todos los músicos, siempre se habla de cómo ambas agotan entradas en giras y cines. Además, estoy seguro de que he sido más útil que perjudicial para la carreta de Taylor"", sentencia.
""A todos los fans de Taylor: no soy su enemigo...

Kanye West insisted that he’s not Taylor Swift fan’s enemy or their friend.
Taking to Instagram Wednesday night, the “Jesus Walks” rapper responded to a “Swiftie Emergency” that saw the 14-time Grammy winner’s fans calling on everyone to stream Beyoncé’s new track “Texas Hold Em” in a bid to block West from reaching the top spot on the charts.
The rapper claimed that he’s been “far more helpful to Taylor Swift’s career than harmful.”

“When I said that I’m the new Jesus bitch I wasn’t even thinking about Taylor Swift,” he wrote in all-caps alongside a screenshot of a Swiftie tweet.
“Last year was incredibly challenging for me, my wife, my children, friends and family,” he went on, referring to the consequences he faced after posting anti-Semitic rants. “I’ve been banned from hotels, kicked out of companies, and even not allowed to eat in some restaurants.”
The father of four then reminded fans that he “was on Taylor’s side” when Scooter Braun bought her masters behind her back.
“She and Beyoncé are big inspirations to all musicians we always say how both sell out tours and movies,” he went on. Also, I’m sure I’ve been far more helpful to Taylor Swift’s career than harmful.”
“To all Taylor Swift fans I am not your enemy uuum im not your friend either though lol,” he said.
West then refuted claims that Swift had him and his wife, Bianca Censori, removed from Super Bowl after the rapper allegedly purchased seats right in front of her star-studded suite.

“Also I didn’t get kicked out of the super bowl we left our seats to go to YG’s box and see different friends,” he claimed.
“My wife had never been to a super bowl so I wanted to walk around and have a nice time we had such a fun day.”
West and wife Bianca Censori were photographed at the game, as well as shown in the stands during the CBS broadcast.

West was seen wearing a head-turning crucifix mask atop a full head covering at the big game, while Censori, 29, also donned a black latex balaclava.
Photos from the game showed West standing next to what appeared to be a security guard nowhere near Swift’s star-studded suite.
West’s beef with Swift goes back to 2009 when he interrupted her acceptance speech at the VMAs.

The pair’s bad blood reached its peak in 2016 when the “Gold Digger” rapper named her in his song “Famous.”
“I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex Why? I made that bitch famous,” he spit on the controversial tune.

Swift claimed she never permitted West to use her name on the track, prompting his then-wife, Kim Kardashian, to release a phone call proving the pop star did give Ye the go-ahead.
It was later proven that the recorded conversation was edited.
After a year of hiding, Swift eventually emerged back into the public eye with her sixth studio album, “Reputation.”",2024-02-15T08:55:44Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six
"Kanye West’s New Album Disappears From iTunes, Apple Music: Here’s Why","Topline
Kanye West’s latest album, “Vultures 1,” disappeared from Apple Music and iTunes Thursday afternoon after distribution company FUGA told Billboard it would work to remove the album, which was released by a FUGA client on Saturday despite the company previously declining to release it.

Key Facts
“Vultures 1,” Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s collaborative album which dropped Saturday, was taken off of iTunes and Apple Music Thursday afternoon, where it had previously been dominating the streaming and sales charts. Music distribution company FUGA told Billboard Thursday it was working to remove “Vultures 1” from its systems because a longstanding FUGA client released the album through the platform’s automated processes, “violating our service agreement.” FUGA had already declined to release “Vultures 1” late last year, a spokesperson told Billboard. Music distributors are typically able to remove content uploaded through their systems if they choose, Billboard reported. West had shopped “Vultures 1” around to multiple music distributors last year, some of whom declined to release the album because of West’s history of antisemitic comments, Billboard reported. Forbes has reached out to FUGA for comment.
Key Background
West had already faced criticism and threats of legal action against “Vultures 1” because of allegations that he sampled songs from multiple artists without permission. The track “Good (Don’t Die)” was removed from Spotify on Wednesday after Donna Summer’s estate accused him of “copyright infringement” by sampling her 1977 track, “I Feel Love,” after being denied permission. Similarly, Ozzy Osbourne tweeted on Feb. 9 that West had used a sample of his 1983 performance of “Iron Man” in his new track, “Carnival,” after being denied permission. Osbourne—who said he denied West the sample because of his history of antisemitism—reportedly threatened legal action, and the track was reportedly released without the sample.
What To Watch For
Whether the album will disappear from Spotify and other music platforms—and if it will eventually reappear. West would likely need to find a new distributor if he cannot resolve the situation with FUGA, Rolling Stone reported.
Surprising Fact
West had already accused streaming platforms of removing his music to “limit our first week numbers” in an Instagram post on Wednesday.

Kanye, 46, shared the tweet that encouraged Taylor fans to purchase and stream Beyonce's newest single, Texas Hold 'Em, so it blocks the Yeezy mogul from the #1 spot.
In his caption, Kanye said, ""WHEN I SAID THAT I’M THE NEW JESUS BITCH I WASN’T EVEN THINKING ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT. THAT WAS A WHOLE LINE BEFORE BUT I APPRECIATE THE FREE PROMO.
""LIL WAYNE ACTUALLY MENTIONS TRAVIS [KELCE] ON VULTURES 2. THIS ALBUM IS ACTUALLY SUPER POSITIVE AND FUN IT’S ALL ABOUT TRIUMPHANT.
""LAST YEAR WAS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING FOR ME, MY WIFE, MY CHILDREN, FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I’VE BEEN BANNED FROM HOTELS, KICKED OUT OF COMPANIES, AND EVEN NOT ALLOWED TO EAT IN SOME RESTAURANTS.
""EVERYONE SAW VULTURES 1 GET TAKEN OFF OF PLATFORMS TO LIMIT OUR FIRST WEEK NUMBERS. THIS REMINDS ME OF THE MISTREATMENT OF MY PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN,"" he wrote.
Kanye claimed that he was on Taylor's side when Scooter Braun purchased her masters and that she and Beyonce are ""big inspirations"" to artists.
The Flashing Lights rapper continued, ""I’M SURE I’VE BEEN FAR MORE HELPFUL TO TAYLOR SWIFT’S CAREER THAN HARMFUL. TO ALL TAYLOR SWIFT FANS I AM NOT YOUR ENEMY UUUM IM NOT YOUR FRIEND EITHER THOUGH LOL.
Kanye then denied claims that Taylor ""made calls for him to be removed"" from the Super Bowl.
""I DIDN’T GET KICKED OUT OF THE SUPER BOWL WE LEFT OUR SEATS TO GO TO YG’S BOX AND SEE DIFFERENT FRIENDS. MY WIFE HAD NEVER BEEN TO A SUPER BOWL SO I WANTED TO WALK AROUND AND HAVE A NICE TIME WE HAD SUCH A FUN DAY,"" he said.
He finished his rant with, ""THE MEDIA MAY CONTROL THE NARRATIVE BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN.""
On Tuesday, Kanye shared a tweet on his Instagram Stories that discussed the rapper dethroning Taylor as the top artist globally on Spotify.
TAYLOR IN KANYE'S MUSIC
In June 2016, Kanye released the controversial music video for his song Famous that featured naked lookalikes of A-list celebrities - including Taylor.
In the song, Kanye says, ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b***h famous / I made that b***h famous.""
Taylor Swift 'removed Kanye West from Super Bowl seat after rapper bought tickets in front of pop stars suite'
In Kanye's latest music project with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 1, Kanye mentions the Shake It Off hitmaker in his song, CARNIVAL.
The lyric reads, ""I made six Taylor Swift / since I had the new Rollie on the wrist / I'm the new Jesus b***h / I turn water into Crist.""
WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
The show-stopping moment that started it all occurred when a young Taylor was awarded the VMA for Best Female Video for ""You Belong with Me"" in 2009.
West climbed the stairs to interrupt Swift's acceptance speech with the now-infamous proclamation: ""Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'ma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!""
Shortly after, a stunned Taylor told reporters, ""I was standing on stage and I was really excited because I'd just won the award and then I was really excited because Kanye West was on stage … And then I wasn't excited anymore after that.""
TAYLOR SPEAKS OUT
In 2016, the stars' feud hit an all-time high due to the phone call between Kanye and Taylor about the lyrics in Famous that referenced her.
Taylor claimed that she wasn't aware that he calls her 'that b***h,' despite Kanye's wife at the time, Kim Kardashian, 43, stating otherwise.
Last December, Taylor was named Time's Person of the Year.
In her interview, Taylor slammed Kim or ""taking her down psychologically"" and ""forcing her into hiding"" for a year during their long-running dispute.
She claimed that the public fallout felt like ""a career death,"" saying: ""Make no mistake — my career was taken away from me.""
Taylor explained: ""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar.
""That took me down psychologically to a place I've never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn't leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls.""
She continued: ""I pushed away most people in my life because I didn't trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.""
Taylor's next 2017 album Reputation was said to be largely focused on her experience with the incident.
The songwriter's choice to use snake imagery in the album was claimed to be a veiled reference to Kim, which reignited the war between the celebrities and their fandoms.
""I thought that moment of backlash was going to define me negatively for the rest of my life,"" she noted.
Taylor also spoke about how a life of fame can be fickle, adding: ""Nothing is permanent. So I'm very careful to be grateful every second that I get to be doing this at this level, because I've had it taken away from me before.
""There is one thing I've learned: My response to anything that happens, good or bad, is to keep making things. Keep making art.
""But I've also learned there's no point in actively trying to quote unquote defeat your enemies. Trash takes itself out every single time.""

Old pictures of Kanye West playing basketball in East Victoria Park back in spotlight as TikToker mocks him,"Viral photos of Kanye West hitting up a Perth basketball court with his mates are back in the spotlight after TikTok content creators mocked his “manboobs”.
On September 5, 2014, the US rapper and his tour entourage were snapped playing ball at the Leisurelife Centre in Vic Park ahead of his Aussie tour which kicked off in Perth that day.
The now 46-year-old worked up a sweat as a group of elderly ladies lifted kettlebells nearby, oblivious to his presence.
West — dressed similarly to his entourage in black shorts and a white T-shirt—played for 30 minutes along with his support act, Pusha T.
Despite the images being a decade old, they reappeared on social media when TikTok account The MacPack Podcast — run by three Perth brothers — on Wednesday unpacked the funny moment.
“So it’s him playing with like his crew and whatever and now swipe to next photo there was also elderly people doing aerobics or some s..t on the court,” one brother said.
“I was more looking at his breasts,” another said.
The video, which has been watched more than 100,000 times, proceeds to zoom up close on West’s chest.
“That man needs a brassiere my goodness he got quite the bosom.”
The video finishes with the boys laughing at how the photo with the old people “is so funny” and “looks photoshopped”.

The podcast TikTok account is run by Jake, Joe and Riley McKenna who release weekly videos where they “discuss some humorous life stories, weekly antics and debate some of the more insignificant topics life throws our way”.
West arrived in WA on September 4 that year, with his wife (at the time, Kim Kardashian) also arriving ahead of his highly anticipated Yeezus tour, which kicked off at RAC Arena the following night.

West was originally supposed to perform in Australia in May of that year but postponed the tour so he could marry Kardashian in an elaborate ceremony in Italy.
Fast forward a few years and the pair ended their marriage in 2021 — but not before welcoming four kids together: North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4.

Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign's 'Vultures' Song Taken Off Spotify,"Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign aren’t feeling the Valentine’s Day love as their Vultures 1 track “Good (Don’t Die)” has been removed from Spotify after less than four days on the streaming service.
“Good (Don’t Die)” was taken down from Spotify on Wednesday afternoon (Feb. 14) but remains available on other streamers such as Apple Music. The electro-pop deep cut appears to interpolate elements of Donna Summer‘s 1977 hit “I Feel Love” on the pensive chorus.
Hours after Vultures landed on streamers over the weekend, Donna Summer’s estate claimed “copyright infringement” and disapproved of Kanye’s use of the alleged sample.
Trending on Billboard
“Kanye West… asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!” the estate wrote in an Instagram Story on the official Donna Summer account Saturday (Feb. 10).
“I Feel Love” reached a peak of No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977 and spent 23 weeks total on the chart. The track is one of 14 songs to reach the top 10 on the Hot 100 in Summer’s lifetime.
“Good (Don’t Die)” was far from the only sampling issues Kanye and Ty faced with Vultures 1.
A track tentatively titled “Everybody” was played at the New York Vultures listening event which appeared to sample the Backstreet Boys anthem of the same name, but was reportedly not cleared and didn’t make the first volume of Vultures on streaming.
Rockstar Ozzy Osbourne called out Kanye West and labeled him an “antisemite” after a former version of “Carnival” featured a live performance of Black Sabbath’s “Iron Man.” West went back to the drawing board and swapped out “Iron Man” for an interpolation of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy‘s “Hell of a Life” on the final version.
“We get so many requests for these songs,” Sharon Osbourne told Billboard last week. “And when we saw that request, we just said no way… We’ve been in touch with his team … And it’s also an issue of having respect for another artist.”

Every big brand fights to grab a position for their ad during the Super Bowl. This year too, the same fashion followed with brands like DoorDash, and DunKings going all out for their commercials. However, Kanye West, now who insists on being called, “Ye” broke all rules when it came to Super Bowl commercials.
America’s Favorite Video Today
At the Super Bowl LVIII, Ye released a commercial urging folks to buy products from his line of Yeezys. However, amidst all the glitz and glamour of the NFL’s biggest night, his commercial emerged from mere simplicity. The short video has gotten everyone talking. Most concur with one point: only Kanye could do something like this commercial and get away with it, also making the desired impact. One among these voices is former British fighter, Tony Bellew.
They just don’t make em like Kanye West anymore!

Filmed entirely on his iPhone, the 30-second video is a true masterpiece from the pop-culture icon. Cruising in the backseat of his car, West delivered a crisp and impactful message to the audience. In the dark, he noted, “Hey y’all, this is Ye, and this is my commercial,” he stated, beginning his piece. He then went on to add, “And since we spent all the money on the commercial spot, we actually – we didn’t spend any money on the actual commercial. But the idea is I want you to go to Yeezy.com… and I got some shoes and that’s it.”
While most people remained in awe of how simple his means was to reach his target group, the other bunch remained concerned if the efforts went in vain. However, his efforts hit the bullseye. The brand was on its plummet in the wake of his antics and his divorce from Kim Kardashian. However, as per reports, this commercial got him a staggering $19.3 million in sales. Yeezy.com saw a total of 294,357 orders from the spot.
Impressed with how Ye handled this significant 30 seconds of the Super Bowl that cost him about $7 million, Bellew, who retired from the sport in 2018, jotted on his X, “I swear this fella is something else! 7 million on a 30 second commercial at the superbowl and he only does it off his phone!…They just don’t make em like Kanye West anymore! I must also say this, His trainers are the best.”

His Super Bowl campaign was successful. To TMZ, Ye explained the significance of it all. He remarked, “I’ma just be honest with y’all: I was two months from going bankrupt and I put everything I had into it and we moved to Italy.” West revealed, “We moved to the factories and we survived. We survived through the cancellation. We back No. 1.”

Kanye West's album 'Vultures 1' pulled from Apple music over copyright concerns,"Kanye West's highly anticipated album, Vultures 1, faced a sudden removal from Apple Music and iTunes just five days after its debut on the platform.
The move came amidst copyright infringement issues plaguing the album, which Kanye's daughter North had previously showcased in a now-deleted TikTok post.
The album's removal from Apple Music occurred on Thursday afternoon, with the song Carnival having previously held the No. 1 slot on the Top 100: Global chart.
Reports surfaced suggesting that the distributor of album is actively working to eradicate it from all streaming services, following allegations that he uploaded it without proper permission.
According to Billboard, the album encountered streaming issues earlier in the week when Spotify removed the track Good (Don't Die) due to claims of copyright infringement made by Donna Summer’s estate.
FUGA, the distributor, released a statement addressing the matter, stating, ""On Friday, February 9, 2024, a long-standing FUGA client delivered the album Vultures 1 through the platform’s automated processes, violating our service agreement.""
As a result, FUGA is collaborating with its Digital Service Provider (DSP) partners and the client to ensure the removal of album from their systems.
While the album remains accessible on Spotify for now, the track Good (Don’t Die) is currently unplayable on the platform.
The Rolling Loud music festival made headlines by announcing Kanye and his collaborator Ty Dolla Sign as the headliners for their upcoming concert on March 14 in Inglewood, CA.
However, this exciting news was swiftly overshadowed by accusations from Donna Summer's estate, alleging Kanye's unauthorized use of a sample from her song I Feel Love.
The late singer's official Instagram page shared a post claiming that he had previously requested permission to use I Feel Love, only to be denied.
Despite the rejection, he purportedly incorporated a version of the iconic song into his track, prompting allegations of copyright infringement.

Reason behind Kanye West posting Bianca Censori's explicit images explained,"Reason behind Kanye West posting Bianca Censori's expletive images explained
Kanye West has been in the news lately, not for his music, but rather for sharing derogatory photos of his wife Bianca Censori on social media.
According to an expert, the controversial rapper Ye, who now goes by Ye, flaunts the Yeezy designer's almost-naked photos to pique the jealousy of other men.
A body language expert concluded that the rapper is insecure and seeks validation based on his pattern of sharing photos and his recent outbursts.
Even though Kanye uses his wife's photos to show off her body, he frequently receives harsh criticism from users on social media, which he views as ""demeaning.""
Speaking with The Sun, Judi James said, “Kanye set out to create a mean and moody message to his critics.”
“He has wanted to enjoy this sense of a beautiful trophy wife, that will make other men envy him and what he has,” the expert added.
She continued: “But when he posts Bianca’s nearly nude poses and gets negative comments, he finds it demeaning. This is why he used terms like Superhero and King to describe himself.”
“Ironically, Bianca has fast become his Achilles' heel regarding the rising criticism he now responds to. We can see in the airport rant that Kanye feels insecure.”",2024-02-14T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Kanye & Ty Dolla's 'Vultures' and Usher's 'Coming Home' Race for No. 1,"The Contenders is a midweek column that looks at artists aiming for the top of the Billboard charts, and the strategies behind their efforts. This week (for the upcoming Billboard 200 albums chart dated Feb. 24), two of the year’s most-anticipated new releases vie for No. 1, while a third-party candidate originally from 2022 also gets into the mix.
Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures 1 (YZY): Kanye’s and Ty Dolla’s long-awaited and much-delayed – can just assume both of those descriptors with any Ye-related release at this point – collaborative new LP Vultures 1 is the former’s first wide release on his new independent label YZY. The 16-track effort features appearances from big-name collaborators like Travis Scott, Playboi Carti and Chris Brown – though none are actually credited on the feature-less tracklist – as well as a guest vocal from Ye’s 10-year-old daughter North on “Talking.” (It also features an interpolation of Donna Summer’s disco classic “I Feel Love” on “Good (Don’t Die),” which the Summer estate has decried as unauthorized.)
The album was originally supposed to debut on Friday, after a Chicago listening event, but ultimately trickled out (with a false start or two) on streaming services over Saturday. The incomplete first tracking week for the set – with only five full days of consumption – will likely dampen its opening numbers a little, as will its lack of physical availability, as the album is not yet available for purchase on CD or vinyl. (The set also has received muted support on many top Spotify playlists for an album of its buzz, likely due to past and ongoing Ye-related controversies.)
Trending on Billboard
However, with high anticipation for the set (as Ye always seems to garner, regardless of his real-life backlash), it should still do fairly sizeable streaming numbers. As of Wednesday, it still claimed four songs in the top 10 on Spotify’s US Daily Top 200 and five in Apple Music’s real-time top 10, with its “Carnival” leading both listings. Given Kanye’s history on the Billboard 200 – which boasts 10 No. 1 albums, including controversy-embroiled more recent releases like 2019’s JESUS IS KING and 2021’s Donda – it would be foolish to bet against him finding similar success with Vultures.
Usher, Coming Home (Mega/Gamma): Coming Home represents a number of firsts for Usher: His first album of the 2020s, his first through independent record label Mega (in partnership with the Larry Jackson-founded alternative distributor Gamma) and his first since being minted as a Super Bowl headliner. Technically, the set debuted two days before the Big Game, but the album will undoubtedly be boosted by the added exposure of the most-watched halftime performance in SB history – even though the pop&B superstar didn’t actually perform any songs from the new album, opting to stick to a set of more-established classics.
Nonetheless, Coming Home does arrive with some built-in success: “Good Good,” the album’s lead single alongside next-gen ATLiens Summer Walker and 21 Savage, has previously reached No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100, already his biggest hit on the chart in a decade. The set features additional collabs with hitmakers Latto, Burna Boy, H.E.R. and Jung Kook (on a previously released remix of the latter’s top 5 Hot 100 hit “Standing Next to You”). All of these should help streams of the set — and sales are also expected to be robust, with Coming Home available on CD, in five different vinyl variants, and through both CD and vinyl box sets that include branded merch. (Digital editions of the album have also been heavily discounted.)
While Usher’s new album will likely be his best-performing LP this week, he should also see some major movement with his back catalog – most notably with his Billboard 200-topping 2004 juggernaut Confessions. The classic album, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, had a whopping seven tracks make its way to Usher’s halftime setlist, including the set-capping Lil Jon and Ludacris collab “Yeah!” and the much-buzzed-about Alicia Keys duet performance “My Boo.” It re-enters the top half of the 200 this week, jumping 140-92, and should make an even bigger leap next week.
Noah Kahan, Stick Season (Mercury/Republic): The weather may be warming outside – slowly – but on the Billboard 200, Stick Season may simply never end. Alt-folk singer-songwriter Noah Kahan’s breakout album, which has only grown in popularity and impact in the 16 months since its October 2022 release, has spent the entirety of post-holidays 2024 in the Billboard 200’s top 10, climbing back as high as No. 4, after having peaked at No. 3 last June following the set’s We’ll All Be Here Forever deluxe re-release.
Stick Season slips to No. 7 this week, but it may very well return to the top three once more next week, following another, even deluxer reissue of the set. This one is titled Stick Season (Forever), and features a whopping 30 tracks, including previously released Hot 100-charting collaborative remixes of Stick originals with Post Malone (“Dial Drunk”), Kacey Musgraves (“She Calls Me Back”) and Hozier (“Northern Attitude”). In addition to all of those, the set also boasts two (well, one and a half) totally unreleased cuts: the solo ballad “Forever” and the Brandi Carlile-guesting redo of We’ll All Be Here Forever fan favorite “You’re Gonna Go Far.” (All versions of the album, new and old, are combined together for tracking and charting purposes, under its original title: Stick Season.)
The new edition of the now-blockbuster set has no physical release available, but has already spurred plenty of extra streaming activity for both the original album and its previously released “new” tracks – as well as for the brand-new “Forever,” which is still in the top 50 on both Spotify and Apple Music’s daily charts.",2024-02-14T18:12:01Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

Kanye West denies rumor Taylor Swift had him thrown out of Super Bowl,"Originally appeared on E! Online
Kanye West is shutting down this rumor.
After it was reported that he bought a ticket in front of Taylor Swift's Super Bowl suite and she then had him removed, the rapper's rep told Forbes, ""This is a completely fabricated rumor. It is not true.""
As for how the rumor got started, former NFL player Brandon Marshall alleged West picked a seat in front of Swift's suite at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium knowing the cameras would be on her as she cheered on boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chief in their big game against the San Francisco 49ers on Feb. 11.

""He had a mask on with his logo on the mask, right? Typical Kanye,"" the wide receiver said on a recent episode of I Am Athlete's Paper Route podcast. ""Taylor Swift gets pissed off. She boom boom makes a call or two. Everybody's involved. He gets kicked out the stadium….He was trying to leverage her celebrity.""
E! News has reached out to Swift's rep for comment but has yet to hear back.

It's no secret the two have a long history—one that dates back to when West interrupted Swift during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV VMAs. There was also that Snapchat video his ex Kim Kardashian posted in 2016 that appeared to show Swift and West talking about his song ""Famous"" on a phone call. (Refresher: Kardashian previously said she felt like she had to defend West and Swift maintained West never told her about the lyric ""I made that bitch famous."")
In her Time Person of the Year cover story, Swift reflected on how that moment felt like ""a career death"" at the time.
""You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,"" the singer told the magazine in the December interview. ""That took me down psychologically to a place I've never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn't leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn't trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.""
Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce are hoping Taylor Swift's fans can help take their podcast to new heights. The NFL superstars filmed a special edition of their podcast ""New Heights"" from Las Vegas and made a hilarious plea to the Swifties hoping their incredible influence will help them win iHeartRadio's podcast awards.
Needless to say, that wasn't the end of Swift's career—with her continuing on her successful Eras Tour, winning her history-making fourth Album of the Year Grammy for Midnights and getting ready to release her new album The Tortured Poets Department.

Kanye West denies former NFL star's claim that Taylor Swift had him escorted out of 2024 Super Bowl,"Taylor Swift remained a hot topic at Sunday's Super Bowl, where celebrity boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs won their third Lombardi Trophy in five years. She remains a hot topic days later, but for curious reasons involving a former NFL star.
Not long after Super Bowl LVIII, retired wide receiver Brandon Marshall, a six-time Pro Bowler who notably starred for the Denver Broncos and New York Jets, claimed on a podcast that polarizing artist Kanye West attempted to ""buy a ticket right in front of (Swift's) booth"" so that TV cameras would show West instead of Swift, only for Swift to ""make a call or two"" and have West ""kicked out of the stadium."" Except none of that actually occurred, a West spokesperson has since told TMZ.
West was photographed inside Allegiant Stadium on Super Bowl Sunday, while Swift was shown multiple times during the TV broadcast, later taking the field to celebrate the Chiefs' victory alongside Kelce.
The two musicians have a documented history, with West infamously interrupting Swift's acceptance speech during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to redirect attention to Beyoncé. But there's no indication they had any interaction whatsoever on Super Bowl Sunday. Marshall, for what it's worth, also misidentified Swift as fellow artist Katy Perry during his initial claims this week.",2024-02-14T16:08:09Z,https://www.cbssports.com,CBS Sports
Cam'ron & Mase Weigh In On Fake Taylor Swift & Kanye West Super Bowl Story,"Cam'ron and Mase are easily the best duo in sports media right now. Although some might say that title belongs to Shannon Sharpe and Stephen A. Smith, you cannot deny the power of It Is What It Is. These two continue to deliver incredible episodes and entertaining segments. Whenever they comment on something, you know it is going to be comedy. Overall, fans are quite fond of the show, and their following has only grown over time. If you love the rap duo, this is a great time for you.
That said, they had plenty to talk about following the Super Bowl. There was one report making the rounds yesterday which alleged how Taylor Swift had Kanye West kicked out of the big game. This news came from Brandon Marshall and it was met with skepticism. In fact, as we have already explained, the story was proven false by a source associated with Kanye West. Regardless, Cam and Mase speculated on what took place and even took sides. As Cam and Mase explained, they can easily see why Taylor would want Ye to be removed.

Cam'ron Gives His Take
“[He] tried to diss that young lady years ago, and she ain’t forget about it. She don’t want to be seen with you, let alone on the Super Bowl screen,” Cam'ron said. “That man got up there embarrassed Taylor Swift at them awards, tried to go Beyoncé crazy.” Later on, Cam'ron took Swift's side, saying “If she makes a call and says ‘I’m leaving if he don’t get out of here,’ he got to go."" In the end, it is all a moot point as none of this ever happened.
That said, the Super Bowl itself was fantastic. We got an overtime game that made a lot of people happy. While 49ers fans are probably still reeling from the loss, Chiefs fans are over the moon. Let us know what you thought of the game, in the comments section below. Additionally, stay tuned to HNHH for the latest news and updates from around the sports and music worlds.

Kanye West Denies Taylor Swift Got Him Kicked Out Of The Super Bowl,"Kanye West‘s rep denied that Taylor Swift got the rapper kicked out of the 2024 Super Bowl. The rumor was started by former NFL star Brandon Marshall, who claimed on his Paper Route podcast that Taylor, 34, had Kanye, 46, removed from Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas after he allegedly bought the seats right in front of the pop star. However, Kanye’s rep said there’s no truth to Brandon’s claims. “This is a completely fabricated rumor. It is not true,” the rep told TMZ on February 13.
While Kanye was at Super LVIII with wife Bianca Censori, 29, he wasn’t kicked out the stadium, nor did he sit in front of Taylor. Brandon, who watched the game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers in a VIP suite with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, made the unfounded claims about Kanye on his podcast the day after the February 11 game.
The former NFL wide receiver alleged that Taylor got “pissed off” that Kanye bought the seats right in front of the “Anti-Hero” singer and her squad. “She makes a call or two — everybody is involved — [and] he gets kicked out the stadium,” Brandon claimed. Brandon also mistakenly referred to Taylor as Katy Perry at first while sharing the story that’s been disproven.
Two days after the Super Bowl, Kanye trolled Taylor on his Instagram Story following the release of his and Ty Dolla Sign‘s album, Vultures I. Kanye shared a tweet that revealed he surpassed Taylor on Spotify’s Daily Top Artists Global chart for February 11. However, by the time Kanye posted about the accomplishment on February 13, Taylor took back the top spot.
As fans know, Kanye and Taylor have been at odds ever since the 2009 MTV VMAs. Kanye infamously stormed the stage when Taylor was accepting the award for Female Video of the Year, and declared that Beyonce was more deserving of the honor. While the two briefly made up in 2015, Kanye broke Taylor’s trust once again with the release of his 2016 song “Famous,” in which he raps, “I made that b**** famous.” He then proceeded to include a naked wax figure of Taylor in the video for the song.
While Kanye insisted that he called Taylor up and got her approval for the song, she clapped back and explained that she never previously heard the lyric where the rapper called her “that b****” on the track. To try and defend Kanye, his then-wife, Kim Kardashian, released illegal video recordings of the pair’s phone call. In 2020, the full video version of the phone call between Kanye and Taylor leaked, proving that he never ran the “that b****” lyric by her.
Taylor most recently addressed her beef with Kanye (and Kim) in her 2023 TIME “Person of the Year” interview. She claimed that Kim “edited” her conversation with Kanye about his “Famous” song. The “Love Story” singer also revealed how the backlash from the incident really took a toll on her. Taylor said she “moved to a foreign country” and “didn’t leave a rental house for a year” after the drama with Kim and Kanye.",2024-02-14T15:59:46Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
A Full Rundown Of Kanye West Restarting His 'Feud' With Taylor Swift After Allegedly Getting Removed From The Super Bowl,"It pretty much goes without saying that Kanye West and Taylor Swift have a “complex” history, to say the least. The situation started in earnest well over a decade ago with that infamous moment from the VMAs and, years later, more drama ensued between them as well as West’s former wife, Kim Kardashian. While the supposed “feud” between him and Swift seemed to subside after a while, sparks might be flying again. It was alleged days ago that the songstress had the hip hop star “kicked out” of Super Bowl LVIII this past weekend. And, on the heels of that, we’re going to give you a rundown of how West seemed to restart his feud with her afterwards. But, first, let’s start from the beginning.
(Image credit: Netflix/Republic Records/Hulu)
Why Don’t Taylor Swift And Ye Get Along?
Back in 2009, Taylor Swift won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video for her hit song “You Belong With Me.” As she gave her speech at the ceremony, Kanye West jumped on stage and interrupted. He addressed Swift, saying “Taylor, I’m really happy for you” and “I’ma let you finish” before declaring that “Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!” (That video in question was for “Single Ladies.”) From that point on, the relationship between the two artists seemingly became strained.
Additional drama cropped up in 2016 due to Ye’s single, “Famous,” from his album The Life of Pablo. Among the lyrics was the line, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. Why? I made that bitch famous,” upsetting Swifties. It was eventually reported that the fashion mogul received approval on the lyrics beforehand via a phone call with the pop star. The “Willow” singer, however, later suggested that wasn’t the case when she shaded the rapper while accepting the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2016.
Kim Kardashian became involved in the West/Swift drama after she released clips from the phone call that seemingly suggested Swift lied about not giving the thumbs up. However, the complete call leaked in 2020 and seemed to prove that she was telling the truth.
Since then, the two have rarely spoken about the controversies that link them. Though Taylor Swift did recall the Kim Kardashian situation during an interview that took place in 2023. She also made a rare nod at her feud with Kanye West at the end of that same year while performing at the Eras Tour. In some ways, it would seem that the two still have “bad blood,” but I’m not sure anyone saw this Super Bowl situation coming.

What Supposedly Happened With Kanye West And Taylor Swift At The Super Bowl, And How Did The Rapper Respond?
The “Shake It Off” performer was among the many celebrities to present at Allegiant Stadium in Nevada for Super Bowl LVIII. There, she rooted for her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (and even went viral for chugging a beer ). It was subsequently claimed, however, that Ye was also present and that she had him removed from the location. The allegation came from former NFL Player Brandon Marshall on his Paper Route podcast. He said the following in a clip from the show that was shared to X :
Kanye West pulls up to Vegas. Kanye West buys a ticket right in front of [Taylor Swift’s] booth. So, any time they were going to be showing [Taylor Swift], Kanye’s face was going to be there. … He had a mask on with his logo on the mask, right? Typical Kanye. Taylor Swift gets pissed off. She – boom boom – makes a call or two. Everybody’s involved. [Ye] gets kicked out the stadium. … He was trying to leverage her celebrity…
Since the former Denver Bronco made those claims, a representative for the Grammy winner himself has responded. According to the rep, who released a statement that was shared with Forbes , the rapper was not ousted from the packed arena:
This is a completely fabricated rumor. It is not true.
Aside from this message, Ye himself has not taken to the interwebs to share more details on his account of the matter. However, it would seem that he is stirring the pot in another regard. Based on a social media post he recently shared, he may have just reignited his “feud” with the Reputation producer.

What Did Kanye West Say On Social Media In The Aftermath Of The Super Bowl Brouhaha?
Ye’s social media habits can be unpredictable, to say the least. Just recently, he even scrubbed his Instagram account again amid questions about the racy photos he shares of his wife, Bianca Censori . Aside from all that, many surely took notice when he dropped a story post featuring a headline with a Spotify metric. Apparently, the “Jesus Walks” performer has now topped the “Look What You Made Me Do” singer as the top artist on the platform globally. You can check out his post for yourself down below:

As of this writing, it would appear that Taylor Swift has not responded to the message. On the surface, this may not seem like a total declaration of war. (We have, after all, seen Kanye West actually declare “civil war” on Pete Davidson .) Nevertheless, it’s very interesting that such a post would go up at this time, given the claim related to the Super Bowl. Only time will tell whether anything else arises as a result of this message.
At present though, both artists seem to still be marching to the beats of their own respective drums. Kanye West recently saw the release of his new album, Vultures, which he curated with Ty Dolla Sign. However, the compilation has stoked up controversy, as Ozzy Osbourne slammed him for apparently sampling his music without permission. West is also taking heat for a post-Super Bowl listening party is also taking heat due to the massive ticket prices, which were drastically reduced later in the night and left fans upset.
As for Taylor Swift, she’s coming off a massive year which involved her highly lucrative Eras Tour. She also topped it off with the accompanying movie of the same name, which proved to be a hit at the box office. Right now, she’s set to drop her newest album, The Tortured Poets Department, this coming April. She’s definitely going to be busy in the coming months and, all the while, some may keep watching to see if she chooses to fire back at Ye in any way.",2024-02-14T15:54:21Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Kanye West: Der Rapper hat wegen Titanzähnen eine Blase,"Kanye West reagiert auf Hate-Kommentare zu Outfits von seiner Frau Bianca Censori. Den Fans macht aber die Blase an seiner Lippe mehr Sorgen.
Rapper mit Titanzähnen : «Was zum Teufel ist das für eine Blase auf Kanyes Lippe?»
Darum gehts Kanye West reagiert auf Fans, die seine Posts zu Bianca Censoris Tanzeinlage kritisieren.
Er hatte das Video seiner freizügig gekleideten Frau dreimal gepostet.
Die Fans des Rappers diskutieren aber nicht das Statement, sondern die Blase auf seiner Oberlippe.
Kanye West (46) verteidigt die freizügigen Fotos von Bianca Censori (29), die Fans immer wieder irritieren und unter anderem dazu führen, dass sie sich fragen, ob Kanye seine Frau kontrolliert. Aber niemanden scheint zu interessieren, was er sagt. In den Kommentaren ekeln sich Fans wegen Kanyes Oberlippe.
Kanye hält die Kamera nah an sein Gesicht. «Wenn ihr nicht mögt, was ich poste, dann f**kt euch, lasst mich – den König – in Ruhe», sagt er. Gut zu sehen sind seine Titanzähne im Wert von rund 850'000 US-Dollar, die er sich kürzlich neu machen liess.
«Was zum Teufel ist das für eine Blase auf Kanyes Lippe?», fragt eine Person auf X. Ein paar vergleichen die Form der Blase auf Reddit mit einer Klitoris oder einem Hoden.
Kanye reagierte nicht auf die Kommentare über seine Oberlippe, aber er schlug betreffend der Kritik zu Fotos von Bianca zurück. Er hatte dreimal das gleiche Video von seiner Frau gepostet, wie sie mit einem Stofffetzen über ihrem nackten Körper in einem Club tanzt. In der Caption steht: «Noch immer der König.»
Wie schon bei anderen Outfit-Skandalen meinten die Fans in den Kommentaren, er demütige Bianca. So schreibt ein Fan: «König wovon? Idiotie. Frauen demütigen. Diese Frau denkt wahrscheinlich wirklich, dass du sie liebst.» Der Kommentar wurde über 1000 Mal gelikt. Ein paar Fans haben die halbnackte Bianca langsam satt, so schreibt jemand: «Wir habens gesehen, entspann dich.»
Kanye West: «Ich poste meine Frau, so oft ich will»
«Ich möchte nur sagen, dass ich meine Frau absichtlich dreimal gepostet habe», sagt Kanye in seinem Statement-Video. Kurz schwenkt die Kamera auf Bianca, die lachend mit ihm durch den Flughafen läuft. «Ich habe das Album geliefert und die Leute in meinen Kommentaren reden immer noch darüber, weshalb ich meine Frau poste», sagt er.
Kanye bezieht sich auf das gemeinsame Projekt mit Ty Dolla $ign (41) «Vultures 1». Auf dem Cover sieht man den Rapper komplett in Schwarz gekleidet, vor ihm steht die fast nackte Bianca. Das Foto erinnert an einen Skandal eine Woche vorher, wo die beiden ähnliche «Outfits» trugen.
Kanye fährt fort, er poste seine Frau, weil sie ihn glücklich mache. «Deshalb seid ihr alle mit der Musik zufrieden, weil ich glücklich bin.» Er beendet seine Videobotschaft damit, dass er die australische Architektin, die er im Dezember 2022 heiratete, posten werde, so oft er wolle.
Hast du dir Kanyes Musik angehört? Ja, das Album ist echt richtig gut. Noch nicht. Nein, ich höre seine Musik nicht.",2024-02-14T15:35:23Z,https://www.20min.ch,20 Minuten
Taylor Swift Never Had Kanye West Kicked Out Of The Super Bowl,"Taylor Swift and Kanye West have had a long history in the media. Overall, this feud has seemingly never gone away, even though neither have commented on it in years. Firstly, it all started when Ye jumped on stage and told Swift that she was not deserving of her VMA. It was a pretty bad look for Ye that left a bit of a stain on his career. However, they eventually patched things up until 2016 when he mentioned her in a negative light on the track ""Famous."" Since then, the opposing fanbases have been at war, and that has not changed.
Yesterday, a story went viral in relation to the Taylor Swift and Kanye West feud. Former NFL star Brandon Marshall claimed that Kanye was kicked out of the Super Bowl. As he explains, Ye allegedly bought tickets in front of Taylor's booth and was hoping to be on camera whenever she was. Swift caught wind of this and then had Ye promptly kicked out. However, as many noted, this just didn't make sense as Kanye was seen in a separate box throughout the game alongside Ty Dolla Sign and Anderson .Paak.

Thanks to an anonymous source connected with Ye, who spoke to HNHH directly, we can confirm that Marshall's story is absolutely false. Ye never bought tickets in proximity to Swift, and she never had him banned from the premises. It is interesting to contemplate where Marshall may have gotten this information from. Regardless, it is false and should not be taken as gospel. Instead, it seems like both parties enjoyed their evening and just left it at that.

"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign ""Vultures 1"" Sales Projections Revealed","Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign just came out with their brand-new project, Vultures 1. There are going to be two new iterations of this album coming out fairly soon. However, at this point, no one really knows if they will be released on time. We have been given some release dates of March 8th and April 5th. Overall, this is good news for the fans, but it could very well become a nightmare if the release schedule gets messed with. Considering Vultures 1 has 16 tracks already, it is hard to imagine what Ye will do next.
Either way, the album has been doing some massive numbers on streaming. This was always going to be the case when you consider just how massive Ye's fanbase is. They are cult-like and will do pretty much anything he says. By extension, they will listen to anything he puts out. Unsurprisingly, this is being reflected in some of the sales projections for the album. Below, it is being reported that Vultures 1 will see 140K units sold in its first week. For a Ye album, this seems low, but it will net him a huge return.

Based on the responses so far, the album is just okay as Ye may have rushed this one out.

In our latest news update: The rivalry between pop sensation Taylor Swift and Kanye West doesn’t seem to end any time soon. Former NFL star Brandon Marshall has said that Swift got the rapper removed from the stadium. According to a Fox News report, Marshall said on the “I Am Athlete” podcast, “Kanye West pulls up to Vegas. Kanye West buys a ticket right in front of [Taylor Swift]’s booth. Taylor Swift gets pissed off. She boom boom makes a call or two. Everybody’s involved. He gets kicked out the stadium.” Kelce had nine receptions for 93 yards in the Super Bowl, and Swift celebrated with him on the field after the game was over by kissing him.
Actor Cillian Murphy, who is a frontrunner to win the Oscar for Best Actor at the upcoming Oscars, spoke about the challenges of playing the complex historical figure J Robert Oppenheimer in director Christopher Nolan’s critically acclaimed blockbuster. In an interview with GQ, dismissing the rumour that he consumed only almonds for dinner during the filming of Oppenheimer, Murphy said, “This is apocryphal. I think Emily (Blunt) was being very sympathetic to me when she said Cillian only ate one almond a day. It was more than that. I didn’t really have room in my brain to be socialising with the rest of the cast and crew at the time.""
Next-up: The trailer of Damsel's movie shows a fantasy world where Elodie (Millie Bobby Brown) is set to marry the prince of the kingdom. But the wedding is just a scam that hides the sinister practice. Elodie is lured in by the royal family to be sacrificed to pay off an ancient debt. The official logline of the film reads, “A dutiful damsel agrees to marry a handsome prince, only to find the royal family has recruited her as a sacrifice to repay an ancient debt."" The film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, also stars Ray Winstone, Nick Robinson, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Angela Bassett, and Robin Wright.
Oscar winner Kate Winslet said she chose to do smaller projects after the global success of Titanic as life became quite unpleasant with fame. The 48-year-old star reflected on the media pressure and body image scrutiny she was subjected to after the release of James Cameron’s 1997 romance tragedy epic. Winslet told Porter magazine that, “I felt like I had to look a certain way, or be a certain thing, and because media intrusion was so significant at that time, my life was quite unpleasant. Journalists would always say, ‘After ‘Titanic’, you could have done anything and yet you chose to do these small things.’""
The talent behind this year’s leading Oscar-nominated films, including Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things, Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, gathered on Monday, 12th February for the annual Academy Award nominees luncheon. Pictures and videos from the event have since been shared on social media, capturing heartwarming moments among the luminaries. In one of the pictures, Murphy is seen chatting with Maestro actor Carey Mulligan and others, the media also managed to capture an “awkward Murphy” moment as he was interacting with Nyad star Annette Bening. Meanwhile, Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, whose snubs in the best director and best actress categories, respectively, caused a major stir.
Moving on: Actor Deepika Padukone has been announced as one of the presenters at the upcoming BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) awards, which is scheduled to be held on Monday, February 19 at London’s Royal Festive Hall. She will join fellow presenters footballer David Beckham, actor Cate Blanchett and singer Dua Lipa. The three celebrities are the latest confirmed names for the BAFTAs. According to Variety, the three global stars will be presenting one award each. Deepika had previously presented an award at the 2023 Oscars. The actor’s presence on the global stage is a reflection of Indian film stars’ popularity, which also drastically increased when SS Rajamouli’s film RRR won an Oscar in 2023.
After dominating the Golden Globe Awards and Critics’ Choice Movie Awards recently, director Christopher Nolan bagged the Directors Guild of America (DGA) Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film for Oppenheimer. Since 2013, the winner of the DGA Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film has also gone on to win the Academy Award for Best Director in nine out of ten instances. Speaking to The Associated Press after the Oscar nominations, Nolan said, ""Oppenheimer’s story is so relevant to that — not just the threat of nuclear weapons but also the burgeoning threat of AI and what it can do to our world.”
Lastly: The board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) has announced the addition of a new category to the Oscars recognising the achievement in casting for films. This new category will be introduced to the Oscars beginning with the 98th edition that will honour the films released in 2025. The first award in the new category will be handed out in 2026. Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang said in a joint statement, “We congratulate our Casting Directors Branch members on this exciting milestone and for their commitment and diligence throughout this process.” The rules for eligibility and voting for the inaugural award will be announced in April 2025.

Kanye West og Bianca Censori:,"Den amerikanske rapperen Kanye West (46) har flere ganger sjokkert med sine mange påfunn og uttalelser. Den siste tiden har rapperen og kona Bianca Censori (29) skapt flere overskrifter med bisarre og lettkledde antrekk.
Tidligere denne uken slapp West albumet «Vultures 1», og heller ikke dette har gått knirkefritt for ekteparet.
Daily Mail kan nemlig avsløre at West og Censori skal ha hatt en kjempekrangel etter et event hvor de skulle lytte til det nye albumet.
KRITIKK: Den kontroversielle multikunstneren Kanye West sjokkerte under en motevisning for sin hans nye Yeezy-kolleksjon. Vis mer
29-åringen skal nemlig ha advart han mot å komme med antisemittiske uttalelser - noe West ikke skal ha hørt på.
- Og jeg er fortsatt gal, bipolar, antisemitt. Og jeg er fortsatt kongen, sa West under livestreamen til eventet, ifølge den britiske avisen.
Da rapperen kom med uttalelsen ble streamen skrudd av - noe West skal ha blitt rasende over.
- De kranglet på fredag fordi Kanye ble rasende da de skrudde av sangen hans under arrangementet kvelden før, på grunn av hans uakseptable tekster, forteller en kilde nær Censori til avisen.
Videre mener kilden at 29-åringen blir brukt av ektemannen sin.
- Kanye tar ut all frustrasjonen fra situasjonen på Bianca, fordi han ikke har noen andre som vil høre på dritten hans.
- Han bruker henne for gratis promotering, bruker henne på coveret til albumet sitt, bruker henne som modell for klærne hans og hun lar ham ha denne kontrollen. Hun har bokstavelig talt blitt en rekvisitt, som en fjernstyrt dukke, som han kan få til å gjøre hva han vil.

Dagen etter dukket West opp alene på et arrangement for albumet i New York. Krangelen mellom de to skal ha vært grunnen for at Censori ikke var til stede for å støtte ektemannen.
West har flere ganger tidligere kommet med svært antisemittiske uttalelser. Tilbake i 2022, under et intervju sammen med konspirasjonsteoretikeren Alex Jones, trakk han blant annet frem ting han mente Hitler har gjort riktig.
- Jeg liker Hitler. De jødiske mediene har fått oss til å føle at nazistene og Hitler ikke hadde noe av verdi å tilby verden, sa West også under intervjuet.

Back in 2020, he tried to run for President of the United States. However, this did not work out for him. Instead, he received barely any votes and his whole campaign was a laughing stock. He ran on a bizarre platform centered around Christian nationalism. Furthermore, he had already endorsed Donald Trump years prior, who was already runny as the incumbent.
If you remember, a few years ago, there was a story that came out in which Trump allegedly called Kim Kardashian ""disgusting."" This happened during a meeting with Ye, and it led to a falling out of sorts. Ye wanted Trump to be his running mate and it's clear the former President was not interested. However, despite this feud, it seems like Kanye is firmly back on the Trump train. While surrounded by Paparazzi recently, he said: “Yeah of course, it’s Trump all day. What you talking ’bout? You know what it is.”

Kanye West Will Not Run Himself
Fans should not be that surprised by the endorsement. After all, Ye was hanging around Milo, Nick Fuentes, and even Candace Owens as late as last year. All of these figures are massive in right win circles and they have all endorsed Trump in the past. Now, we are in an election season where Trump could very well win back the Presidency. Many are scared of this scenario, although the Trump supporters are doing everything they can to get him back into the White House. At this rate, we could end up seeing Ye next to Trump at rallies. This is the first year that Ye is a Trump supporter during an election season in which he himself is not running.

Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign's 'Vultures 1': Album Review,"On “Do It,” nestled halfway through Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign’s collaborative album “Vultures 1,” America’s second-biggest controversy magnet raps, “You don’t like it? That’s your loss.”
Contending and conversing with West’s music in 2024 is an obstacle course. The rapper, undeniably one of music’s most influential creative forces, has spent the past few years making headlines less for his music than the controversies by his own hand (and mouth), alienating casual listeners with divisive rhetoric and forcing his core fan base to reconcile with their evaluation of art made by a deeply polarizing artist. Many of those who checked out on West’s music have found his repeated antisemitic remarks to be too toxic to stomach. No matter how viable the music, the mere notion of listening to a new West release is enough to drive them away.
Of course, it’s perfectly reasonable to disengage with art on account of its creator. West can often be his own greatest enemy, and to his own detriment. Over the past few years, he’s lost brand deals with Balenciaga, Gap and Adidas, plus representation from CAA and his lawyers. But throughout his career, West has consistently seen his music act as a redemptive tool. As far back as 2009, when he stormed the stage and infamously interrupted Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards, he then retreated to Hawaii for several months to work on “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” which ultimately became one of the defining rap albums of this century. While Taylor-gate still looms over him—not even he can seem to shake it, referencing her on “Vultures 1” track “Carnival”—his artistic merits weren’t wholly discredited, and it was clear that his creative light hadn’t dimmed.
Which is why “Vultures 1” arrives at a pivotal moment in West’s career. Public opinion of him has slanted so far in the red that it’s feasible to wonder if he’ll ever recover. And musically, it’s been shaky. Since 2016’s “The Life of Pablo,” he’s released a string of projects bursting with ideas but without the conductive precision to convey he knows when one works and another doesn’t. “Donda,” which he dropped in 2021, was overstuffed and lacked a cohesive vision, as if he’d assembled too many thought kernels, rendered them all individually valuable, and lined them up in one long, slogging row.
Thus brings us to “Vultures 1.” It isn’t the most groundbreaking album in his discography, but it’s the clearest vision that he’s presented in years. Its songs are mercurial yet intentional, each its own bizarre sector of a larger blueprint, and the 16-song set is often musically great, from the Brazilian funk sample on “Paperwork” to the bellowing horns of “Problematic.” Ty Dolla Sign‘s presence as co-pilot for the album is a wise move. He deepens the songs’ vitality, offering texture and harmonic jubilance where they could otherwise code as dense and opaque. As a solo artist, Ty has conveyed a rich understanding of how melody functions, and alongside some of the colder tracks on the album, his frayed vocals contribute an emotional heft that West can’t alone provide.
On a purely musical level, “Vultures 1” plays as a gothic collection of sharp aural moments that twists and shifts at each turn. West is an artisan of curation, and the team of musicians he assembles—88-Keys, Timbaland, No ID and dozens of others—offers variety and scope. The rolling drums and bleating bass line of “Back to Me” recall the patter of “Runaway,” while Ty’s warm harmonies play against an already controversy-stoking interpolation of Donna Summer’s “I Feel Love” on “Good (Don’t Die).” If there were any doubts that the old Kanye is forever lost, then the soulful “Burn” is a reminder of what made him such a creative wrecking ball in the first place.
Lyrically, however, those hoping for West to seriously reconcile with his public controversies will come up short on “Vultures 1,” where in characteristically antagonist form, he leans into them. His attempts to pour gasoline on the already raging fires are eye-rolling at best—“Keep a few Jews on the staff now, I cash out,” on “Stars”; “Anybody pissed off, gotta make ’em drink the urine / Now I’m Ye-Kelly, bitch,” on “Carnival”; and, of course, the tasteless “How I’m antisemitic? I just fucked a Jewish bitch,” on the title track—implying that he’s above it all. And in his mind, he probably is. But this is nothing new for West. As far back as his “College Dropout” days, he’s been consistently brash, egotistical and combative. Here, it’s once again on full display, and there’s no question that some of the lyrics bogging down “Vultures 1” are offensive and even morally problematic. West is fully aware of how he presents, and by the time he mutters “Crazy, bipolar, antisemite / And I’m still the king” on the album’s closer, it’s clear that it’s all by design.
That’s likely because he’s aware of his proclivities to surrender to instinct, as though all his ideas are worth pursuing. “You already know I’m impulsive,” he admits on the sneering “Keys to the City.” He reinforces the notion with a snippet of a Mike Tyson interview tacked at the end of “Hoodrat”: “No doubt he’s got some mental fuckin’ issues, most leaders do. The delusional issue, ‘I’m a god.’”
The issues don’t start and end there. West is at best musically compelling, and at worst—more often than not—a wanton edgelord, intent on saying some of the foulest things imaginable.” “Vultures 1” is the first in a trio of promised albums (though West fans know he’s quick to shift course from planned projects at any given time), and it’s a stark reminder that the artist the world once universally adored can’t—and simply won’t—outrun the mess he’s left in his wake.",2024-02-14T12:30:00Z,https://variety.com,Variety
Kanye West denies Taylor Swift had him 'kicked out' of Super Bowl 2024,"Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)

This could be the “ultimate lie.”
Kanye West denied a former NFL player’s claims that Taylor Swift had him “kicked out” of the Super Bowl on Sunday for allegedly buying tickets in front of her.
“This is a completely fabricated rumor,” a rep for West told TMZ Tuesday afternoon.
“It is not true.”
Brandon Marshall, who shared a VIP suite with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell during the big game, made the wild claim on his “Paper Route” podcast Monday, and provided no evidence to back up the allegation and even confused Swift for fellow pop star Katy Perry.
“So Kanye West pulls up to the Super Bowl. Kanye West buys a ticket right in front of Katy Perry’s booth so anytime they are gonna be showing Katy Perry, Kanye’s face was going to be there — he had a mask on with his logo on the mask,” Marshall, who played in the NFL for 13 seasons, alleged before correcting himself.

“So Taylor Swift gets pissed off [and] she makes a call or two — everybody is involved — [and] he gets kicked out the stadium,” Marshall, 39, continued, adding that the “Flashing Lights” rapper was trying to “leverage” Swift’s celebrity status to to make money whenever cameras panned to her.
Marshall’s claims were quickly proven false, as the Yeezy designer and his wife, Bianca Censori, were photographed at the game and shown on the CBS broadcast.

Images released from the game showed West, 46, standing next to a security guard — but the group was nowhere near the “Cruel Summer” singer’s star-studded suite, which appeared to surrounded only by excited fans.

Sources also told Page Six exclusively that the “Gold Digger” performer received a lukewarm welcome when he entered the Raising Cane’s suite, where Leonardo DiCaprio, his one-time friend, completely ignored him.

“There’s was no interaction whatsoever,” our source shared.
Swift, 34, and West’s long-standing feud began after her interrupted her at the 2009 VMAs and reached its apex in 2016 when the “Gold Digger” rapper name dropped her in his song “Famous.”

The “Blank Space” songstress claimed she never gave West permission to include the lyric, which motivated his then-wife, Kim Kardashian, to release audio purporting to show Swift did, in fact, give approval.
In typical fashion for West as of late, the “Jesus Walks” rapper wore a piece of religious iconography atop a full head covering at the big game, while Censori, 29, also modeled a black latex balaclava.
The vintage Alexander McQueen mask featured a three-dimensional white crucifix between the eyes and likely served as a tribute to the late fashion designer, who died by suicide on Feb. 11, 2010 — exactly 14 years earlier.",2024-02-14T12:15:21Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six

"Kanye West Causes Alarm With Weird ‘Growth’ on Lip After Spending $850,000 On Dental Implants","Kanye West has once again made headlines for not the best reason. The recent focus of public curiosity surrounds a distinct bubble seen on his upper lip, prompting discussions and conjecture among his devoted fanbase and the wider audience. The Grammy-winning artist recently debuted his eye-catching titanium dental implants, reportedly costing a staggering $850,000, during a public outing with Bianca Censori and Chris Rock.

The speculation continued with another user questioning, ""What’s that lil thing dangling from Kanye lips fr??"" And a fourth fan chimed in, jesting, ""He needs to fix the little testicle hanging from his lip before he speaks. YE you got something hanging on yo lip.""

Despite the barrage of inquiries and jests, West has yet to offer any explanation or response to the newfound attention on his lip adornment. Amidst the attention surrounding his recent dental implant and the curious bubble on his upper lip, West has found himself addressing criticism regarding his social media activity. Responding to those who called him out for sharing NSFW content featuring his wife, Bianca Censori, West made it clear that he deliberately posted these images. Expressing his frustration the rapper said, ""Y'all, I just want to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose."" He asserted, ""So what I'm saying is, I delivered the album. And people still in my comments talking 'bout, 'Why you posting your wife?'""

""Censori makes me happy, so he warned everyone not to say something negative ever again,"" he affirmed. In recent social media activity, Ozzy Osbourne raised concerns regarding Kanye West's alleged unauthorized use of a Black Sabbath song recording. According to reports from the New York Post, Sharon Osbourne has stepped forward to support her husband's stance, suggesting potential legal action against West.

El millonario rapero Kanye West, que solía ser una figura prominente en la industria, parece estar sufriendo el evidente rechazo de la élite de Hollywood. Según Page Six, el rapero y diseñador de moda hizo una incómoda aparición en la suite de la cadena de pollos Raising Cane’s durante el Super Bowl LVIII, donde se encontró con una fría recepción por parte de las celebridades presentes.

Entre los asistentes al gran evento deportivo se encontraba quien habría sido muy amigo de West, el actor Leonardo DiCaprio, quien a pesar de verlo, ni siquiera lo saludó. Pese a que hubieron rumores iniciales sobre escuetos “asentimientos” entre los famosos, lo cierto es que una fuente privilegiada confirmó que “no hubo interacción alguna”.
Las fuentes de Page Six contaron que el polémico cantante de Heartless entró a la suite el pasado domingo sin ninguna invitación formal ni por la mencionada marca ni por ningún otro asistente o invitado del asistente. “Entró unos minutos con su mujer Bianca Censori”, dijo un testigo. “Era como un tipo que se aparecía por las suites, en plan: ‘¿Puedo quedarme un minuto? ¿Puedo tomar algo gratis?’”.

Sin embargo, Kanye y su nueva esposa recibieron el rechazo generalizado del palco VIP, que estaba repleto de otras estrellas de Hollywood como Tobey Maguire, Vince Vaughn, Tyga, Wiz Khalifa, French Montana, la familia D’Amelio, Ashanti, Nelly, Diplo, Wayne Gretzky y Tiffany Haddish. Se sabe que también dejaron de lado al artista para disfrutar el partido.

La actual relación entre DiCaprio y West dista mucho de la que tenían en el pasado. Hubo momentos en los que ambos compartían escenarios y celebraciones como el espectáculo sorpresa que el rapero y 2 Chainz dieron en el 39º cumpleaños de Leonardo. Incluso, su aclamado primer Oscar en 2016 por El Renacido fue celebrado efusivamente por Kanye en redes: “¡Por fin! ¡Nuestro hombre! ¡Estamos tan, tan felices por Leo!”.
Sin embargo, las acciones y declaraciones controversiales del cantante de Stronger en los últimos años han mermado considerablemente su estatus dentro de la comunidad de Hollywood. Sus arrebatos antisemitas han llevado a que marcas como Adidas y Gap cortaran lazos con el artista en 2022. Además, su aparición el pasado diciembre con una capucha al estilo del Ku Klux Klan en Miami en la presencia de su hija North han aumentado el rechazo hacia Ye.
Con su hija en el escenario, el rapero presentó el setlist de su nuevo álbum en su fiesta ""Vultures Rave"" luciendo una capucha negra puntiaguda en lo que sería una apología antisemita al Ku Klux Klan
A mediados del año pasado, el cantante estadounidense y su esposa Bianca Censori protagonizaron un bochornoso incidente en Venecia, Italia, que captó la atención de medios y provocó consecuencias inesperadas.

Según se reportó, West, de 46 años, fue visto con los pantalones bajados en un paseo en barco por los famosos canales de la ciudad, mientras Censori, de 29 años, se encontraba frente a él. Aunque los detalles exactos del suceso son inciertos, las imágenes que circularon del momento llevaron a que la pareja fuera vetada por la compañía veneciana de motoscafos Venezia Turismo Motoscafi.
Este incidente no solo generó controversia en el momento, sino que ha encontrado un nuevo eco en la cultura popular a través de la música de West. En su reciente álbum Vultures 1, lanzado en colaboración con Ty Dolla $ign, una de las canciones, titulada Fuk Sumn, parece hacer referencia a este episodio con letras provocativas que insinúan la naturaleza pública del acto.

Ultimately, West released the Vultures song Carnival without the sample. According to the New York Post, Sharon Osbourne has now, stepped in to support her husband. A rep for Sharon said, “We are considering legal action."" The representative further mentioned that Ozzy hasn't directly communicated with West, but their respective teams have been in contact.

She said, “Kanye f–ked with the wrong Jew this time.” She also asserted that West's team requested permission to use Iron Man from Ozzy three weeks ago.

Meanwhile, towards the end of 2022, West unleashed a string of public antisemitic rants and offensive posts, leading to his social media accounts being blocked and significant partnerships with brands like Adidas and Balenciaga being terminated. Business Insider also reported that Adidas, which had collaborated with West on Yeezy sneakers, has now ended their partnership. In December 2023, approximately 14 months after his initial antisemitic outburst on X, West issued an apology statement, expressing his commitment to making amends and learning from the incident.

Despite West's apology, his unauthorized sampling of Ozzy's music without consent has intensified the controversy surrounding him. Moreover, Ozzy isn't the only one raising objections to West's recent music endeavors. According to USA Today, on Instagram, Donna Summer's estate accused West of sampling her 1977 hit I Feel Love without permission in his track GOOD (DON'T DIE) from the album Vultures. The estate claimed in an Instagram Story, which has since expired, that West initially sought permission to use the track, but it was denied. Subsequently, he allegedly altered the lyrics, had someone else re-record them, or used AI technology.
Yet, it remains uncertain if Summer's estate is contemplating legal action against West in this instance. On the other hand, Ozzy frequently grants permission for other artists to sample his music. However, Sharon said, “But the simple thing is, we don’t want to be associated with a hater."" Conversely, during the last Halloween festivities, Ozzy and Sharon donned costumes mimicking West and his wife, Bianca Censori. Ozzy sported an all-black ensemble reminiscent of West's style, while Sharon creatively covered her chest with a purple pillow, just like Censori's past fashion choices.",2024-02-14T05:35:13Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr

Marshall, a retired wide receiver, has suggested Swift worked her magic to have West removed from his seats to watch the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers clash at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.
He said West, 46, secured the seats in front of Swift’s VIP suite so he could purposely photobomb any camera footage during the game’s broadcast.
“(Kanye) was trying to leverage her celebrity,’ Marshall said on the I AM ATHLETE podcast.
“(So) Taylor Swift gets p....d off. She boom boom makes a call or two. Everybody’s involved. He gets kicked out the stadium.”
It is not yet known where Marshall sourced his information from and so far there is nothing to suggest any truth to his allegations.
The former footballer also at first confused Swift with fellow popstar Katy Perry when making the outlandish claims.
However, if true, the incident represents a win for Swift in her years-long feud with the controversial rapper — starting back in 2009 when West stormed the stage at the VMAs and embarrassed Swift as she was accepting an award for Best Female Video.
“Yo Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ll let you finish,” West infamously said as he grabbed the mic from the singer, then just 19-years-old.
“But Beyoncé has one of the best videos of all time!”
The drama continued when West released his 2016 song Famous in which he called Swift a ‘b....h’.
West was pictured at the Super Bowl with his Aussie wife Bianca Censori but it hasn’t been determined when he left the stadium.
He was seen wearing a full-face covering with a white crucifix on the front and an all-black leather outfit, while Censori was covered up in a black, oversized rain jacket and hooded accessory—far from her usual near naked looks.
West’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian was also spotted in the crowd.
His marriage to the Kardashian ended in 2021 and she is now dating Baltimore Ravens footballer Odell Beckham Jr.",2024-02-14T03:40:10Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow
Kanye West Accused of Being 'Obsessed' With Taylor Swift After He Releases a Diss Track,"Kanye West ignited a new controversy with his fiercest adversary by name-dropping Taylor Swift in his most recent album. The Donda rapper released a new song from his and Ty Dolla $ign’s album Vultures 1 on Saturday titled Carnival. “Why did she say she sucked my dick? (Ha) Then she says she ain’t sucked my dick (Ha) / She gon’ take it up the ass (Ha), like a ventriloquist (Ha) / I made six Taylor Swifts, (Ha) since I had the Rollie on the wrist (Ha) / I’m the new Jesus, bitch (Ha), I turn water to Crist (Ha),” West raps in the alleged diss track.
As per Variety, when the Bound 2 rapper interrupted Swift's 2009 Video Music Awards winning speech and said that Beyoncé ""had one of the best videos of all time,"" it marked the beginning of their turbulent relationship. Later West's song Famous, which he released in 2016, had the line calling out the Lover hitmaker, ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I brought fame to that bitch."" Following Swift's denial of West's assertion that she had agreed to the phrase ""I made that bitch famous,"" West's ex-wife Kim Kardashian released a tape of a conversation that created a false narrative where the Blank Space songstress appeared to have given her approval. The complete conversation went public in 2020, revealed West and his reality star ex-wife were wrong.

“You know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years,” Swift remarked in ire after exposing the couple at that time. As per Page Six, fans are not amused with the diss track. They expressed their opinion on X after the track dropped, “Taylor Swift was his target twice and has successfully moved on from both events and thrived. Meanwhile, Kanye feels the need to name-drop her every time he needs clout and attention,” one fan argued on X.
kanye west still unironically thinking he made taylor swift famous is so.. like if you’re the one using her name in songs TWICE because you’re desperate for attention, i don’t think you’re as relevant as you think you are — joy ✮⋆˙⸆⸉ (@onlyngelsfly) February 10, 2024
“Says a lot about how desperate he is to be relevant right now,” a second fan added. A Swiftie wrote, “Kanye West still unironically thinking he made Taylor Swift famous is so.. like if you’re the one using her name in songs Twice because you’re desperate for attention, I don’t think you’re as relevant as you think you are.” Another one said, “Kanye is the only [person] who’s gonna mention Taylor Swift’s name in an attempt to get relevant again and perhaps a bit famous."" A fifth fan wrote, “Just like when he begged to have her name in his song last time when he illegally recorded her call & his ex-wife edited it to paint TS as a liar.”

The ex-couple have still not apologized for their actions, Swift later admitted that the experience traumatized her, “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard. The track Carnival is currently trending on the number 1 spot, West posted a celebratory picture on Instagram with the caption, ""Mom We Did It We Number 1 Again Yeezy.com.""",2024-02-14T03:31:09Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Nessuno prende più sul serio Kanye West,"Caricamento player
Tre anni dopo Donda, il rapper americano Kanye West (che si fa chiamare oggi “Ye”) ha pubblicato un nuovo disco: è intitolato Vultures 1, è stato realizzato in collaborazione con il cantante Ty Dolla Sign, e la maggior parte dei critici ne ha parlato male, malissimo, o si è rifiutata addirittura di recensirlo. Dopo essere stato uno dei più celebrati rapper al mondo, West è infatti diventato un personaggio screditato e detestato da molti, che per via di insistenti dichiarazioni antisemite, sessiste, razziste, complottiste e più generalmente stupide e ignoranti ha reso pressoché impossibile far parlare di sé per la sua musica.
Non è che abbia perso del tutto il suo pubblico, anzi. West infatti mantiene ancora una significativa quota di fan: ci sono quelli storici che non l’hanno abbandonato nonostante i comportamenti e le opinioni riprovevoli di questi anni, ma anche quelli che hanno iniziato a seguirlo e ad apprezzarlo proprio perché è ormai diventato un simbolo della alt-right, l’estrema destra americana, e di un certo modo molto testosteronico, cinico e bullo di stare online. E ci sono ancora evidentemente milioni di persone a cui non interessa cosa dice, né sono suoi fan sfegatati, ma che sono interessati ad ascoltare la sua nuova musica.
Vultures 1 ha raggiunto il primo posto degli album più ascoltati su Spotify nel suo giorno di uscita, totalizzando con la sua canzone più ascoltata, “Talking”, 12,5 milioni di ascolti finora. Sono numeri grossi, anche se non enormi: “Tuta Gold” di Mahmood, canzone presentata a Sanremo e rivolta principalmente al mercato italiano, ha fatto quasi due milioni di ascolti in più da quando è su Spotify, cioè da una settimana.
Ma la considerazione della critica per West è praticamente scomparsa, e si è anzi trasformata in aperta ostilità, così come sembra essere definitivamente compromessa la popolarità di West tra il grande pubblico internazionale della musica pop e hip hop. Alla maggior parte della gente, insomma, non importa più granché di West, nonostante lui in questi giorni scriva su Instagram cose come “ANCORA IL RE” per accompagnare i video promozionali del suo disco, citandone una delle canzoni.
Con dischi come The College Dropout, Yeezus, The Life of Pablo e soprattutto My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, tra il 2004 e il 2016 West si era affermato come rapper formidabile e produttore di enorme talento, contribuendo a rendere l’hip hop un fenomeno globale. Nonostante le dichiarazioni controverse non fossero per lui una novità, più o meno a partire dalla campagna elettorale statunitense del 2016 però cominciò a dire cose sempre più compromettenti e assurde: che la schiavitù degli afroamericani fu «una scelta» o che Bill Cosby era innocente rispetto alle accuse di stupro, solo per dirne alcune, e si alienò progressivamente una gran parte dei suoi fan spostandosi drasticamente a destra, a partire dal sostegno all’ex presidente Donald Trump. A un certo punto aveva detto anche che gli era stato diagnosticato un disturbo bipolare, e in generale i suoi comportamenti sconclusionati erano stati attribuiti a possibili problemi psichiatrici, nel tentativo di comprenderli e motivarli.
Le controversie e le dichiarazioni false, sconvenienti, offensive e problematiche per mille motivi di West sono diventate un genere letterario, tanto da avere una propria, lunghissima pagina Wikipedia in inglese. Ma negli ultimi anni West ha raggiunto nuovi estremi, dicendo cose che di fatto nessuno in buona fede ha più tentato di giustificare o contestualizzare. Nel dicembre del 2022 arrivò a dire che amava «un sacco di cose» di Adolf Hitler, negò l’Olocausto, si identificò come nazista, e sostenne che fosse colpa dei «media ebraici» se la gente oggi pensa che il nazismo non abbia portato niente di buono al mondo. Ribadì questa sua ammirazione anche in un’altra intervista, in cui disse che le persone ebree controllavano l’America.
– Leggi anche: L’antisemitismo non se n’è mai andato
Da quel momento, West fu escluso dalla maggior parte dei contesti sociali e mondani, e le più importanti aziende interruppero i rapporti commerciali con lui: a partire da Adidas, che aveva con lui un imponente e fruttuoso accordo economico, la cui rinuncia ha comportato molti problemi alla azienda sportiva tedesca. Contemporaneamente, gruppi neonazisti e suprematisti bianchi americani cominciarono a esaltarlo: un cimitero ebraico di Chicago fu perfino vandalizzato con delle svastiche accompagnate dalla scritta «Kanye aveva ragione».
Nell’ultimo anno West ha fatto poco o niente per riparare i danni alla sua immagine. A un certo punto, per capire il livello, disse che dopo aver visto l’interpretazione dell’attore Jonah Hill (di famiglia ebraica) nel film 21 Jump Street aveva cambiato idea sulle persone ebree. Lo scorso dicembre ha chiesto scusa più seriamente, con un messaggio su Instagram scritto in ebraico, ma poche settimane dopo si era fatto vedere con una t-shirt di Varg Vikernes, il musicista black metal norvegese noto per il suo progetto Burzum e fervente neonazista condannato per l’omicidio del chitarrista Euronymous nel 1993. La copertina iniziale di Vultures 1 è a sua volta un evidente omaggio a Burzum, e usa lo stesso font con cui veniva scritto il nome della band di Vikernes.
Nel disco, insomma, West ha rivendicato il suo passato recente. Nel verso di una canzone dice per esempio: «come faccio a essere antisemita se ho appena scopato una troia (bitch) ebrea?». Ma più in generale i testi di Vultures 1 stanno facendo discutere per quanto sono scadenti: «deboli in maniera disarmante: se vi piacciono le rime sessuali deboli piene di doppi sensi che non fanno ridere, è decisamente l’album per voi» ha scritto sul Guardian Alexis Petridis, in una recensione in cui ha dato al disco due stelle su cinque. Secondo Petridis, il disco ha alcuni buoni momenti, che arrivano specialmente dai collaboratori, ma è comunque «incostante» e pieno di problemi.
A essersi distinta in particolare è stata l’opinione su Vultures 1 di Anthony Fantano, che è un famosissimo youtuber americano che recensisce le nuove uscite pop, rock e hip hop in un modo spassoso e talvolta provocatorio, ma che è anche estesamente rispettato tra chi si occupa di critica musicale su internet. Fantano ha seguito da vicino l’involuzione della carriera di West, e nel suo ultimo video ha detto di ritenere Vultures 1 «spazzatura non recensibile». Il problema secondo lui è che, anche volendo provare a separare la persona dalla musica, cosa che comunque dice di non essere disposto a fare, non si può, proprio perché i testi tengono assieme le due cose.
In ogni caso, anche musicalmente Vultures 1 «è una merda» secondo Fantano, che dice che alcune canzoni sono così brutte da essere «involontariamente ridicole». Secondo lui è il suo peggiore disco, nonostante arrivi dopo tre album (Ye, Jesus is King, Donda) considerati dalla maggior parte della critica come molto brutti.
Secondo Fantano, da quando il suo antisemitismo e il suo complottismo sono diventati più intensi e sistematici, West ha deciso di adottare la strategia di rivendicarli, fino a farne un vanto. Al punto che ora la sua immagine pubblica è irrimediabilmente legata a questo aspetto. Scusarsi e ricostruire una credibilità sarebbe un compito troppo difficile per West, che non si è mai dimostrato molto capace in questo genere di operazioni, e che secondo Fantano ormai ha allontanato da sé tutti quelli capaci di dirgli di no e quindi di aiutarlo. A partire dall’ex moglie Kim Kardashian, che secondo molti prima della separazione aveva un ruolo importante nel contenere il marito. Ora West è sposato con Bianca Censori, un’architetta australiana che ha partecipato attivamente nella promozione del marito e del suo disco, posando nuda o poco vestita per diverse foto sui suoi profili social e anche per la copertina ufficiale di Vultures 1.
Secondo Petridis, si vede che quello che West desidera di più è «una grande hit come quelle che pubblicava con impressionante regolarità», per smentire chi ritiene che il suo talento ormai sia scomparso e lui sia capace ormai solo di provocare. Volendo provare a empatizzare con lui, dice, si potrebbe pensare che «le sue azioni sono quelle di uomo che sta malissimo, manipolato dalla gente peggiore possibile, come il suprematista bianco Nick Fuentes». Ma ci sono molte più prove a sostegno della tesi che sia un estremista provocatore alla disperata ricerca di attenzioni e bisognoso di scandalizzare. Ma il risultato «è più deprimente che scioccante: sono le azioni di un uomo che pensa di potersela cavare perché ha fatto un disco così brillante da essere al di sopra delle critiche negative. Nonostante gli sparpagliati buoni momenti di Vultures, ha torto su entrambe le cose».",2024-02-13T23:00:00Z,https://www.ilpost.it,Il Post

Kanye West is being shunned by the Hollywood elite, it seems.

He didn’t exactly get a warm welcome.
Interestingly, sources tell us that Leo DiCaprio — a longtime pal of the disgraced rapper-turned-designer-turned-prolific-nutter — was among the starry throng and definitely saw West, but didn’t so much as acknowledge his one-time buddy.
At one point a source had told us the pair seemed to exchange nods and nothing else, but a source later said definitively: “There’s was no interaction whatsoever.”
Things were not always so.

The pair have been spotted hanging out together here and there over the years, and West even performed at DiCaprio’s birthday party in saner times.
In 2013, 2 Chainz and West put on a surprise show for “The Wolf of Wall Street” star at his 39th birthday bash at Tao.

We hear Tobey Maguire, Vince Vaughn, Tyga, Wiz Khalifa, French Montana, the D’Amelio family, Ashanti and Nelly, Diplo, Wayne Gretzky, Tiffany Haddish and various others were also there to catch the big game in Las Vegas.
Needless to say, West has become somewhat persona non grata after his series of shocking antisemitic rants and outbursts, which got him fired by brands including Adidas and Gap in 2022.

Kanye West recebe críticas por vídeo de sua mulher seminua,"São Paulo
O rapper Kanye West foi alvo de críticas após compartilhar no Instagram um vídeo em que sua mulher, Bianca Censori, aparece seminua numa festa. O artista postou o registro três vezes na plataforma.
""Na primeira vez, foi constrangedor, cara. Agora está ficando triste"", escreveu um internauta. ""Difícil defender você, parceiro"", disse outra pessoa.

Após a reação negativa, ele gravou um vídeo rebatendo as críticas. ""As pessoas ainda estão nos meus comentários falando 'por que você está postando sua esposa?'. Porque ela me faz feliz"", disse West. ""É por isso que vocês estão felizes com a música, porque eu estou feliz. Vocês entendem?""
""Portanto, nunca digam nada negativo"", acrescentou o rapper. ""Se você não gosta da minha página e não gosta do que estou postando, vá se ferrar. Sério, me deixe em paz.""
Ele afirmou ainda que não se importa com os comentários e que continuaria postando imagens de sua mulher.

Wegen Antisemitismus? Kanye West streitet heftig mit Bianca!,"Es scheint zu kriseln. Vor wenigen Tagen erregte Kanye West (46) erneut Aufsehen, als er bei einem Event anlässlich seines Albums ""Vultures"" bizarre Zeilen rappte. Diese bezogen sich auf die Vorwürfe, dass er antisemitische Äußerungen gemacht hätte. Und ausgerechnet Bianca Censori, die ihm sonst immer den Rücken stärkt, scheint nun die Nase voll zu haben: Kanye und seine Ehefrau Bianca hatten einen gewaltigen Streit!
Ein Insider verrät gegenüber Daily Mail: ""Kanye hat seinen ganzen Frust an Bianca ausgelassen, weil er niemanden mehr hat, der seinen Mist anhören will."" So habe Bianca hatte ihn zuvor sogar gewarnt, er solle keine antisemitischen Texte aufnehmen. Wegen der Auseinandersetzung mit ihrem Mann erschien das Model zu seinen Events nicht zu seinen Events aufgetaucht, wie zu einer Veranstaltung in der UBS Arena und zu einer After-Show-Party.
Eine weitere Quelle behauptet zudem: ""Er kam mehrere Stunden zu spät und hatte Bianca nicht bei sich. Er hatte eine richtig üble Laune!"" Schließlich verließ er das Event nach nur wenigen Minuten. ""Kanye hat die Leute, die ihm die Feier geschmissen haben, wirklich verarscht und es schien ihm egal zu sein"", äußert sich der Informant. Die häusliche Lage bei den beiden sei momentan sehr angespannt.

Wollte Kanye Taylor Swift beim Super Bowl die Show stehlen?,"Geht es schon wieder los? Kanye West (46) und Taylor Swift (34) liegen bereits seit über zehn Jahren im Clinch – und immer wieder kommt es durch das Verhalten des Rappers zu neuen Höhepunkten. Zuletzt erwähnte er seine langjährige Rivalin in ein paar anstößigen Zeilen in seinem neuen Song ""Carnival"". Einem Insider zufolge sollte es beim Super Bowl am vergangenen Sonntag in die nächste Runde gehen – doch Taylor kam Kanye zuvor und machte ihm einen Strich durch die Rechnung!
Dem ehemaligen NFL-Star Brandon Marshall zufolge hatte der Musiker vor, der Freundin von Travis Kelce (34) die Show zu stehlen. Das verrät er im ""Paper Route""-Podcast: Kanye habe sich angeblich extra die Plätze vor Taylors Stadion-Suite kaufen wollen, um ihre Auftritte im TV zu stören. Doch dazu kam es nie: Der Sportler behauptet, dass die ""Blank Space""-Interpretin ""ein oder zwei Anrufe"" getätigt habe, um den Ex von Kim Kardashian (43) so aus der Arena zu verbannen.
Ganz vom Spiel der Kansas City Chiefs gegen die San Francisco 49ers war der Grammy-Gewinner letztendlich nicht ausgeschlossen – scheinbar wurden er und seine Begleitung Bianca Censori nur auf andere Plätze verwiesen. Dort zog er mit seinem skurrilen Bekleidungsstil die Aufmerksamkeit auf sich. Kanye versteckte sein Gesicht hinter einer schwarzen Maske mit weißem Kruzifix.

Ex-NFL star claims Taylor Swift had Kanye West 'kicked out' of Super Bowl,"Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)

Ex-NFL star Brandon Marshall claims Taylor Swift had Kanye West removed from Super Bowl 2024 after the rapper allegedly purchased seats right in front of her star-studded suite.
Marshall, who shared a suite with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell at the big game, made the shocking accusation on his “Paper Route” podcast Monday — however, there is no evidence that the retired athlete’s claims are accurate.
In fact, when telling the story, Marshall notably confused Swift, 34, for Katy Perry, who was not even at the game Sunday night.
“So Kanye West pulls up to the Super Bowl. Kanye West buys a ticket right in front of Katy Perry’s booth so anytime they are gonna be showing Katy Perry, Kanye’s face was going to be there — he had a mask on with his logo on the mask,” Marshall, who played 13 seasons in the NFL, alleged before correcting himself.

“So Taylor Swift gets pissed off [and] she makes a call or two — everybody is involved — [and] he gets kicked out the stadium,” Marshall continued, noting that the “Heartless” rapper was trying to “leverage” Swift’s celebrity status to “make some” money whenever she was inevitably shown on TV.
However, Marshall’s allegations were thinly veiled, as West and wife Bianca Censori were photographed at the game, as well as shown in the stands during the CBS broadcast.
There was no mention of them being kicked out of Allegiant Stadium, a storyline that would have garnered a ton of traction if true.

“So then you got to go back to the beef, you know, of him cutting her off when she’s winning a Grammy and said Beyoncé should have won it,” the former Denver Broncos player added, referencing the infamous moment West ruined Swift’s speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.
“So that’s what he tried to do. He tried to sit in front of Taylor Swift yesterday.”
Swift’s rep didn’t immediately respond to Page Six’s request for comment, and a spokesman for the NFL declined to comment.

However, Kanye’s rep told TMZ, “This is a completely fabricated rumor. It is not true.”
West was seen wearing a head-turning crucifix mask atop a full head covering at the big game, while Censori, 29, also donned a black latex balaclava.

West’s vintage Alexander McQueen mask featured a three-dimensional white crucifix between the eyes and was likely a tribute to the late fashion designer who died on Feb. 11, 2010 — exactly 14 years earlier.
Photos from the game showed the “Jesus Walks” wordsmith standing next to what appeared to be a security guard nowhere near Swift’s star-studded suite.

Images also prove that the “Anti-Hero” singer’s VIP box was flanked by no one but fans excited to watch the matchup.
Swift and West’s bad blood began after her interrupted her at the VMAs in 2009 and reached its peak in 2016 when the “Gold Digger” rapper named her in his song “Famous.”
“I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex Why? I made that bitch famous,” he spit on the controversial tune.

Swift claimed she never gave West permission to use her name on the track, prompting his then-wife, Kim Kardashian, to release a phone call proving the pop star actually did give Ye the OK.
It was later proven that the recorded conversation was edited, but the damage was already done and Swift went into hiding for a year after being dubbed a “liar” and “snake.”
The 14-time Grammy winner eventually emerged back into the public eye with “Reputation,” an album thought to be mostly about West and Kardashian.

Kanye West sparks health fears by revealing lip growth,"Kanye West has sparked health fears by revealing a dangling growth on his top lip.
The 46-year-old rapper displayed the mystery protuberance as he posted a video of himself defending his right to post revealing pictures of his 29-year-old model wife.
He said in a clip posted to his Instagram that showed him speaking close to his camera and showing off his new set of titanium dentures that are said to have cost $850,000: “Y’all, I just want to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose.”
Bianca was shown walking beside Kanye as he shot the video in an airport, with the model dressed in a white YZY “wet” romper that goes for $20.
Kanye added: “So what I’m saying is, I delivered the album. And people still in my comments talking ’bout, ‘Why you posting your wife?’

“’Cause she makes me happy. That’s why y’all happy with the music because I’m happy. You understand?
“So don’t ever say nothing negative. If you don’t like my page and don’t like what I’m posting, go (away.)
“Seriously, leave me – leave the king… alone.”
Kanye signed his video off by saying he was going to post images of Bianca “as much as I want”.
Most fans shared their worries about the flesh blob on his upper lip instead of reacting to his take on criticism about his posts of Bianca.

On Monday, Kanye, 46, shared an Instagram clip of him sauntering through the airport.
The rapper responded to criticism about posting three identical posts of his wife online.
The clips showed Bianca wearing a scrap of material barely covering her body, following Sunday's Super Bowl in Las Vegas.
""I wonder how he would feel if his daughter dressed the way his wife dresses?"" commented one follower.
Body language expert Judi James said Kanye felt any criticism was ""demeaning.""
Kanye is as famed for his online rants as his 29-year-old wife is for her daring fashion choices.
After divorcing Kim Kardashian, Kanye's antisemitic statements led to brands cutting ties.
Since Kanye married Bianca, the Aussie model has regularly been photographed wearing next to nothing.
“Kanye set out to create a mean and moody message to his critics,” James told The U.S. Sun.
“He has wanted to enjoy this sense of a beautiful trophy wife, that will make other men envy him and what he has.

“But when he posts Bianca’s nearly nude poses and gets negative comments, he finds it demeaning.
“This is why he used terms like Superhero and King to describe himself.
“Ironically, Bianca has fast become his Achilles' heel regarding the rising criticism he now responds to.
“We can see in the airport rant that Kanye feels insecure.”

Noticing Kanye’s metal grills, James suggested his new teeth bolstered his ""intimidating"" response efforts.
“Kanye raised his top lip in a punk-infused snarl,"" she said.
""He displayed his metallic gnashers in a gesture of intimidation.
“He sees them as part of a tough new profile and a fashion statement.
""He exposed the clenched teeth, to signal an attack.
“Kanye also held his camera and angled it to make an even greater feature out of them.”
Seconds in, Kanye mentioned his new album, Vultures, before returning to the topic of sharing raunchy images of his wife.
“Cause she makes me happy. That’s why y’all happy with the music because I’m happy. You understand?” he said.
“Leave me — leave the king — the f**k alone,” he complained.
“I don’t care bro. I’m going to post my wife as much as I want. Go post your wife on your f**king Instagram,” Kanye added.

James said Kanye's body language changed when Bianca dashed past him.
“Bianca grinned and laughed, as though she saw Kanye as her playmate and provider of fun,” she said.

“There was no sign of any worries about interrupting him as he spoke to the world.
“Kanye’s tough guy persona crumbled instantly. He broke into spontaneous, mirrored laughter.
""Bianca skipped by with one hand held out towards him, and he giggled.
“He appears to have forgotten the camera at the moment.
""Then it caught him with his mouth open, giggling and looking lovesick as he gazed after her.”

Within moments, Kanye’s mood changed again. James claimed he quickly “reapplied” his angry face.
“Kanye’s mood changes here are lightning switches,"" she said.
""He moves from a state of building aggressive arousal and indignation to giggly and playful.
“There is a re-application of the angry face, which is dramatically quick.
“This sandwich-filling state does look the most spontaneous and authentic.
“It suggests his macho body language could be more contrived and performed.
“It would be tricky to drop a genuine state of bad mood arousal this quickly and this comprehensively.”

Since marrying in secret, the pair have shown off plenty of PDA together, at times getting them into trouble.
In January, Kanye started sharing sexy images of Bianca online.
These included ones from the confines of a luxury hotel suite kitchen and the bathroom of their Los Angeles apartment.
This weekend, the loved-up couple were at the Super Bowl alongside plenty of other stars, cheering on and partying with football fans.
Bianca was snapped wearing a cut-out bodysuit that only covered small areas of her naked frame.

“It would be interesting to see how this long-term trend for Bianca to appear nearly nude in public affects her,"" said James.
“She looks excited, happy, and upbeat in this brief video.
""This is despite living in the real-life version of a classic nightmare scenario for many people.
“Being naked in public is a common dream scenario.
""There are many possible interpretations, regarding symbolism or suppressed emotions.
“It can suggest a dread of standing out from the crowd, being judged, or fearing rejection.”

Kanye West takes aim at Taylor Swift on social media,"Kanye West takes an aim at Taylor Swift on social media
Kanye West took an aim at Taylor Swift whilst simultaneously celebrating his latest feat on Spotify.
The 45-year-old rapper did not care for subtlety as he posted a screenshot from a tweet from Daily Loud, claiming that West has “overtaken Taylor Swift as the top artist globally on Spotify.”
The post featured a collage of the duo as well as a snap shot of West’s name glistening on the top, followed by the Lover singer's on the chart.
However, according to reports, Taylor has once again dethroned the Power rapper by occupying the #1 spot.
Fans took to X, formerly Twitter, to express their distaste towards the Yeezy mogul’s shenanigans.
“he knows she makes him famous that’s why he keeps talking about her,” wrote one user.
“It’s incredibly crazy the ability he has to set himself up lol,” expressed another.
West and Swift have been at odds since their public altercation nearly a decade ago, which also involved the former’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian.

Kanye West concerns over abnormal upper lip growth amid Vultures concert in LA,"Kanye West's Las Vegas Performance Raises Eyebrows as Fans Express Concerns About Upper Lip Growth
Kanye West made headlines as he performed for his new album, Vultures, in Las Vegas, drawing attention not only for his musical endeavors but also for a concerning growth on his upper lip.
Previously reported by Dailymail West had spent approximately $850,000 on the experimental dental surgery, but now, attention has shifted to the visible lump on his top lip.
Speculation regarding the growth arose following an Instagram video posted by Kanye on Monday, where he kept the focus on himself while walking through an airport with his wife, Bianca Censori.
Fans expressed their concern, with one questioning, ""What’s wrong with ur top lip? Something is going on?? Hmmmm??""
Another Twitter user echoed the sentiment, asking, ""What the hell is that lump in the middle of his top lip?""
Initial reactions to West's titanium teeth last month ranged from admiration to skepticism, with some fans speculating that the rapper sought attention and social media clout with the substantial investment.
The experimental dental procedure was conducted by Beverly Hills-based Dr. Thomas Connelly, alongside master dental technician Naoki Hayashi.
Speaking to DailyMail.com, Connelly praised West's collaboration, stating that the rapper's artistic vision transcended traditional dental aesthetics.
Connelly emphasized that West's unique vision, coupled with dental science, resulted in an extraordinary new look.
The 46-year-old rapper, accompanied by Ty Dolla $ign, took to the stage on Monday, following Super Bowl LVIII.
Donning a peculiar mask during the performance, West captured the audience's gaze as he showcased tracks from the newly released album.
Outside the venue, West was spotted surrounded by security personnel, seemingly returning to his awaiting vehicle.
The concert, announced by West on Instagram just a day prior, garnered attention from fans and media alike.
Alongside details of the event, West shared an image representing Vultures Volume One, captioning the post with venue information: ""VULTURES YE & FRIENDS 3120 S. LAS VEGAS BLVD LAS VEGAS 02 11 24 ¥$.""",2024-02-13T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Taylor Swift KICKED OUT Kanye West from 2023 Super Bowl stadium: Claims,"Taylor Swift 'kicked out' Kanye West from Super Bowl 2024 according to claims
Taylor Swift seems to not bother while getting Kanye West kicked out of 2023 Super Bowl, when the rapper tried to steal the singer’s spotlight.
Former NFL player Brandon Marshall has shockingly claimed that Taylor Swift had Kanye West ejected from the Super Bowl after the rapper attempted to upstage her on Sunday night.
Swift allegedly ""made a call"" to have Kanye removed from the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas after he purposefully purchased seats in front of hers.
The 34-year-old singer, Anti-Hero, was in a VIP box with Kelce's family and friends, Blake Lively, Ice Spice, and Lana Del Rey, as they watched her boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs defeat the San Francisco 49ers.
Former NFL wide receiver Marshall said that Kanye, 46, was purposefully lining up to take pictures of Taylor in order to photobomb any footage of her that was shown during the game.
Marshall, a former NFL wide receiver, accused Kanye, aged 46, of strategically positioning himself in front of Taylor with the intention of photobombing any footage of her during the broadcast of the game.
“[Kanye] was trying to leverage her celebrity,” Marshall said on the I AM ATHLETE podcast. “[So] Taylor Swift gets p****d off. She boom boom makes a call or two. Everybody's involved. He gets kicked out the stadium.”
Where Marshall obtained his knowledge is unknown, and there is no evidence to support the veracity of his claims.
While making the outrageous charges, the former NFL player did originally mistake Swift for fellow popstar Katy Perry.",2024-02-13T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Kanye West shunned by Leonardo DiCaprio at 2024 Super Bowl?,"Kanye West ignored by Leonardo DiCaprio at 2024 Super Bowl
Kanye West seems to have no friends left to greet him.
According to Page Six, somewhat awkwardly, the vocal anti-Semite wearing a Klan hood showed up out of the blue in Raising Cane's Super Bowl suite on Sunday to watch the game with a host of other well-known celebrities.
It was not exactly a cordial reception for him.
Leo DiCaprio, a longtime friend of the disgraced rapper-turned-designer, is reportedly among the star-studded crowd and saw West, but he didn't even acknowledge the former friend.
A source initially informed us that all the two appeared to do was nod to one other, but a source then declared categorically that ""there was no interaction whatsoever.""
It wasn't always like this.
Over the years, the two have been seen hanging out; in happier times, West even gave a performance at DiCaprio's birthday celebration.
The ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" star received a surprise performance from 2 Chainz and West at his 39th birthday celebration at Tao in 2013.
When the actor finally won an Oscar in 2016 for the film The Revenant, West nearly lost his mind. ""At last! Our man! At the moment, the Jesus Walks rapper tweeted, ""We're so so happy for Leo!!!""
According to insiders, West wasn't even a guest of a guest, nor was he invited to the room by the rapidly expanding bird business.
“He came in for a few minutes with his wife [Bianca Censori],” said an insider, “He was just like a guy dropping into suites, like, ‘Can I stick around for a minute? Can I get a free drink?'”",2024-02-13T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

Kanye West’s apparent “lip growth” is no cause for concern, according to celebrity dentist Dr. Clement Kairouz.
The “All of the Lights” rapper caused concern when he shared a video on social media addressing the risqué images he shares of his wife, Bianca Censori, but all fans could focus on was the bump.
Kairouz, who works at Apa Aesthetic New York, however, tells Page Six exclusively that the bump is due to a dental bridge he had installed that is pushing his upper lip out.
“Kanye has always had a prominent cupid’s bow and upper tubercle tissue, so I do not think we’re looking at tissue overgrowth,” Kairouz, who has not treated West, tells us.
“Photos suggest he got a fixed bridge that does not respect natural oral anatomy or leave space for soft tissue,” Kairouz explains, adding that the bridge is “over-projected” and has pushed “his lip forward, making it appear more prominent.”

Reps for West didn’t immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.
The Yeezy designer, 46, debuted his $850,000 titanium dentures last month, which a source told us were actually “fixed prosthodontics” that are permanently adhered to his teeth unlike grills or veneeers.

“All that said … his teeth weren’t removed,” the source added.

Kanye West's Copyright Infringement Lawsuit Dropped,"Kanye West has seemingly been in legal trouble constantly for years. Some of them have been the kind of purely absurd lawsuits that grab headlines like the Donda Academy lawsuits. They claim that all the windows in the school were removed because West didn't like glass. But much of the legal proceedings have been much more mundane and that was the case with a copyright infringement case spawning from a 2021 video West shared to social media.
Videographer Elijah Graham sued West last year for allegedly stealing a video he recorded and posting it to social media. The video was a clip of West himself discussing his wife and kids while serving meals to homeless people. The video went viral for his seemingly earnest self-reflection. “We’ve made mistakes. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve publicly done things that were not acceptable as a husband... but I’m here to change the narrative,” West says in the clip. According to Billboard, the lawsuit wasn't being ""prosecuted diligently"" and Graham ultimately agreed to drop it entirely.

Kanye West Scores Legal Victory
It's pretty good news for West to get this legal drama off of his plate. That's because there could be even more legal drama coming down the pipe soon. West recently released his new album Vultures with Ty Dolla Sign. After a listening party in advance of the album's release he was called out for two uncleared samples on the album. Both the estate of Donna Summer and Black Sabbath front man Ozzy Osbourne called out West for using samples despite being denied clearance and either could pursue legal action.
Vultures is still being processed by West's fans and critics alike. The album has received some backlash for its controversial lyrics and seemingly unfinished sound. But some fans are still riding with the project, which sports a myriad of features from some of the biggest names in rap. What do you think of Kanye West escaping a copyright lawsuit even amidst threats of more legal action? Let us know in the comment section below.

"Kanye West Receives Candace Owens Co-Sign After The Release Of ""Vultures""","Kanye West is someone who has received co-signs from people who perhaps aren't the best examples of who you want to be associated with. Overall, this was very much true during his anti-semitic era which one could argue is still ongoing. He got co-signs from the likes of Nick Fuentes, Milo, and even the creator of the Proud Boys. Although he has distanced himself from those characters, there are still some on the right who continue to praise him. One such person is none other than Candace Owens.
Overall, Owens is controversial for a plethora of reasons. Although her popularity has certainly died down since 2020, she continues to be a big name on the right. She is one of those people that will comment on everything, even if they aren't super involved in it. Moreover, she will comment even if she does not know much about it. The type of person that would say a Tom MacDonald album is the epitome of good music. Well, her good friend Ye just dropped Vultures, and below, you can find her review.

""Congratulations, Kanye. Cancel culture has been officially cancelled,"" Owens said on Twitter. So, yeah. That is pretty much it. Instead of offering up real critiques about the production, the lyrics, the features, Owens has made Vultures a culture war issue. At the end of the day, that is all art is to some people. For most, art is a way to connect with the world around you and feel something. Unfortunately, for others, it is a means to an end in the realm of politics.

Kanye West Says He Was '2 Months From Going Bankrupt',"Kanye West is riding high with his and Ty Dolla $ign’s Vultures 1 album finally arriving around the globe. But he shares that not long ago, things weren’t that great. TMZ caught up with Ye upon his return from Las Vegas for Super Bowl LVIII inside LAX on Monday (Feb. 12), when he told the outlet that he was just a couple of months from bankruptcy last year before his latest comeback.
“I’ma just be honest with y’all: I was two months from going bankrupt and I put everything I had into it and we moved to Italy,” he revealed. “We moved to the factories and we survived. We survived through the cancellation. We back No. 1.”
Vultures 1 is Kanye’s first project to arrive independently since Def Jam/Universal were among the myriad brands such as Adidas to split from the Chicago native following his string of controversies and antisemitic remarks in late 2022. After Ye was dropped by Adidas, Forbes shared that the rapper had dropped off its list of billionaires.
“It wasn’t about the controversy, it was about the ability to say how you felt out loud,” West explained. “If I didn’t have the various skill sets of music, clothing and the fan base, they would’ve been able to destroy me. But because we had all those skill sets, somehow, I’m here inside this universe able to fight. I love all the people that supported.”
He continued: “So many people would lose their jobs, lose their careers for the steps we took. We went down for like a year and a half.”
“Carnival” appears to be the Vultures track receiving the most fan support, as the tune — which Billboard ranked No. 1 in the album’s songs ranking list — featuring Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti is atop the Spotify Global chart. It remains to be seen if West will earn his 10th No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 next week.

"Kanye West's Ex Reveals Original Sketches For ""The College Dropout"" Mascot On Album's 20th Anniversary","Kanye West is stirring up controversy nowadays, especially over the past year. While he has always been an outspoken individual for or better or worse, we cannot deny his creative vision. But right now, some are having a hard time separating the music from the person. Just ask ""the internet's busiest music nerd"" Anthony Fantano. However, before we really got to see the slow downward mental spiral of Ye, many people saw him as a hard-working rapper/producer. From 2003-2004, the Georgia-born talent was working on creating his debut The College Dropout. That means the project is now 20 years old, as well as its creative ideas.
To help remember this incredible record, Kanye's ex, Alexis Phifer, shared some drawings of the famous bear mascot, according to HipHopDX. The first of the school-themed trio celebrated its 20th anniversary on Saturday, February 10. If you look at the artwork on The College Dropout, Late Registration, and Graduation, you will notice the mammal in some shape or form. Phifer shared that the inspiration for the bear comes from the luxury clothing brand Ralph Lauren.

Phifer wrote a long paragraph explaining how this all came to fruition and how she still has them to this day. ""With the record label asking him for the ideas he had in mind, Kanye started to sketch out his vision that evening at my house. First, he started with the heads, then the body, then the belt. After he was done and pleased with what he had, he faxed the sketches the next day to the record label."" She continues, ""After faxing his final idea, he was about to throw the sketches away! That’s when I asked if I could keep the artwork instead."" Even though they split in 2008, she still shows Kanye and the LP its respect. ""[It] is a hip hop classic. It was the beginning of what would mark one of the most influential rapper’s life and legacy.""
What are your thoughts on the original sketches for Kanye West's The College Dropout bear mascot? Is this his greatest album still, why or why not? Do you still go back to it, and if so what tracks?

"Anthony Fantano Goes To War With Kanye West's Fanbase After Calling ""Vultures"" An ""Unreviewable"" Album","Anthony Fantano is easily one of the most famous music reviewers on the entire planet. However, he is also extremely controversial for this very reason. Giving your opinions can lead to a lot of pushback. Overall, this is especially true when you are reviewing albums from artists who have a cultish fanbase. Kanye West is certainly one of those artists. His diehard fans will do anything he says, and they will twist narratives to make it seem like everyone else is incorrect. They think they have the whole world figured out, but oftentimes, it is just 15-year-olds looking to be entirely too edgy.
Before Fantano even attempted to review Vultures, Ye's fans ganged up on him and predicted a negative review. The YouTuber listened to the album on a livestream and clearly did not enjoy it. However, instead of giving one of his usual reviews, he dubbed the album ""Unreviewable."" In the video below, he makes a compelling case for why this is true. Ultimately, it boils down to Ye's fans diluting the discourse and being extremely toxic. Fantano knows whatever he says won't be taken in good faith, so why even bother?

Anthony Fantano Makes A Compelling Case
As you can imagine, this conclusion set off a fury of anger amongst Kanye's hivemind. Numerous fans posted Fantano's reaction to the Playboi Carti verse on ""Carnival"" and dubbed it ""disrespectful."" Others said Fantano was trying to be a good person by bringing up the political aspects of Ye's work. Moreover, plenty of other Ye stans resorted to name-calling. For instance, some pounced on Fantano for being divorced. Ironically enough, so is Kanye West. Sure, Kanye has married again, but let's be for real for a second.
Ye Fans React
The average Kanye west stan on Twitter is filled with delusion and hate. A Fantano review should never make you this mad. As he says at the end of all of his videos, it is just his opinion. If you can't handle that, then maybe the internet just isn't for you. You can see some of the tweets from Ye stans, down below.

"Kanye West's Weight Gain Due To Medication, He Says While Discussing Alleged Mental Health Misdiagnosis","Like so many of his creative contemporaries, Kanye West's brain is anything but average. Over the past few years, he's claimed the title of bipolar, which he examined in 2018's Ye and beyond. More recently, though, fans have seen the Yeezy founder come forward with claims of being autistic, notably citing his car crash from decades ago as a trauma that radically altered his brain chemistry. Some people have expressed skepticism on the validity of this news, but still, Ye doubled down on it all during a new interview with TMZ.
""Black people can't be Anti-Semitic, we are Jews,"" he said in the clip below, touching on another massive controversy West is involved in. ""You understand what I'm saying?"" he asked the camera in his face, while wearing his new James Bond villain-inspired grills. ""We are Jew! Until you really do the facts of the fake indoctrination that y'all putting into the schools and all of that... We not following y'all's rules,"" the ""Good Morning"" artist insisted before apologizing to Jewish kids who admire him and had to witness the drama of the past few years. ""We got to a point where something needed to happen,"" West told the outlet.

After months of unsurprising delays, Kanye West's Vultures LP has finally made it onto DSPs.

"Kanye West Dodges Palestine Question: ""I Don't Have Enough Information""","Kanye West says he doesn't have an opinion on the conflict between Israel and Palestine and is more focused on the violence in his hometown of Chicago. West avoided speaking out in support of Palestine when asked about the topic during an interview with TMZ at LAX.
""I don't have enough information on that,"" Ye told the outlet. ""I'm a straight up n***a from the Southside of Chicago, born in Atlanta, I don't have enough information. It's love for everybody. But don't pull me into that conversation. I got 14 kids dying every week in my city. So talk to me about that.”

Despite Ye’s lack of a stance, many other artists in hip-hop have voiced their support for Palestine in recent months. West’s former collaborator, Kid Cudi, wrote that he can’t remain silent back in November. ""I can't watch what's happening in the world and remain silent,"" Cudi said in part at the time. ""I can't imagine the pain people are feeling. Seeing their entire neighborhoods bombed, losing generations of family members, parents crying over their children's lifeless bodies, communities turning into mass graves, people digging through rubble of their homes in hopes of finding remains of their loved ones.""
Kanye West Speaks With TMZ
Elsewhere in his interview with TMZ, West discussed his past antisemitic remarks, being canceled, and much more. His comments come after Israel rejected Hamas' cease-fire plan, last week, and committed an attack on Rafah, the city where Israel had previously told Gazans they would be safe. According to NPR, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remarked that peace could only be achieved through a ""total victory"" against Hamas. Be on the lookout for further updates on Kanye West on HotNewHipHop.

"Fans Were Not Pleased After Kanye West Charged $350 For A Last-Minute Show, Then Dropped The Price Drastically","As Kanye West continues to contend with controversies related to statements he’s made in the past few years, the polarizing rapper is still working. He most recently marked the release of his latest album, Vultures, on which he collaborated with Ty Dolla Sign. One of the ways that he’s capitalized on the debut of the new music is by holding listening parties in different locations. His most recent show was reportedly a last-minute affair that took place in Las Vegas, for which he charged $350 per ticket. Now, according to sources, fans were later upset that he later lowered the price drastically, and they apparently took issue with other aspects of the party.
Ye’s listening party was reportedly held in a tent venue somewhere on the Las Vegas strip following Super Bowl LVIII and was announced by the star on Instagram just earlier that day. The function, which offered fans the opportunity to listen to the artist’s new tunes, was apparently quite pricey, according to The U.K. Sun . While basic tickets cost $350 per head, the V.I.P. balcony option went for $750, and $25,000 was charged for a balcony table. The price for that first option eventually dropped to $150 later in the night, though, and the move allegedly rubbed attendees the wrong way. As previously alluded to, that’s not all that left them fuming.
The “Homecoming” performer was present at the event alongside his legally wed wife, Bianca Censori, who was in the V.I.P. section. His 10-year-old daughter, North West, and Ty Dolla Sign, were also there, and the trio eventually danced together to the music while on stage. However, attendees said that Kanye West didn’t arrive on stage until midnight and was supposedly supposed to arrive an hour earlier. Fans also say that West – who was wearing all black and a mask – never uttered a word during the event. Additionally, he also sectioned off part of the location’s main floor for “space” and restricted fans from using professional cameras, while his own video team moved around the place.
Though a number of fans seemed to be enjoying themselves, others described the situation as chaotic. By the end, two fights broke out, leading to multiple people being removed from the space. When discussing their experience with the Sun, one unnamed person said:
While a lot of loyal fans enjoyed the show, it was disheartening that he never said a single word on stage when the ticket price was so high. It was obvious it was organized very last minute and nobody knew what to expect. It was classic Kanye, I'm surprised he didn't come on at 2 am.

This isn’t the only one of his recent listening parties that has landed him in hot water. Last week, he held another one at the United Center in Chicago, and one of his new songs caught the attention of rock legend Ozzy Osbourne. The fashion mogul apparently sampled the British musician’s music for his track “Talking / Once Again.” Osbourned proceeded to slam Ye , and his wife, Sharon, later explained that the rapper submitted a formal request. However, they denied it, as they do not want to be associated with him.
Aside from the two listening parties and music sampling, Kanye West has made some questionable decisions as of late. West recently wiped his social media account clean again and also spent $850K to replace his teeth with metal “prosthodontics.” Also, much speculation continues to surround his marriage to Bianca Censori, who he posted a photo of early in January to signify the year of “no pants.”
It remains to be seen whether Kanye West has any other listening parties planned for his new album. And, if any are on the horizon, it’ll be intriguing to see whether any changes will be made to avoid the reported issues that cropped up during his Las Vegas performance.",2024-02-13T15:47:22Z,https://www.cinemablend.com,CinemaBlend
Kanye West nel nuovo album Vultures 1 campiona i cori della curva degli ultras dell’Inter,"La curva nord interista appare tra i crediti dell'ultimo album in studio pubblicato dal celebre rapper statunitense, il cui nome oggi è Ye (ma che tutti continuiamo a chiamare Kanye West...). Lo scorso week-end il musicista americano ha pubblicato la sua nuova fatica discografica, realizzata in collaborazione con Ty Dolla Sign, dove ha campionato il coro degli ultras dell’Inter usandolo in due brani: “Carnival” e “Stars”
Kanye West ha campionato i cori della “Curva Nord” dell’Inter nel nuovo album Vultures 1.
Gli ultras della Curva Nord della squadra milanese appaiono proprio tra i crediti dell'ultimo album in studio pubblicato dal celebre rapper statunitense, il cui nome oggi è Ye (ma che tutti continuiamo a chiamare Kanye West, è inultile...).
Lo scorso week-end - l’8 febbraio 2024 - il musicista americano ha pubblicato la sua nuova fatica discografica, realizzata in collaborazione con Ty Dolla Sign, dove ha campionato il coro degli ultras dell’Inter per inserirli in particolare in due brani: Carnival e Stars.
Nel primo pezzo, Carnival, i cori vengono riportati come Choir Vocals, mentre nel secondo - Stars - vengono citati come Crowd Vocals aggiunti a Federico Secondomè (autore e producer) e al cantante ZLYAH.
In fondo a questo articolo potete guardare il videoclip di Carnival, una delle due canzoni in cui compaiono i cori degli ultras nerazzurri.
West lo scorso ottobre aveva visto a Marassi la partita fra Genoa e Milan
Come ricorda in queste ore Sky Sport, il rapper statunitense lo scorso ottobre aveva visto a Marassi la partita fra Genoa e Milan. I cori dei tifosi nerazzurri a San Siro campionati come base mostrano una scelta assolutamente voluta, dato che la Curva Nord viene citata come ‘credit’ in entrambi i brani.
Per quanto riguarda l’indubbia passione calcistica di West, come il dettaglio aggiunto nel suo nuovo disco attesta, questa gli è stata trasmessa dal figlio Saint (8 anni), nato dalla precedente relazione fra il rapper e Kim Kardashian. Uno dei desideri di Kanye West e del piccolo Saint era proprio quello di assistere dal vivo a una partita di calcio in Italia, desiderio realizzato lo scorso 7 ottobre, quando sono stati ospiti d’onore a Marassi durante un Genoa-Milan.

L'influenza calcistica si sente in tutta la sua potenza
Nelle due canzoni sopraccitate si sentono le parti corali che provengono dal nostro ben noto mondo calcistico, dove con “nostro” si intende “nostrano”, nel senso che il club in questione è italiano. In Carnival, l'influenza calcistica si sente in tutta la sua potenza, così tanto che all'inizio il titolo della canzone doveva essere addirittura intitolata Hoolygans. Il coro, in inglese, apre il brano e lo chiude, in due momenti in cui non c'è accompagnamento musicale ma soltanto il suono delle voci degli ultras.

In tanti si lamentano di Kanye West per sample non autorizzati, ma non l’Inter...
Dopo l'uscita del nuovo disco di Kanye West, in molti si sono lamentati (con tanto di mezzi legali, spesso e volentieri) perché il rapper statunitense avrebbe utilizzato campionamenti non autorizzati di alcuni artisti, tra cui Dolly Parton e i Black Sabbath. Proprio riguardo questi ultimi, l’ex frontman della leggendaria band Ozzy Osbourne - il cosiddetto “padrino dell’heavy metal” - non ha affatto apprezzato l'uso di un sample non autorizzato della canzone Iron Man del suo gruppo. Il suddetto sample è un riff di chitarra che si ascolta nella canzone in cui compaiono anche i cori della Curva Nord dell'Inter: si tratta di Carnival (che potete ascoltare in fondo a questo articolo). approfondimento Kanye West rielabora Everybody dei Backstreet Boys (senza permesso)
Ozzy Osbourne contro Kanye West e Ty Dolla Sign
Il mitico Ozzy Osbourne si è scagliato contro il duo West/Ty Dolla Sign perché avrebbero utilizzato il riff di chitarra di Iron Man, brano dei Black Sabbath contenuto nell’album Paranoid del 1971. Per chi volesse verificare di persona, il campionamento in questione è disponibile al minuto 1' e 45'' della traccia Carnival. Inoltre, come notato dal magazine musicale Rockol, anche nel video sull'evento di Chicago dove il disco è stato presentato in anteprima si sente quel sample, ossia al momento 1' e 16’’. L’ex cantante dei Black Sabbath ha dichiarato: “Gli è stato negato il permesso perché è un antisemita e ha causato dolore a molti"".

"Kanye West: ""Άντε γ@*@$ε, θα ποστάρω τη γυναίκα μου όσο θέλω""","Ο διάσημος ράπερ, γνωστός ως ΥΕ, απάντησε οργισμένος στις κατηγορίες για την Bianca Censori
Ο διάσημος ράπερ Kanye West, γνωστός ως ΥΕ, συνεχίζει ακάθεκτος να ανεβάζει στους λογαριασμούς του στα social media βίντεο και φωτογραφίες της σχεδόν γυμνής συζύγου του, Bianca Censori, παρά την κατακραυγή που έχει προκαλέσει αυτή η εμμονή του.
Στην πιο πρόσφατη ανάρτησή του, ανέβασε (3 φορές) βίντεο της γυναίκας του, να διασκεδάζει ημίγυμνη στο after party του Super Bowl.
Το βίντεο έλαβε τόσο αρνητικά σχόλια από τους followers του - ότι δεν σέβεται την γυναίκα του, την εκμεταλεύεται κτλ - που τελικά απάντησε οργισμένος στις κατηγορίες για την Bianca Censori, βρίζοντας τους θαυμαστές του.
«Αν δεν σας αρέσουν οι αναρτήσεις μου, άντε γ@*@$. Αλήθεια, παρατήστε με, αφήστε μόνο του τον γ$@!* τον βασιλιά. Δεν με ενδιαφέρει φίλε μου. Θα κάνω αναρτήσεις με τη σύζυγό μου όσο θέλω. Βάλε τη δική σου γυναίκα στο δικό σου γ$@!* Instagram» ακούγεται να λέει στο βίντεο που ανέβασε, ενώ η Bianca περνάει δίπλα του.
«Λοιπόν θέλω να πω σε όλους ότι ανέβασα φωτογραφίες 3 φορές το βίντεο της συζύγου μου, εν γνώσει μου, γιατί αυτό με κάνει χαρούμενο. Αυτό που λέω είναι ότι κυκλοφόρησα δίσκο και ακόμα ακούω σχόλια του τύπου ""κάνεις αναρτήσεις με τη γυναίκα σου;"". Το κάνω γιατί με κάνει ευτυχισμένο. Γι' αυτό σας αρέσει η μουσική μου γιατί εγώ είμαι χαρούμενος οπότε μη λέτε τίποτα αρνητικό. Αν δεν σας αρέσει η σελίδα μου και δε σας αρέσουν οι αναρτήσεις μου, άντε γ@*@$. Αλήθεια, παρατήστε με, αφήστε μόνο του τον γ$@!* τον βασιλιά. Δεν με ενδιαφέρει φίλε μου. Θα κάνω αναρτήσεις με τη σύζυγό μου όσο θέλω. Βάλε τη δική σου γυναίκα στο δικό σου γ$@!* Instagram» ειπε ο West.

Kanye West Escapes Lawsuit Over Viral Video Of Thanksgiving Speech,"Kanye West is no longer facing a copyright lawsuit that claimed he illegally posted a 2021 viral video clip of a public speech about his then-wife Kim Kardashian, after his accuser dropped the case.
Explore See latest videos, charts and news Kanye West Ye See latest videos, charts and news
The embattled Donda rapper (now legally named Ye) has been repeatedly sued over the past two years, and he might soon be hit with new lawsuits over allegations of illegal sampling from Ozzy Osbourne and Donna Summer. But at least one such lawsuit is now in the rearview mirror.
In court papers filed last week, videographer Elijah Graham agreed to voluntarily dismiss a lawsuit he filed against West last year. The case claimed the rapper had stolen Graham’s clip — which captured West speaking candidly about Kardashian and his kids while serving a Thanksgiving meal to homeless people on Skid Row in Los Angeles – and posted it to Instagram without permission.
“We’ve made mistakes. I’ve made mistakes. I’ve publicly done things that were not acceptable as a husband, but right now today, for whatever reason — I didn’t know I was going to be in front of this mic — but I’m here to change the narrative,” West says in the video, which went viral after he posted it.
In a complaint filed in October in Los Angeles federal court, Graham’s lawyers claimed that West’s post amounted to willful copyright infringement. But since filing the case, they have done little to move the case forward; in an order last month, the judge overseeing the lawsuit threatened to dismiss the case entirely because it was not being “prosecuted diligently.”
An attorney for Graham did not return a request for comment on why he was dropping the case. A rep for West did not immediately return a request for comment.
Graham’s case might be over, but Ye is still in legal hot water. He’s currently facing two separate lawsuits filed by employees at his Donda Academy over allegations of unsafe conditions and wrongful termination; he’s also defending against another copyright case that claims his “Life of the Party” illegally sampled a song by the pioneering rap group Boogie Down Productions.
And more copyright cases could be on the way. Last week, both Ozzy Osbourne and the estate of Donna Summer publicly accused West of using their songs without permission on his new album ‘Vultures 1’, even after they had specifically rejected his requests for licenses. In an interview with Billboard, Osbourne’s wife and manager Sharon said they had “been in touch with his team” about legal issues, while Summer’s estate directly alleged “copyright infringement.”",2024-02-13T15:25:29Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Kanye West, de la exclusividad al saldo: la última estrategia del rapero para promocionarse","La Super Bowl, ese mercadillo global interrumpido por un partido de fútbol americano, es siempre un poderoso generador de conversaciones, en especial gracias a unos anuncios con los que las compañías rivalizan para llamar la atención de los 202 millones de espectadores que siguieron el acontecimiento a través de la televisión este año. Dentro de ese maremagnum de actores, actrices y cantantes que engrosan su cuenta corriente por aparecer durante unos segundos en un espacio publicitario (desde Ben Affleck anunciando donuts a Beyoncé haciendo lo propio con la telefonía móvil), en esta ocasión se ha colado el siempre polémico y cada vez más errático Kanye West, ahora conocido como Ye. Y lo ha hecho de una manera prácticamente casera: con un vídeo grabado con su móvil.
Capturado en el interior de un vehículo en marcha y con una paupérrima iluminación, el rapero y empresario estadounidense se dirige de manera escueta y directa al público: “Hola a todos, soy Ye y este es mi anuncio. Como nos hemos gastado todo el dinero en el espacio publicitario, no nos hemos gastado nada en el propio anuncio”. El clip, de 30 segundos, ha costado cero euros en su grabación y 7 millones de dólares para ser emitido durante las pausas comerciales de la Super Bowl. Pero si sorprende la estrategia, más propia de aquello que se denominó como marketing de guerrilla como eufemismo de “no hay presupuesto”, también lo hace el objetivo del vídeo: anunciar que toda la ropa de su línea de moda Yeezy se puede adquirir en su página web a 18,95 euros. Un precio irrisorio si pensamos que uno de esos productos, las botas Yeezy Pods, se pusieron a la venta en diciembre por 200 dólares (unos 185 euros).
De la exclusividad a las rebajas
West ya había anunciado hacía semanas su intención de rebajar las prendas de su marca, declaraciones que, como todas las que salen de su boca, generaron suspicacias. Hablamos de un artista conocido por anunciar la salida de sus discos para luego retrasarlas tantas veces como le apetezca. En este caso, ha cumplido su promesa coincidiendo con la salida de su nuevo álbum, Vultures, firmado junto al también rapero Ty Dolla Sign. Pero si sorprende la decisión es por un cambio de paradigma en la estrategia de Yeezy, la firma que le unió con Adidas desde 2015 hasta 2022, año en el que la compañía deportiva decidió poner fin a la colaboración a raíz de varios comentarios antisemitas que el artista hizo en público.
Desde sus comienzos, Yeezy se había basado en la exclusividad y el acceso limitado a sus productos, en especial a los modelos de zapatillas con los que West consiguió convertirse en un icono de la moda urbana, el llamado streetwear. Cada lanzamiento se convertía en un reto para aquellos que querían conseguir sus modelos, con pares limitados en tiendas físicas primero y más tarde con sorteos a través de webs y apps para optar a comprar un par de zapatillas. Una estrategia que, al igual que otras marcas, fomentó un mercado de reventa que, en 2023, el banco de inversión TD Cowen valoró en 30.000 millones de dólares en todo el mundo. Un modelo que buscaba en lo casi inalcanzable un estatus de exclusividad que ha ido perdiendo fuelle en los últimos años, con un mercado saturado y unas cifras infladas.
La decisión de West llega en un momento de crisis de popularidad para el que la que fuese una de las personalidades más influyentes de la música global durante la década pasada. Y puede parecer uno más de los intentos del artista por llamar la atención, o también otra de las muestras de un carácter cada vez más a la deriva. Pero también, si nos atenemos a los datos publicados por él mismo a través de Instagram, de una estrategia comercial que ha generado 19,3 millones de dólares (casi 18 millones de euros) en un solo día. Visto de otro modo: no importa lo alejado de la realidad que parezca West para que su nombre siga generando una atención que se convierte en dinero.
Una serie de catastróficos escándalos
Octubre de 2022 parecía el comienzo del fin de Kanye West como rey Midas de la música y la moda, aunque en realidad sus salidas de tono habían comenzado mucho antes. Mitad durante años de una de las parejas más poderosas e influyentes del entretenimiento junto a Kim Kardashian, su divorcio, oficializado ese mismo año, parecía inaugurar una caída sin fin en el que cada noticia hacía dudar aún más de su capacidad de recuperación como figura pública. Desde entonces, ha convertido los detalles de la custodia de sus hijos con Kardashian en carne de titulares y diatribas en redes sociales. También en ataques a las distintas parejas de su exmujer, entre ellas el cómico Pete Davidson, con quien protagonizó un cruce de declaraciones en los medios con la salud mental de West en entredicho. Pero el punto de no retorno parecía llegar con las declaraciones del artista sobre la esclavitud, su cuestionamiento de la campaña Black Lives Matter y sus comentarios antisemitas.
Dos años después, West sigue generando conversación, a veces presentado por los medios de comunicación como un bufón de la era de la atención constante, pero siempre presente de una forma u otra. Esa maquinaria de generar polémicas abarca casi todo: sus desplantes a sus fans con sus continuos anuncios de nuevas canciones que casi nunca cumple, sus decisiones estéticas (una de las últimas, una funda de titanio para sus dientes que inspiró el bulo de que se había extirpado varias piezas dentales) o la relación con su nueva esposa, Bianca Censori, sobre la que ejerce una influencia para muchos desmedida, eligiendo sus estilismos y supuestamente modelándola a su antojo. Una espiral de escándalos y caos que, de momento, puede haber acabado con la credibilidad del Kanye West artista, pero no con él como marca.

Kanye West Reveals Why He Can't Be Anti-Semitic And Why He Can't Be Canceled,"Kanye West is someone who has always been controversial. Overall, he has maintained a certain level of controversy ever since he burst onto the scene. However, things took a turn for the absolute worst back in 2022. This is when Ye started making anti-semitic ramblings. Furthermore, he began hanging out with white nationalists like Nick Fuentes. It was all very concerning but Ye kept up the charade. Now, he has an album out and there are people who have essentially forgotten about his existence.
That said, there are still millions of people ready to support Ye, no matter what. Recently, the Vultures rapper was approached by TMZ while at the airport. It was here where he was asked whether or not he apologizes for the things he said in the past. Overall, Ye wasn't too focused on dishing out an apology. Instead, he claimed that the only ones he feels bad for are Jewish kids. He also claimed that he could not be anti-semitic because black people are the real Semitic people.

Kanye West Speaks Out
As for cancelation, well, Ye feels as though cancelation is simply something that cannot happen to him. He believes that this is because he is simply too interesting of an artist for people to stop listening to. It is a pretty interesting theory. Although if you look at what is happening with Anthony Fantano right now, it is clear that Ye just has a cultish fanbase. They believe in everything he does, and if you disagree, you are somehow the bad guy. Either way, Ye continues to succeed, despite everything.

Wegen seiner Titanzähne: Fans sind in Sorge um Kanye West!,"Er sorgt für Aufsehen. Kanye West (46) ist nicht nur einer der erfolgreichsten Rapper, sondern hat sich auch in der Modewelt einen Namen gemacht. Dabei ist es kein Geheimnis, dass der US-Amerikaner mit seinem Äußeren gerne mal auffällt. Das gelang ihm in der Vergangenheit auch immer wieder. Nun ist es jedoch nicht nur sein Look, sondern vielmehr seine Gesundheit, die für Aufmerksamkeit sorgt. Kanyes neueste Zahnsanierung besorgt seine Fans!
Auf Instagram teilt der 46-Jährige ein Video, in dem er gemeinsam mit Ehefrau Bianca Censori durch ein Flughafengebäude spaziert. Jedoch fällt seinen Fans dabei vor allem eins ins Auge: Auf der Oberlippe des Musikers scheint sich eine deutlich erkennbare Wucherung gebildet zu haben. Prompt zeigt sich Kanyes Community in tiefer Sorge um ihn. Verantwortlich machen sie dafür vor allem seine umstrittene Zahnoperation, mit der er seine Zähne durch eine Prothese aus Titan hatte ersetzen lassen. ""Was zur Hölle ist das für eine Beule in der Mitte seiner Oberlippe?"", kommentiert ein User.
Während Kanyes Fans aktuell um seine Gesundheit bangen, feierte Bianca den ""Gold Digger""-Interpreten noch vor wenigen Wochen für dessen eigentümlichen Beauty-Eingriff. Mehrere Fotos, die Page Six vorlagen, zeigten damals, dass sie die neuen Beißer ihres Mannes sogar als ihr Handy-Hintergrundbild eingestellt hatte.

It was one of the most entertaining finishes to a Super Bowl in recent memory, and fans loved every bit of it. However, there are some interesting narratives coming out of this Super Bowl that have fans curious about whether or not they are true.
One such narrative was espoused by former NFL star Brandon Marshall. While on the Paper Route Show, Marshall claims to have inside information on what went down in front of Taylor's booth. As he explains, Kanye West bought a ticket that would put him in front of her booth. Therefore, he would be on camera with her throughout the evening. As Marshall explains, Swift didn't like this and made some calls. Subsequently, Kanye allegedly got kicked out.

Did Taylor Swift Really Make The Boss Call?
“He’s got a mask on with his logo on the mask — typical Kanye,” Marshall said. “Taylor Swift gets pissed off, she boom boom makes a call or two. Everybody’s involved. He gets kicked out the stadium! He was trying to leverage her celebrity … That’s what he tried to do; he tried to sit in front of Taylor Swift.” The issue with this allegation is that Ye was very much in the stadium for most of the evening. In fact, he was in his own box with Ty Dolla Sign and Anderson .Paak. Not to mention, if this actually happened, Ye would be the first to say something about it. Needless to say, the authenticity of the report is questionable.
Let us know what you think of this report from Marshall, in the comments section down below. Do you think Taylor actually did this?

"Kanye West: Er rappt mittlerweile so, wie Donald Trump spricht","Geierstunde mit Kanye West: Vultures 1 heißt das neue Album des allseits gehassten, geliebten und bemitleideten US-amerikanischen Superstars, es erschien am vergangenen Wochenende und enthält 16 Lieder, in denen der Rapper sein Publikum in unterschiedlichen Varianten darüber unterrichtet, dass er der König der Könige ist, unerreicht unter den Musikern und unter den Menschen. Auf dem Cover des Albums sieht man einen Mann, bei dem es sich mutmaßlich um Kanye West handelt, mit einer Maske vor dem Gesicht sowie in schwarzer Montur, die so gut zu einem abendlichen Rundgang zur Schutzgelderpressung passen könnte wie zu einem Feierabendbesuch im Fetischsexclub. Neben ihm ist eine Frau von hinten zu sehen, nackt bis auf ein Stück Stoff über der Pofalte und zwei schwarze Lacklederstiefel; bei ihr handelt es sich mutmaßlich um Wests aktuelle Lebensgefährtin Bianca Censori, zuletzt vor allem dadurch aufgefallen, dass sie sich in der Öffentlichkeit in seiner Begleitung in durchsichtigen Fummeln zeigte.
Im ersten Lied Stars lässt sich Kanye West von einem Kinderchor die Aufwartung machen, ""I hope he's bright and big and strong"", wobei unklar bleibt, ob die Hoffnung sich auf Jesus, den Erlöser, richtet oder auf Kanye West, den Erlöser. Vielleicht sind beide auch eins: ""I'm the new Jesus, bitch"", rappt Kanye West in dem Stück Carnival, in dem er noch eine ganze Reihe weiterer Inkarnationen seiner selbst präsentiert: ""Now I'm Ye-Kelly, bitch, / Now I'm Bill Cosby, bitch / Now, I'm Puff Daddy rich / That's MeToo me rich"", er ist R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, Puff Daddy in einem und auch noch jeder beliebige andere Sittenstrolch. Der neue Jesus Christus ist für Kanye West mithin derjenige, der die Männer von der MeToo-Bewegung erlöst: ein""iron man"", dem die sexuelle Emanzipation der Gegenwart nichts anzuhaben vermag. Als ""iron man"" ließ er sich in der ersten Version des Carnival-Stücks von dem Gast-Rapper Playboi Carti huldigen, worauf ein Sample aus dem gleichnamigen Song der britischen Metalband Black Sabbath folgte. Dessen Gebrauch wurde Kanye West unterdes untersagt: ""(...) weil er ein Antisemit ist und vielen Menschen unsagbares Leid zugefügt hat"", wie Black-Sabbath-Sänger Ozzy Osbourne erklärte, ""ich will mit diesem Mann nicht in Verbindung gebracht werden."" Und seine Gattin Sharon Osbourne sekundierte: ""Da hat er sich mit den falschen Juden angelegt.""
Tatsächlich hat Kanye West im vergangenen Jahr vor allem durch antisemitische Ausfälle von sich reden gemacht. Er beschuldigte eine jüdische Weltverschwörung, ihn an seinem Erfolg hindern zu wollen; er drohte allen Juden mit der Auslöschung, posierte in Ku-Klux-Klan-Kutte und verbreitete als ersten Cover-Entwurf für das Vultures-Album einen Schriftzug, der bei dem antisemitischen, neuheidnischen Black-Metal-Musiker Varg Vikernes alias Burzum entliehen war, sowie, dazu irgendwie passend, die Graustufenvariante eines Caspar-David-Friedrich-Gemäldes mit einem Geier auf einem Spaten (Landschaft mit Gräbern, um 1836). Nun ist Antisemitismus unter den Popmusikern der Gegenwart wahrlich kein Alleinstellungsmerkmal mehr (siehe auch: BDS, Strike Germany, Ravers for Palestine und so weiter). Kanye West verlor diverse Marketing-Verträge, aber auch das macht ihn nur stärker, wie wir in King, dem letzten Stück des neuen Albums, erfahren: ""Crazy, bipolar, antisemite / And I'm still the king"", heißt es dort. Diese Haltung verbindet ihn natürlich mit Donald Trump, dem er wiederholt seine Zuneigung bekundet hat wie die Bereitschaft, ihm im Falle eines Falles als Vizepräsident zu dienen. So ist es auch kein Zufall, dass das Vultures-Album, nachdem es mehrfach verschoben worden war, nun gerade am Wochenende des Superbowls erschienen ist. Während die Welt darauf wartete, ob Taylor Swift bei dieser Gelegenheit endlich eindeutig zur Unterstützung der Demokraten aufrufen würde, inszenierte Kanye West sich als Anti-Swift: als das antiwoke, antifeministische Gegenmodell zu der jungen Heldin der liberal denkenden Jugend.
Leider rappt Kanye West inzwischen auch häufig so, wie Donald Trump spricht. Über weite Strecken verfällt er in einen murmelnden, manchmal geistesabwesend wirkenden Sound, viele seiner Gäste wirken kaum inspirierter; wer immer am Studiopult saß, um den Stimmklang zu mischen, scheint über dieser Aufgabe zwischenzeitig verzweifelt oder weggedämmert zu sein, so beliebig unpoliert, gelegentlich sinnlos verzerrt wirkt das Ergebnis. Und abgesehen von dem Daft-Punk-artig aus einer gestotterten Silbe herausgebildeten Dancefloor-Stück Paid wirken die oft spannungslos unter dem Sprechgesang vor sich hin tuckernden Beats wie aus einem besonders billigen Software-Katalog in den Mulm hineinkopiert. Die beste Sprechgesangspassage gibt es in dem Stück Talking, sie wird von Kanye Wests zehnjähriger Tochter North vorgetragen, die in fabelhaftem Flow mit leicht kehliger, gleichsam kindlicher und keinen Widerspruch duldender Intonation ihre Hörer und Hörerinnen dazu auffordert, sie zu segnen, während unter ihr ein Schnipsel aus einer gegrölten Cheerleader-Hymne mit der zarten, fast körperlos wirkenden Stimme des britischen Elektronik-Soul-Avantgardisten James Blake zu einer Klangschlaufe verflochten wird – die sich wiederum so lange in sich selbst dreht, bis der Rapper Ty Dolla $ign zu einem stotternd gesampelten Gospel-Chor aus voller Brust die Erwartung schmettert, dass die Wolken sich nun bald ballen werden, um zu zeigen, was sie verbergen. Das ist vieles, es ist verwirrend, bizarr und ergreifend, man könnte auch sagen: Es ist große Kunst. An solchen Stellen erhält man zumindest die Ahnung einer Antwort darauf, warum man sich nach all den Jahren immer noch durch das Elend dieses Albums wühlt, um etwas zu finden, das an die einstige Größe Kanye Wests erinnert.""How I'm antisemitic / I just fucked a Jewish bitch"", rappt er in dem Titelstück Vultures, und da denkt man, dass die Lebenszeichen in diesem Klangschutt inzwischen doch so schwach sind, dass man die Suche einstellen kann.",2024-02-13T11:34:55Z,https://www.zeit.de,ZEIT ONLINE
Kanye West Hints at Improper NSFW Italy Boat Trip With Wife Bianca Censori in Latest Song’s Lyrics,"The eagerly awaited release of Kanye West's latest album, Vultures, has finally happened, much to the satisfaction of his devoted fan base. Even though the album contains several cryptic lyrics that fans are busy deciphering, one particular stanza has generated a lot of buzz online. Kanye teases in these lines - a boat excursion he and his wife, Bianca Censori took in Italy, piquing fans' interests and raising quite a few eyebrows!
In the song F-k Sumn, featuring Ty Dolla $ign, the Grammy winner raps, ""Shawty wanna f-k on somethin'? / F-k on me / Suck on me, publicly."" The song has suggestive lyrics that allude to West and Censori's August 2023 inappropriate and racy trip to Italy, per PageSix.

The 16 tracks on the collaborative album that Ty and the Donda emcee worked on together were released on February 9. The album cover had Ye, dressed entirely in black and donning his trademark Jason Voorhees mask, standing behind Censori, who wed Ye in December 2022, who was completely nude and just had a piece of fabric over her butt.
The 46-year-old All of the Lights rapper was captured with his pants down while on a boat ride around Venice's famous canals in August 2023, during the aforementioned trip, with his 29-year-old wife standing in front of him. It's unclear what was going on, but during the ride, Ye's butt was visible. West and Censori were barred from the Venetian boat business for their behavior after images from the boat ride made headlines.
The father of four and the architect would ""no longer be welcome"" on any of Venezia Turismo Motoscafi's boats, the company that rented the boat to the couple, informed Daily Mail Australia in September of last year. The business asserted that until the images were made public, its staff members were ""completely unaware"" that West had been naked on their boat.
“The driver had to keep a lookout for traffic and did not see these obscenities,” the company said. “If this had happened, he would have immediately disembarked and reported the transgressors to those in authority.”
With a statement stating, “We completely dissociate ourselves from such acts and behavior,” Venezia Turismo Motoscafi further denounced the incident. “Mr. West and his wife will certainly no longer be welcome on board our company’s boats.”
According to reports, the two were also under investigation by the local police for potentially violating “standards of public decorum” during the boat ride. The Daily Mail was informed at the time by a police source that the driver of the boat would be questioned. “The images show the couple clearly in a state of intimacy, and if the local prosecutor decides to press charges, then we will notify the couple, most probably through the relevant Embassies,” the insider told the outlet, claiming they'd reportedly received “complaints from people who witnessed” the alleged nudity.",2024-02-13T10:30:28Z,https://www.inquisitr.com,The Inquisitr
Yeezy: Kanye West verkauft alles für 18 Franken,"Er hatte es schon angekündigt, jetzt macht Kanye West Ernst: Auf der Website seiner Brand Yeezy senkt er die Preise aller Produkte auf 18 Franken.
Preissturz : Kanye West verkauft auf seiner Website alles für 18 Franken
Rapper und Designer Kanye West verkauft auf der Website seiner Brand Yeezy alles für 18 Franken.
Am 9. Februar veröffentlichte Kanye West sein erstes Album seit drei Jahren, eine Woche später setzt er – so West in einem Video – «ein Zeichen gegen Klassismus»: Auf der Website seiner Brand Yeezy senkt der Skandal-Rapper am 13. Februar die Preise aller Produkte auf 20 Dollar in den USA respektive 18 Franken, wenn man die Seite in der Schweiz öffnet. Darin eingeschlossen sind auch die bereits ausverkauften Yeezy Pods – das erste Paar Schuhe, das West seit der Trennung von Adidas auf den Markt gebracht hat.
Shirts und Tops kosten auf der offiziellen Website von Yeezy 18 Franken, in die Schweiz bestellen kann man die Teile allerdings nicht. 20 Minuten/Malin Mueller
Allerdings: Auch wenn die Preise auf der Website in Franken angegeben werden – etwas in die Schweiz liefern lassen kann man direkt bei Yeezy nicht.
Würdest du dir etwas auf der Website bestellen? Auf jeden Fall, ich bin schon dabei – ich komme irgendwie daran. Ja, wenn man die Sachen in die Schweiz bestellen könnte. Nein, nicht mal für 20 Franken. Nein, mir sind die Sachen egal.
Faltbare Socken-Schuhe für 200 Dollar
Noch einen Tag zuvor wurden die faltbaren Modelle, die eher an Socken erinnern, für 200 Dollar (umgerechnet ca. 176 Franken) verkauft. In seiner Story teilt die Brand, dass Käufer sich beim Customer Service melden sollen, um 180 Dollar (umgerechnet 158 Franken) zurückzuerhalten.
Die Anzahl der Nachrichten dürfte beträchtlich sein: Zeitgleich mit dem Preissturz teilt West den Screenshot einer Nachricht, in der steht, dass er an einem Tag mehr als 19 Millionen Dollar verdient hat. Unter anderem, weil er 266'000 Paar Schuhe an den Mann oder die Frau brachte.
20 Dollar waren geplant
Die Billig-Aktion kommt nicht komplett überraschend, der Rapper hatte in der Vergangenheit schon Ähnliches vor. Im Rahmen einer Kollaboration mit Balenciaga und Gap versuchte er laut eigener Aussage, die Preise für Hoodies und Shirts auf den gleichen Betrag zu drücken. «Gap hat die Preise nicht auf 20 Dollar gesenkt, so wie ich es verlangt hatte. Sie versuchen immer noch, den Klassismus aufrechtzuerhalten, der hinter der Idee von Balenciaga und der Idee von Gap steht.» Später im Interview bezeichnet er sich als Robin Hood. Mit dem Kommentar «Yeezy for the People», also «Yeezy für jedermann», teilt West im nächsten Post wohl daher ein Bild von der Zeichentrick-Version der Figur.
In der Vergangenheit hatte sich West mehrmals antisemitisch geäussert. In der Show des rechtsextremen US-Radiomachers Alex Jones (49) erklärte der Rapper im Dezember 2022 etwa: «Ich liebe auch Nazis» und «Ich mag Hitler», das könnten ihm Juden nicht verbieten.",2024-02-13T09:29:56Z,https://www.20min.ch,20 Minuten
"""Man Up Lil Boy"": Shaquille O'Neal Claps Back at Kanye West Hours After Being Ignored at Super Bowl","Shaquille O’Neal started his music career in 1993 with ‘Shaq Diesel’. His debut album would receive platinum certification a year later. But despite his highly acclaimed music career and Hall of Fame basketball resume, Shaq often makes time for his peers and fans. While the gentle giant’s wish to meet Grammy winner Taylor Swift came true this weekend, there was one thing about Super Bowl night that bothered him. After being ignored by famed rapper Kanye West at the 2024 Super Bowl, Big Diesel didn’t use kind words to respond. The disrespect didn’t sit well with the 4x NBA champion given his previous clashes with West.

This is not the first time O’Neal lashed out at the rapper. Known for his unabashed honesty, the Los Angeles Lakers legend doesn’t shy away from firing back when provoked. While that could be seen in his latest response to Ye, previously, the Big Aristotle had opted for a “classy” approach to retaliate to the rapper’s verbal jousting.

Shaquille O’Neal thinks Kanye West is a narcissist
The 2000 NBA MVP and Kanye West have been in another spat previously. Despite the feud, O’Neal appreciates West’s work. However, he isn’t very happy about West’s “narcissistic” gesture. Back in 2022, the duo got entangled in each other’s dealings. It all began with Kyrie Irving’s controversial movie commentary. Speaking on the matter, Shaquille O’Neal legend even called the player “stupid.“

Kanye West was also involved in the rumors of such controversy and even dropped by brands for it. Seizing the opportunity, Ye quickly commented how O’Neal’s comment was to bolster his business endeavors. Instead of just clapping back, O’Neal also sharply stated in his response, “Have a great day brother.” Later, Shaq shared, “I’m a little bit narcissistic.” About West, O’Neal said, “On a scale of 1 to 10, I’m probably a 2, [West] is an 8 or 9. A lot of people just can’t take accountability. He threw it all away being arrogant and cocky, so now he wants to throw everybody else’s business dealings under the bus?”

Recension: Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign - ”Vultures 1”,"Som vanligt när det gäller Kanye West har det nya albumet, ett samarbete med rapparen och sångaren Ty Dolla Sign, kantats av kontroverser. Det började redan för ett par månader sedan med det först utlysta omslaget, omskrivet i media för att det bestod av en målning av Caspar David Friedrich (en av romantikens viktigaste konstnärer, men också en av Hitlers favoriter) och med en albumtitel skriven i samma typsnitt som det norska black metal-bandet Burzums logotyp (grundat av den morddömda nynazisten Varg Vikernes).
Om man vill lägga någon större vikt vid detta – det handlar trots allt om ett rätt vanligt typsnitt och en av Tysklands mest kända konstnärer, verksam långt innan Hitler ens var påtänkt – kan man ju göra det. Den bild som till slut fick pryda omslaget har inte heller gått obemärkt förbi. Här står Kanye i heltäckande svart klädsel och mask medan hustrun Bianca Censori står avklädd vänd med ryggen mot kameran.
ANNONS
Dessutom har Ozzy Osbourne såväl som Donna Summers familj vägrat gå med på att låta honom sampla deras verk på skivan. Enligt den gamle Black Sabbath-sångaren på grund av att Kanye West ”är antisemit”.
I stället trollar och skojar han om det, eller skryter om att han fortfarande är stenrik.
Kanye själv bad om ursäkt för tidigare antisemitiska uttalanden i december. Men på ”Vultures 1” återfinns ingen direkt ånger kring dessa. I stället trollar och skojar han om det, eller skryter om att han fortfarande är stenrik trots alla brutna kontrakt med bolag som Adidas och Balenciaga.
På titelspåret lägger han raden ”How I’m anti-semitic? I just fucked a jewish bitch”, vilket möjligen är en blinkning till brittiska Central Cees ”How can I be homofobic? My bitch is gay” men som inte är i närheten av lika kul. I avslutande ”King” förkunnar han att han fortfarande är ”the king” trots att han beskrivits som ”crazy, bipolar, antisemite”. Med ”Carnival” har han redan skapat ännu en skandal då han likställer sig med dömda förövare som R.Kelly och Bill Cosby.
Rent textmässigt är han kanske inte i sin bästa form och vi får inte heller möta den personliga Kanye som på mastodontlånga ”Donda” 2021. Med några undantag. ”Keys to life” där han tycks jämföra exfrun Kim Kardashian med sin älskade, bortgångna mamma. ”Beg forgiveness” där han vill försäkra sig om att hans barn mår bra när han dör. Och så den enkla men fina poplåten ”Good (don’t die)” där han och Ty Dolla Sign sjunger om rädslan för att förlora någon. Annars är det mest självhävdelse och sex.
ANNONS
Annars är det mest självhävdelse och sex.
Det som snarare gör ”Vultures 1” värd att lyssna på är att den visar på Kanyes styrkor som producent. Ljudbilden är ömsom kaotisk och rå, ömsom soft och varm. ”Hoodrat” är ett exempel på det första med en monoton, störig röst som upprepar låttiteln om och om igen. Den stråksamplande ”Burn” däremot är soulig och tidlös och hade lätt kunnat vara med på debuten ”College dropout” för 20 år sedan.
”Paid"" är en fartfylld partylåt med medryckande basgångar, ”Carnival” en arena-banger med sina läktarkörer och ”Paperwork” innehåller en skorrande, distig syntslinga som är helt ljuvlig.
Det är inte särskilt sammanhängande och inte alltid behaglig lyssning, men ständigt överraskande och just därför ett nöje att ta del av.
Klart är också att Ty Dolla Sign kompletterar honom utmärkt med sina mjuka r’n’b-melodier. På låten ”Talking” (där också Kanyes dotter North West gästar) ger han oss en sårbar vers om oron för sin 19-åriga dotter:
”She just doing all the shit I did when I was her age / I don't know how I'm gonna tell her, but her dad's just afraid.”
I övrigt är det kanske Freddie Gibbs som gör det mest minnesvärda inhoppet på den långa gästlistan när han stjäl strålkastarljuset på ”Back to me”.
ANNONS
Nu väntar både en andra och en tredje volym av ”Vultures”-projektet i mars respektive april, om Kanye och Ty lyckas hålla sig till planen. Innehåller dessa bara lite mer självreflektion från Mr West – även om så troligen inte blir fallet – skulle det kunna bli ganska bra.

Kanye West asegura que él no puede ser cancelado y explica sus razones,"Kanye West parece tener claro que es por todo lo que pone de sí mismo en su trabajo por lo que todavía no ha sido cancelado del todo y ni sus comentarios antisemitas ni el trato vejatorio hacia su esposa, Bianca Censori, que tanto revuelo causan en redes, pueden con su imagen pública.
Ye aterrizó este pasado lunes en el aeropuerto de Los Ángeles y allí contestó las preguntas de un reportero del portal de noticias TMZ. Para empezar, se vanaglorió de su último trabajo, Vultures, así como de un exitoso anuncio que vio la luz durante la retransmisión de la Super Bowl.
""Ganamos, ganamos, ganamos. Número uno en todo el mundo. El público siempre lo quiso"", ha declarado el músico de 46 años, que además ha arremetido contra las empresas que ""siempre se interponían con sus precios"" a la hora de hablar de su exitoso anuncio, con el que ha ganado cerca de 20 millones de dólares en 24 horas. Según Kanye, fue él quien decidió abandonar a dichas compañías.
Inmediatamente después, ha declarado: “Voy a ser sincero con todos ustedes. Estuve a dos meses de declararme en bancarrota. Pero puse todo lo que tenía en ello. Nos mudamos a Italia, nos fuimos a las fábricas y hemos sobrevivido. Sobrevivimos a la cancelación. Volvemos al número uno"".
En ese momento, el reportero le pregunta si cree que sus polémicas le han ""ayudado"" a vencer la posible quiebra, Kanye afirma que ""no se trataba de la controversia, se trataba de la capacidad de decir en voz alta cómo se siente cada uno"". ""Y si yo no tuviera mis diversas habilidades musicales, la ropa y una base de fans, habrían podido destruirme. Pero, debido a todas esas habilidades, de alguna forma sigo aquí, dentro de este universo, capaz de luchar"", ha agregado.
A continuación, el músico ha señalado que cree de gran ayuda que su música fuera prohibida por algunas plataformas de streaming: ""Todo lo que hicieron solo nos ayudó. Me gusta que nos echaran. Me gusta la simplificación. De todos modos, las plataformas son una tontería para los artistas. Spotify nos daría 500 millones de dólares entre todos y diría: 'Resuélvanlo entre ustedes'. Yo dije: 'Bueno, ¿qué pasa con Adele? ¿Qué pasa con Drake? ¿Qué pasa con The Weeknd? ¿Qué pasa con Taylor Swift? ¿Qué hay de mí?'. Y ellos que no, que no y que no. Que no importa cuánto seamos escuchados cada uno, que tenemos que calcular esos 500 millones entre todos"".
A continuación da una agradecimiento a sus seguidores, que siempre le apoyan según él por hablar sin pelos en la lengua y decir lo que se le ocurra. De hecho, en este punto se le ha sacado a la luz sus palabras antisemitas y Kanye ha dado una disertación sobre cómo, a pesar de que se disculpó, todavía siguen atacándole por ello, por lo que ahora se disculpa a medias.
""Ellos tienen derecho a su opinión; yo tengo derecho a mi opinión"", ha afirmado el rapero, que en un momento dado defiende que ""las personas negras no pueden ser antisemitas"" y que si a alguien le pide perdón es a los niños judíos, porque tuvieron que escuchar una ""conversación de adultos"".",2024-02-13T08:34:52Z,https://www.20minutos.es,20 Minutos
Declan McKenna On Track For First No. 1,"Declan McKenna is the frontrunner for the U.K. albums chart title with What Happened To The Beach? (via Columbia), this third album.
What Happened To The Beach? leads the midweek chart, and, should it hold its position, would give the English singer-songwriter his first leader.
Whatever happens when the weekly chart is published later in the week, McKenna will have a third top 40 to his name. His 2017 debut LP What Do You Think About The Car? peaked at No. 11, and his sophomore effort from 2020, Zeros, came in at No. 2. On that occasion, the Official Charts Company notes, the Rolling Stones’ reissue of Goats Head Soup scraped through by just 800 chart units for an historic No. 1.
The nearest competitor on the current chart blast is Noah Kahan and his breakthrough third album Stick Season (Republic Records), which is roughly 3,000 combined units behind in second place – its peak position.
Stick Season’s ongoing success is fueled by the release of an expanded deluxe edition, featuring new tracks and collaborations with the likes of Sam Fender, Post Malone, Kacey Musgraves and Hozier, and, of course, its hit title track, which has led the Official U.K. Singles Chart for the past six weeks.
If there were any questions about Kanye West’s international popularity after his recent controversies, the U.K. albums chart could provide an answer. West’s collaborative album Vultures 1 (YZY) with Ty Dolla $ign finally dropped Saturday (Feb. 10), following months of delays. Based on midweek sales and streaming data, Vultures 1 is likely to swoop in at No. 3 for what would Ye’s eighth U.K. top 10 album and Ty Dolla $ign’s first.
Former Mercury Prize-winning British rapper Dizzee Rascal is eyeing a top 10 debut (and sixth overall) with Don’t Take It Personal (Big Dirte3), new at No. 6 on the Official Chart Update, while Swedish pop singer and songwriter Zara Larsson’s third album Venus (Black Butter/Sommer House) is on track for a No. 7 start, for what would be her second top 10 effort.
Meanwhile, Usher could score a top 10 touchdown following his halftime performance at the Super Bowl. The newly-married R&B star’s Coming Home (Mega Gamma) is new at No. 9 on the midweek chart and is set to become the U.S. artist’s seventh top 10 album.
Finally, Somerset, England originated prog-rock act Pineapple Thief is set to steal a career high and second top 40 appearance with It Leads To This (Kscope), new at No. 21 on the midweek tally, while Il Divo’s XX (Il Divo Music) could become the classical crossover act’s 12th Official Albums Chart top 40 appearance. It’s new at No. 35 on the chart blast.
All will be revealed when the Official U.K. Albums Chart is published late Friday, Jan. 16.",2024-02-13T06:19:05Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Plus qu’un vautour,"Kanye West n’a jamais enlevé son masque lors de la séance d’écoute de Vultures 1 à l’UBS Arena, à New York, le 10 février.
Les sorties d’album de Kanye West se suivent et se ressemblent. Controverses, délais, changements de dernière minute. Bref, elles sont chaotiques. Vultures 1, lancé samedi, ne fait pas exception.
Vingt ans après College Dropout
Ce n’était assurément pas le plan initial, considérant les mois de report, mais Vultures 1 a finalement paru 20 ans jour pour jour après College Dropout, premier album de l’artiste de Chicago qui a fait de lui l’un des plus novateurs de sa génération. À mesure que son génie musical s’est déployé, ses frasques se sont toutefois multipliées.
Lui qui n’en était pas à sa première remarque antisémite a commis ce qui est possiblement sa plus grande offense en octobre 2022 en publiant un tweet mentionnant qu’il passait en « death con 3 » pour illustrer son état d’alerte par rapport à la « menace juive ». Dans les semaines qui ont suivi, Adidas a mis fin à sa collaboration avec celui qui est aussi designer pour sa collection Yeezy. West n’a d’ailleurs pas de maison de disques pour appuyer cette dernière offrande et semble peiner à trouver des endroits pour accueillir ses prochains spectacles.
Désolé, votre navigateur ne supporte pas les videos
Il a exprimé des regrets avec maladresse à plus d’une reprise. Le plus récent exemple peut être entendu sur Vultures, premier extrait avec Bump J et Lil Durk offert en trois versions sur un microalbum lancé quelques jours plus tôt : « How I’m Antisemitic ? I just fucked a Jewish bitch. » Afin que l’on comprenne bien l’incompatibilité de ses valeurs et de ses actions, le beat s’arrête à l’instant où West les explique…
L’apport salutaire de Ty Dolla $ign
On n’a mentionné que Kanye jusqu’ici, mais Vultures 1 est également l’œuvre de Ty Dolla $ign. Prolifique auteur-compositeur-interprète de Los Angeles, Ty ajoute beauté et mélodie au disque de 16 morceaux. Ses paroles ne sont pas exemptes de vulgarité et de superficialité, mais elles sont chantées avec assez de justesse et d’âme pour élever l’album dans son ensemble.
Extrait de Burn, de Kanye West et Ty Dolla $ign 0:00 0:00 Couper le son
Burn, qui sonne comme du « vieux Kanye », bénéficie particulièrement de l’apport de Ty Dolla $ign. Son refrain est accrocheur et lumineux. La chanson rappelle à quel point West excelle dans l’intégration d’éléments soul à ses compositions. Alors qu’il échantillonnait des morceaux du genre par le passé, il utilise ici la voix de son collaborateur, qui se démarque aussi sur Do It et Problematic.
Encore beaucoup d’amis… et de nouveaux ennemis
À en juger par la liste d’artistes qui ont contribué à Vultures 1, Kanye West n’a pas épuisé toutes ses amitiés. Du côté des musiciens, notons la participation de Timbaland, James Blake – de façon très évidente sur Talking –, No I.D., 88-Keys, JPEGMafia et Christian.
Extrait de Carnival, de Kanye West et Ty Dolla $ign 0:00 0:00 Couper le son
Le mandat en studio semble avoir été de créer de gros succès pouvant électriser les foules. On en entend littéralement une scander le refrain sur Carnival. Dans sa première version, jouée lors de séances d’écoute publiques, celle-ci incluait un échantillon d’Iron Man, de Black Sabbath. Vendredi, le leader du groupe, Ozzy Osbourne, a écrit sur X que West avait demandé la permission pour l’utilisation du classique métal, mais qu’elle lui avait été refusée « parce qu’il est antisémite ». La femme et gérante du chanteur, Sharon, a menacé de poursuivre Ye, et Iron Man n’apparaît pas sur Vultures 1.
Good (Don’t Die) comprend une réinterprétation du succès I Feel Love de Donna Summer, qui n’a pas non plus été autorisée par les ayants droit du catalogue de la regrettée reine du disco. J. Rey Soul chante à la place de cette dernière, mais il s’agirait tout de même d’une violation de droits d’auteur.
On retrouve également au micro sur Vultures 1 Freddie Gibbs, qui livre un couplet bien acerbe sur Back to Me – on imagine bien le sourire de Kanye en l’écoutant –, Travis Scott, Playboi Carti, Quavo, Chris Brown, YG et North, la fille de West, qui rappe sur Talking.
Du bon malgré tout
Il n’y a pas que rimes douteuses et emprunts clandestins sur cet album de Kanye West et de Ty Dolla $ign. Il est franchement plus digeste que Donda. Stars est une intro puissante qui rappelle Ultralight Beam sur The Life of Pablo. Paid fait hocher de la tête de manière incontrôlable. L’extrait du film Dogma dans Back to Me est hilarant. Le beat de Do It, qui devient celui de Back That Azz Up de Juvenile, nous ramène en 1998 un court instant.

En dépit de quelques bons moments, force est d’admettre qu’on n’arrive pas à apprécier ceux-ci pleinement en raison du personnage que Kanye West est devenu au fil des années. On ne ferme pas les yeux de la même façon sur sa misogynie par rapport à celle d’autres artistes. Son humour noir fait rire jaune. Et l’étalage de ses étiquettes sur King – Crazy, bipolar, antisemite/And I’m still king – n’inspire de notre part aucune empathie. Que va-t-il dire de plus sur les deux autres Vultures prévus ?",2024-02-13T06:11:06Z,https://www.lapresse.ca,La Presse
Kanye West Wore an Eerie 'Jesus Mask' Covering His Entire Face at Super Bowl with Bianca Censori,"Kanye West is known for flaunting his unique and swagger-fueled sense of fashion that continues to redefine the bounds of the clothing industry. Whether it's oversized jackets or chunky boots, West can rock any look! Lately, he’s been sporting rather concealing ensembles that contradict his wife Bianca Censori’s rather revealing attire. For instance, he’s been donning many masks that don’t cover just his mouth but also his entire face, including his forehead, which is rather an unusual feat for the rapper. Nonetheless, he’s bougie and very much in-trend. For this year’s Super Bowl, all eyes were on West and his elusive mask alongside his awkward run-in with his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.

According to The U.S. Sun, West made quite a buzz with his appearance at this year's highly anticipated Super Bowl, which saw Usher deliver a sensational and unforgettable performance. West, being West, once more made a statement via his clothes. On his Instagram, West posted a brief video of him in front of the camera amid what seems to be the ongoing game between Kansas City Chiefs and The 49ers.

Just as West was flaunting his Alexander McQueen Jesus Mask [as his caption claimed], the audio revealed the Chiefs taking their first timeout. Circling back to the rather eerie mask, although West’s face was already covered with a black near-opaque hosiery mask, another edgy one with an apparent white figurine of Jesus extended from his forehead to the bridge of his nose, as per Page Six. West remained mum throughout the video.

The Flashing Lights rapper was joined by Censori as they watched the game together in Las Vegas. Also present was ex-wife Kardashian, who was joined by her sister, Khloe Kardashian, in the arena, close to where West and his wife were being seated. The two seemed to have taken notice of each other, but there was reportedly no drama between them. The husband and wife simply came, enjoyed a successful and well-deserved win by the Chiefs, and left.

The Kardashian sisters, on the other hand, did hang out for a bit and took their leave shortly after. While there’s no altercation now, their peaceful demeanor in public prompts a possibly important question: Is there peace between West and Kardashian since things have been quiet lately between them? Or is this the calm before the storm? Well, that remains debatable. For now, both of them are focused on their endeavors and amicably co-parenting their four children.

West recently released his highly-anticipated album Vultures, featuring his oldest daughter, North West. She made quite a splash on the internet [possibly breaking it in a good way] with her impressive rap skills. This could potentially mark the genesis of North’s career in the music industry.

Kanye West claimed he was two months from declaring bankruptcy after he was “canceled” for his antisemitic remarks.
The “Heartless” rapper raved to TMZ about the success of his new album, “Vultures,” and his Yeezy Super Bowl commercial — over a year after being dropped by multiple brands for his controversial rhetoric.
“Number one all over the world,” West told the outlet Monday at LAX Airport after returning from the big game in Las Vegas.
“I’ma just be honest with y’all. I was two months from going bankrupt, and I put everything I had into it,” he continued.
“We moved to Italy. We moved to the factories, and we survived. We survived through the cancellation. We’re back No. 1.”

The 24-time Grammy winner, 46, went on to credit his “various skill sets” for his ability to overcome the backlash.

“If I didn’t have the various skill sets of music and clothing and the fanbase, they would have been able to destroy me,” he said.
“But because we had all those skill sets, somehow I’m here inside of this universe able to fight.”

When asked if he regretted his past antisemitic comments, West refused to express remorse.
“They got the right to their opinion — I got the right to my opinion,” he said.

Last week, the “All Falls Down” rapper came under fire yet again for referring to himself as an “antisemite” on his new album, “Vultures.”
The livestream for his listening party was temporarily disabled after West — who was wearing a Jason Voorhees mask — debuted the track for the packed audience at the United Center in Chicago.

Kanye West Defends Racy Posts of Wife Bianca Censori: Video,"Kanye West isn’t sorry for sharing videos of his wife, Bianca Censori, 29, partying in next to nothing at a Super Bowl after-party on February 12. After fan backlash over Bianca in the tan bodysuit with massive side cutouts, the rapper shared an angry video with followers on Monday evening, sneering through his new set of titanium teeth as he walked through an airport with her. “Y’all, I just want to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose,” he said, as Bianca, wearing a see-through white shorts bodysuit, giggled.
“So what I’m saying is, I delivered the album,” he said of his Feb. 9 Vultures album drop with Ty Dolla $ign. “And people still in my comments talking ’bout, ‘Why you posting your wife?’ Cause she makes me happy. That’s why y’all happy with the music because I’m happy. You understand?”
“So don’t ever say nothing negative,” he ranted. “If you don’t like my page and don’t like what I’m posting, go f*** yourself. Seriously, leave me, leave the king, the f*** alone. I don’t care bro. I’m going to post my wife as much as I want. Go post your wife on your f***ing Instagram,” he said.
He took to the caption to continue. “Ima post my wife as much as I want bro It makes me happy Some people don’t want you to be happy They want you to make them happy I decided to make myself happy and I’m happy with that,” he wrote.
The video in question — inexplicably shared three times in a row earlier on Monday, showed Bianca looking gorgeous in the skin-baring getup with influencer Indialove Westbrooks. “STILL THE KING,” he captioned all three of the identical clips.
Kanye, who shares four children with ex-wife Kim Kardashian, secretly married Bianca in January of 2023, though many had speculated the marriage wasn’t legally binding. “Kanye and Bianca were legally married last year when they had their private ceremony in Beverly Hills, it was real and legal,” a source told Us Weekly in October.",2024-02-13T03:42:20Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
Inside Kanye West's 'chaotic' Vegas listening party including last-minute lowered ticket prices and fights between fans,"KANYE West hosted a chaotic listening party following the Super Bowl which saw him lower ticket prices last minute - despite dozens of fans shelling out $350 to see the controversial star.
The performance at a new unnamed tent venue on the Las Vegas Strip resembled an underground rave and was organized just 24 hours before.

Exclusive video footage obtained by The U.S. Sun also shows fights breaking out between fans as drinks were hurled, punches were thrown and partygoers were escorted out by security.
Kanye was joined on stage by 10-year-old daughter North West and rapper Ty Dollar $ign as they danced along to their new album, Vultures, in front of thousands of fans.
The 46-year-old rapper was supported by his wife Bianca Censori who was seen in the VIP section.
He announced the gig, billed 'Ye & Friends', earlier in the day on Instagram with tickets priced at $350 with an open bar, $750 for a VIP balcony, and $25,000 for a balcony table.
But later in the afternoon, the ticket price suddenly dropped to $150, with many fans left feeling cheated having already paid the higher price to see the rapper.
Kanye was set to go on stage at 11 pm but didn't step out until midnight, and never spoke a word as he danced around with North and guests while his album played.
FAN COMPLAINTS
An insider told The U.S. Sun staff were asked to work the event just 24 hours before and the show was ""pretty unorganized.""
The main floor of the venue was sectioned off - meaning fans were penned in around the sides and could barely see the stage, as Kanye ""specifically asked for space.""
Staff were seen telling guests they could not use professional cameras at the show, while Kanye had a huge team of videographers roaming about getting content.
He moved around the stage in all black and a mask to all of his tracks from Vultures, including Paid, Everybody, Back To Me, and North West's song Talking.

Despite the ticket situation, there were many diehard supporters seen chanting ""Yeezy"" and dancing as security was seen escorting VIP guests to different sections.
But after the show finished, two big fights broke out and fans were seen being pulled out of the venue.
Crowds of people were also seen arguing with security as they struggled to exit the venue without walking a long distance to the other side of the Strip.
KIM IN TOWN
One partygoer said, ""While a lot of loyal fans enjoyed the show, it was disheartening that he never said a single word on stage when the ticket price was so high.
""It was obvious it was organized very last minute and nobody knew what to expect. It was classic Kanye, I'm surprised he didn't come on at 2 am.""
North was brought on for several tracks before leaving the stage and was likely brought to Vegas by mom Kim Kardashian, who was also in town for the Super Bowl.
She was seen partying with sisters Khloe and Kendall along with new beau Odell Beckham Jr at the Fanatics Party at the Marquee Dayclub at The Cosmopolitan on Saturday.
Although Kim and Odell kept a distance at the event, The U.S Sun published exclusive photographs of the pair arriving back at The Wynn Hotel after the bash.
According to In Touch Weekly, they have been secretly dating each other since July 2023, when they both went to a Hamptons party hosted by billionaire Michael Rubin.

Kanye West told people to “go f–k” themselves after he was slammed for uploading risqué videos of his wife, Bianca Censori, wearing a barely-there bodysuit at a Super Bowl 2024 party to his Instagram.
On Monday, the rapper-turned-fashion designer posted the same video of his wife three times, which had people scratching their heads.
The comments seemingly didn’t sit well with West, who then uploaded yet another Instagram video, where he hit back at the haters.
“Y’all, I just want to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose,” he told the camera while he and Censori — who was wearing yet another revealing outfit — walked through an airport.
“So what I’m saying is, I delivered the album. And people still in my comments talking ’bout, ‘Why you posting your wife?'” he continued, referring to his and Ty Dolla $ign’s 18-track album, “Vultures,” which was released Feb. 9.

Censori — who is dressed by West– has also stepped out several times wearing sheer fits and was most recently photographed styling a transparent raincoat with nothing underneath.
Despite her seeming unbothered by the fashion choices, a Daily Mail source previously claimed the Australian beauty needs protection from the disgraced rapper as he keeps “pushing her nakedness.”

'HAVE SOME RESPECT!' Kanye West ‘objectifies’ wife Bianca Censori, fans claim as she dances in nude bodysuit that looks like ‘tablecloth’
BIANCA Censori has been spotted wearing next to nothing while at a crowded party.
On Monday, Bianca, 29, was shown in a video posted by her husband Kanye West, 46, on Instagram.

In the clip, Bianca was wearing a bodysuit that looked like a giant tan thong while in Las Vegas.
It was one singular piece of fabric that came up to her chest in an upside-down triangle with two thin straps keeping it up.
When looking at her side profile, she was flaunting a ton of sideboob and her entire torso was visible.
At one point in the video, she put her hands under her bodysuit to readjust her breasts.
Her short hair was slicked back away from her face, and she didn't appear to be very comfortable in the clip.
While Kanye focused his camera on his wife, he also showed another woman who danced while touching her breasts.
He captioned the post: ""STILL THE KING.""
CORNCHIP COUTURE
In the comment section of the social media post, fans came for Kanye and how his wife was dressed.
One asked: ""Kanye, why is your wife wearing a tablecloth?""
""You’ve been saying for years that your daughter needs better role models yet you do stuff like this.

""Wtf what happened to all the holy talk and church school? So confused,"" asked a critic.
A fifth commented: ""Objectifying your wife like that is not good man.
""I hope one day you get back to being humble and decent. You seem so lost.""
ITALY TRANSGRESSION
Kanye came out with a new album in which he mentioned his wife's former public indecency.
The rapper took Bianca to Venice, Italy, in August 2023.
While there, they took a trip on one of the city's famous water taxis in the canals.
When they were on the water taxi, photos were taken of Kanye who seemingly had his pants down as Bianca appeared to perform a sexual act.
Then, this weekend in his newly released album, Vultures 1, he seemed to confirm those rumors through a song lyric.
In his song F**k Sumn, a lyric said: ""Shawty wanna f**k on something?
""F**k on me. Suck on me publically.""
He performed the song for the first time during his album release party in Chicago on Thursday.
In addition to being an inspiration for lyrics, Bianca also posted practically nude for the album cover.

Kanye West Shows Off His Alexander McQueen Crucifixion Mask,"After some time away and a series of mysterious stories appearing out of Europe, West returned to the US late last year. Since then he's been spotted a lot more often but almost every time he has something covering much of his face. Sometimes that's been the kind of ski masks that he's worn on and off for years. Other times he's stepped out in something closer to a hockey mask. He was in attendance at the Super Bowl this weekend like many other celebs and he matched the special occasion with a special mask.
As soon as West was spotted fans honed in on what he was wearing over his face. He was sporting a black eye mask over top of a black ski mask covering his entire head. Displayed on the eye mask itself is a cut out of Jesus being crucified. The imagery is striking and West took to Instagram to show fans a close-up look at the piece. ""Alexander McQueen Jesus Mask"" he captioned the Instagram post revealing that the piece was from the legendary fashion brand. The video itself features a short black-and-white video close-up of West in the mask. Check out the short clip below.

The project sports a ton of high-profile features that rap fans spent much of the weekend breaking down. Though critics have been pretty harsh on the record fan response has been a bit more mixed.
West has also found himself in hot water for some of the samples used on his new album. Both the estate of Donna Summer and Ozzy Osbourne himself have called him out publicly for using samples that they rejected his request for.

Miller first made a name for himself in the public eye for working with Drake. Amid the Toronto rapper’s feud with Meek Mill, Meek outed Miller as Drake’s ghostwriter. Last year, Miller reflected on that period of his career and revealed he wasn’t properly paid for working on Drake’s 2015 mixtape If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late. “I never got a single publishing check off any songs,” he told VladTV. “I had to feed my family off getting paid under the table in that situation, because Tricky and them wouldn’t let me go, I didn’t get out that deal ’til 2019, 2020; I signed [it in] 2011, I had to let go of a lot of shit just to get out. Even while I was in it, I never got a publishing check or nothing. I was just grinding, bro. I was grinding it out just hoping that one day that one song or working with that one artist is gonna change something — and that was the Drake thing! But it just didn’t change anything.”

Elon Musk Has Cheeky Answer For Kanye West's Rocket Ship Tweet,"Kanye West and Elon Musk share a lot in common as two rich creatives with eclectic tendencies and a whole lot of hate online. Comparisons between them have been very common, and they have a pretty interesting bond that is sometimes friendly and occasionally competitive. Recently, Ye let out a tweet asking the tech tycoon ""where [his] rocket ship"" is at, a reference to his lyric on his new Vultures cut, ""CARNIVAL."" In response, Mr. Musk made a cheeky Nicki Minaj reference, tagging her in the tweet as well. After all, as she reminded us so many years ago during her radio heyday, she has a special connection to space travel.
""Starships were meant to fly [get it, Barbz?] and our next one launches in about 3 weeks,"" Elon Musk responded to Kanye West. ""But I recommend waiting for a few more test flights before hopping on board. @NICKIMINAJ."" As such, this made for a pretty comical crossover moment on social media, and we've yet to see whether the Trinidadian MC will hop on a rocket ship, too. We know that Ye probably will when he gets the chance, and that's one of many notable bars on ""CARNIVAL,"" albeit for very different and much less ""cancelable"" reasons.

Of course, this is far from the only rapper to want in on Elon Musk's empire. But speaking to that point earlier about competition, some MCs think that they can make something even better. For example, Rick Ross recently said that he will prepare really well for the apocalypse, and wants to build an underground bunker that surpasses the 52-year-old's. Hopefully we will never get to see whether Rozay succeeds in this regard, because we would have much bigger problems to worry about.
Meanwhile, the ""Can't Tell Me Nothing"" hitmaker is still basking in the release of his Ty Dolla $ign collab album. With some great surprise features and notable tracks here and there, we imagine that they will continue to build hype for its next installments. Whether they actually come out or the duo makes up for their bigoted rollout is another story. To find that out, stay up to date on HNHH for the latest news and updates on Elon Musk and Kanye West.

Let the Super Bowl partying continue.
Bianca Censori is never one to shy away from jaw-dropping looks, and predictably pushed the envelope while celebrating husband Kanye West’s new album, “Vultures,” at a Las Vegas bash after 2024’s big game.
The Australian model, 29, was seen laughing and dancing in a barely-there bodysuit by Mowalola.
Censori appeared to wear a fur version of the daring open-sided design, which is also available in different colors of leather.
Designer Mowalola Ogunlesi has long been a close collaborator of West’s, with the rapper and his entire family — including daughter North — having worn looks by the Nigerian-born creative.
Kim Kardashian modeled the same square-neck bodysuit with matching leather pants in 2020.
West’s new wife, however, opted not to cover up in any way, wearing the thong one-piece without pants and showing off the major cutouts on the side.

Despite her risqué afterparty ensemble, however, the Yeezy architect bundled up for the big game at Allegiant Stadium, wearing a latex head covering underneath a black windbreaker.

"The Best Features On Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign's ""Vultures""","This past weekend, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign unleashed their debut collaborative album, Vultures 1. After a rocky rollout of listening parties and constant changes, including its release date, the album materialized with 16 tracks and a brand-new cover. Officially titled Vultures 1, Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s full-length collaboration is reportedly the first of three separate volumes, with Part 2 expected to arrive on March 8 and Part 3 on April 5. These dates are to be considered in the context of Kanye’s notable history of delaying album releases. Vultures 1 may be a collaborative album between Kanye and Ty, but the duo also recruited numerous other guests throughout its tracklist. Today, we are ranking the best features on Vultures 1 from least to greatest.
5. “Talking” - North West
Featured on “Talking” is none other than Kanye West’s 10-year-old daughter, North West. She may be young and her appearance on the album is short, but her contributions are better than many other professional recording artists featured on Vultures 1. Her feature is not to be judged like the other musicians on the album, as she is simply having fun on the song. North’s quick verse is cheerful, catchy, and a wholesome moment between her and her father. She even emulates Kanye with her inflections and melodic rapping. Again, North West’s feature is meant to be a lively moment on a song about fatherhood.
“Do It” includes a short posthumous intro from Nipsey Hussle, as well as a guest verse from YG. The Compton native sticks to Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign’s lyrical themes of sex and money but has a moment to shine on his own. A prominent sample of Juvenile’s “Back That Azz Up” gets incorporated into the fast-paced instrumental as YG spits his verse. His West Coast gangsta rap style is perfect for the beat as he skips right across it. The addition of the sample makes his feature more effective, complimenting his flow and lyrics. Also, his and Ty Dolla $ign’s chemistry and deep collaborative history make for a standout moment on Vultures 1.
3. “Paperwork” - Quavo
Quavo has worked with Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign on separate occasions. This time, they recruited the Migos member for “Paperwork,” a bizarre blend of hip hop and Brazilian funk. The production is quite abrasive with its distorted bassline, but Quavo’s auto-tuned melodies and ad-libs cut right through the beat. Out of the three, he sounds the most comfortable over the instrumental, floating over it with a catchy melody. Quavo often sounds great over light and airy production, but on “Paperwork,” he sits right on top of the beat as he provides his signature melodic bars.
Chris Brown is one of the standout features on Vultures 1. He and Kanye previously created magic on ""Waves,"" and he worked with Ty Dolla $ign on tracks like ""Only 4 Me."" “Beg Forgiveness” is a six-minute highlight that allows him to occupy the spotlight alongside Ty. His acapella introduction starts the song on a heartfelt note. Futher, “Beg Forgiveness” builds around Chris Brown’s pitched-down vocals, matching the spacious production. Before Ty tests himself vocally towards the end of the song, Brown occupies the almost first three minutes with a rendition of Joe Goddard’s “Gabriel.” It makes for easily the album’s most soulful and musically compelling moment.
1. “Back To Me” - Freddie Gibbs
By a wide margin, Freddie Gibbs has the best verse on Vultures 1. While Kanye spends most of the song talking about how “beautiful, big t*tty, butt-naked women just don’t fall out the sky,” Gibbs completely reimagines this ridiculous refrain. He makes the song his own, smoothly flowing over the hard-hitting drum break. Freddie repurposes Kanye’s lyrics into a skillfully-crafted verse. He not only sounds good but drops some clever punchlines as well. Gibbs raps, “Just turned a bird b*tch to my ex like I was Elon” and “Standin' at the plate, your ho catchin' balls like a bat catcher.” He even switches his flows and rhyme schemes, impressing as he transitions between each line. Gibbs completely stole the show with his verse on “Back to Me,” outshining every other feature on Vultures 1.

C’è un po’ di Inter nel nuovo album di Kanye West (""Voltures 1""), prodotto in collaborazione con Ty Dolla Sign e uscito lo scorso 8 febbraio. Il popolare e controverso musicista statunitense, che ora si fa chiamare Ye, ha inserito nelle tracce dei brani “Carnival” e “Stars” alcuni cori dei tifosi nerazzurri a San Siro campionati come base. Una scelta assolutamente voluta, se è vero che la Curva Nord viene citata come ‘credit’ in entrambi i brani: “choir vocals” in “Carnival” e “crowd vocals” in “Stars”, sempre insieme a Federico Secondomè e Zlyah.",2024-02-12T19:01:33Z,https://sport.sky.it,Sky Sport
"Kanye West says ‘Vulture’ saved him from cancellation, near bankruptcy","Kanye West issued an apology in Hebrew ahead of the release of his new album ‘Vultures’
Kanye West is grateful to live to fight another day.
Speaking to TMZ about the success of his new album Vultures, the legendary rapper reflected on how he survived his anti-Semitic controversy storm, which, according to him nearly drove him to bankruptcy and the “brink” of cancellation.
Raving over Vultures peaking at “number one all over the world,” Kanye further reflected, “Imma just be honest with y’all. I was two months from going bankrupt, and I put everything I had into it.”
He continued, “We moved to Italy. We moved to the factories, and we survived. We survived through the cancellation. We’re back No. 1.”
The Runaway hitmaker credited his “various skill sets of music and clothing and the fanbase” avoiding being “destroyed.”
“But because we had all those skill sets, somehow I’m here inside of this universe able to fight,” he expressed.
Upon being questioned about his past anti-Semitic comments, for which he previously issued an apology in Hebrew only to dig his grave even deeper, Kanye simply responded, “They got the right to their opinion – I got the right to my opinion.”

Kanye West throws insults to critics over risqué Bianca Censori posts,"Kanye West has a message for the haters.
The legendary rapper finally had enough of people criticising him for posting his wife Bianca Censori so much – particularly in the near-nude – on his social media.
After receiving backlash yet again for recently posting the same video of Bianca three times, Ye silenced the negative comments once and for all in a video posted to his Instagram essentially telling critics to “go f*** yourself.”
“Y’all, I just wanted to tell everybody I posted my wife three times on purpose,” he said as he walked through an airport with Bianca, who was wearing one of her signature bare-all bodysuits.
The Runaway rapper continued, “So what I’m saying is, I delivered the album [Vultures]. And people still in my comments talking ‘bout, ‘Why you posting your wife?’”
To that question, Kanye had but one thing to say: “Cause she makes me happy.”
As he briefly panned the camera to a giggling Bianca, Kanye elaborated that since he’s happy, his fans are happy as they get new music from him.
“So don’t ever say nothing negative. If you don’t like my page and don’t like what I’m posting, go f*** yourself. Seriously, leave me – leave the king – the f*** alone!” he demanded.
He concluded, “I don’t care bro. I’m going to post my wife as much as I want. Go post your wife on your f***ing Instagram.”",2024-02-12T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Bianca Censori Dons Strange & Skimpy Outfit With India Love & Bobby Lytes,"Bianca Censori is know for her wild fashion choices, and at this point, it's a reputation that she has to uphold. Moreover, she wore just a piece of fabric on her chest, held loosely together by some thin strings in a very revealing way, while she was out clubbing with India Love and Bobby Lytes. Overall, it's exactly the kind of steamy and provocative fit that we expect from the architect, and what made her such a ""household name"" in pop culture media. Of course, part of that obsession is also her hyper-famous husband, but either angle is bound to make some headlines pop.
In fact, during the clip below, the entourage listens to the closing track on Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's new album Vultures in the background. It's actually been quite curious to see how Bianca Censori relates to this whole rollout, and it's particularly interesting because of the cover art. Rather than featuring his full-length album collaborator, Ye chose to feature his wife on the cover, who poses alongside him in his Jason Voorhess and black leather look. Maybe the other volumes of this project, which are supposedly coming soon, will feature other covers more indicative of the musical duo and not the married duo.

Bianca Censori's Latest Eye-Catching Fit
Regardless, Bianca Censori's buddy for this night out, India Love, is also stirring up some conversation online. Footage recently emerged online of her recording her vocals for the cut ""KEYS TO MY LIFE"" on Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's first Vultures installment. Again, considering how these rollouts go, we wouldn't bet on those follow-ups coming out, but they seem committed to the idea. A lot of folks wouldn't want India to hop back on, though, as some people clowned this new footage of her recording her contributions.
Meanwhile, the Chicago artist's exploits also got his wife deep in the rap circles, hanging out with the likes of Playboi Carti recently. We'll see if any environment changes provoke a style change, too, but again, she has a reputation to uphold. Where does this rank in the pantheon of absurd fits from the couple?

Kanye West usa tempo milionário da Super Bowl com vídeo caseiro,"O cantor gastou uma pequena fortuna para colocar no ar um anúncio à Yeezy no intervalo da Super Bowl. E usou 29 segundos com um filme caseiro.
Ye, ou Kanye West, sentado no banco de trás de um automóvel, a falar para a câmara de um telemóvel. É assim o anúncio à Yeezy, que foi transmitido no intervalo da Super Bowl.
“Aqui é o Ye e este é o meu anúncio. Uma vez que gastámos todo o dinheiro no spot publicitário, não gastámos dinheiro nenhum no anúncio propriamente dito. Mas a ideia é que quero que vão a Yeezy.com (…), e eu tenho uns sapatos, e hummmm... é isso.”
A simplicidade, que surpreendeu a audiência da Super Bowl, parece ter surtido efeito. “É genial” parece ser uma opinião partilhada por muitos seguidores do rapper, e o anúncio destacou-se entre o conjunto que foi exibido, de marcas como Dunkin’ Donuts, Mountain Dew, Uber Eats e Oreo, que, além dos milhões gastos no tempo de antena, optaram por grandes produções para os seus spots publicitários.
Kanye West não terá desembolsado os 7 milhões de dólares (6,5 milhões de euros) equivalentes a 30 segundos de publicidade durante a transmissão nacional da Super Bowl, uma vez que o anúncio não foi exibido em todo o país, mas apenas em alguns mercados televisivos. Não foi visto em Los Angeles, segundo nota o Hollywood Reporter, nem no Nordeste dos Estados Unidos. Ainda assim, ter-se-á tratado de um investimento avultado.
Certo é que os fãs do também empresário se revelam rendidos pela originalidade. “Este homem é brilhante”, escreve um seguidor no YouTube, onde os comentários vão de “melhor anúncio de sempre” a “isto fez com que comprasse algo no site dele”. Também no X, ex-Twitter, não faltam elogios à ousadia: “Não vi a Superbowl, mas já vi este anúncio três vezes.”",2024-02-12T17:50:45Z,https://www.publico.pt,PÚBLICO
Las referencias de Kanye West a su escándalo sexual en un bote y a Taylor Swift en su nuevo álbum,"Kanye West y Bianca Censori fueron captados en los que pareció ser un encuentro sexual en un bote de Venecia. Ahora, enfrentan las consecuencias Credito:X@DailyviralUS
Durante el verano pasado, el conocido rapero Kanye West y su esposa Bianca Censori, protagonizaron un incidente en Venecia, Italia, que captó la atención de medios y provocó consecuencias inesperadas. Según se reportó, West, de 46 años, fue visto con los pantalones bajados en un paseo en barco por los famosos canales de la ciudad, mientras Censori, de 29 años, se encontraba frente a él. Aunque los detalles exactos del suceso son inciertos, las imágenes que circularon del momento llevaron a que la pareja fuera vetada por la compañía veneciana de motoscafos Venezia Turismo Motoscafi.

Este incidente no solo generó controversia en el momento, sino que ha encontrado un nuevo eco en la cultura popular a través de la música de West. En su reciente álbum Vultures 1, lanzado en colaboración con Ty Dolla $ign, una de las canciones, titulada Fuk Sumn, parece hacer referencia a este episodio con letras provocativas que insinúan la naturaleza pública del acto.

A tan sólo unos días de haber salido a la luz, Vultures 1 ha generado una enorme controversia debido a sus letras explicitas donde, al parecer, Kanye no ha tenido reparo en mencionar los escándalos que han manchado su carrera. Además de su travesura en Italia, West volvió a hablar de Taylor Swift en el tema Carnival, donde asegura que “ha hecho seis Taylor Swift” haciendo referencia a su anterior canción Famous donde aseguraba que él había hecho famosa a la cantante, repitiendo su proeza con cinco artistas más.
“He hecho seis Taylor Swift, (Ha) desde que tenía el Rollie en la muñeca (Ha) / Soy el nuevo Jesús, zorra (Ha), convierto el agua en Cris”, se escucha en Carnival.
Otra tema al que Kanye hace referencia es a sus acusaciones de antisemitismo. El artista presentó una de sus frases más controversiales hasta la fecha en la canción que le da nombre al álbum: “¿Cómo voy a ser antisemita? Acabo de tirarme a una judía”.
Kanye West fue visto junto a Chris Brown cantando un fragmento de la canción ""Vultures"" que ha sido considerado antisemita
A estas letras se le suma una gran cantidad de sampleos a artistas como Ozzy Osbourne que no quieren nada que ver con el cantante, comenzando a pronunciarse en redes para dejar en claro que West no tenía permiso de usar esa música.

En lo que respecta al escándalo de Italia, la empresa Venezia Turismo Motoscafi fue rápida y contundente. Explicaron que sus empleados no estaban al tanto de las acciones de West hasta que las imágenes comenzaron a inundar las redes. Subrayaron que, de haberlo sabido en el momento, habrían detenido el viaje inmediatamente y reportado la conducta de las celebridades. La compañía condenó el comportamiento de West y Censori, asegurando que ya no serían bienvenidos a bordo de sus embarcaciones.

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign - VULTURES 1 album review: a limp attempt at provocation,"West’s more recent albums have been uneven in quality, and often unfinished even upon release, heavily edited and updated in real-time. Though Jesus Is King came with bright gospel production, its declaration of faith felt oddly hollow. 2021’s Donda, an excessive and baggy 27-track thought-dump, did most of its hanging out in the middle of the road. Now, he’s back again with Ty Dolla $ign ‒ the rappers have formed a duo called ¥$, and Vultures 1 marks their debut together. It comes amid mounting controversy surrounding West, who feebly apologised for making a number of incredibly antisemitic comments in the run-up to its release. Elsewhere, he has been dropped by Adidas following various allegations of inappropriate conduct at Yeezy, and no longer has a record label.",2024-02-12T16:24:03Z,https://www.standard.co.uk,Evening Standard

Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai?
While Verizon splashed out a reported $30 million for Beyoncé to star in its splashy Super Bowl 2024 ad (per the Telegraph), Kanye West went in a decidedly different direction for his own commercial, filming it from his cell phone in the backseat of a car.
“Hey y’all, this is Ye and this is my commercial,” he started off the dark, grainy video, flashing his $850,000 custom titanium dentures.
The “Gold Digger” rapper, 46 — who sounds like he’s struggling to speak with his new tooth bling — admitted that because he “spent all the money on the commercial spot” his brand “actually didn’t spend any money on the actual commercial.”
With Super Bowl 2024 commercials running $7 million for a 30-second spot, per the Hollywood Reporter, it seems like Ye didn’t have any cash left for a glossy ad — although the outlet noted that Yeezy’s spot didn’t seem to run in all markets, suggesting he spent less for the commercial.

No matter the cost, he made sure to get his message across.
“But the idea is I want you to go to Yeezy.com,” he continued, spelling out the site’s name and adding, “Imma write it at the bottom of the screen.”
West finished off the bizarre spot by saying, “and I got some shoes, and ummmm… that’s it.”
The controversial singer was referring to his sock-like, foldup Yeezy Pods shoes ($20), with everything on his website now priced at the bargain cost — including the “Wet” tank ($20) his wife, Bianca Censori, sported in recent paparazzi pics and shirts promoting his latest album, “Vultures.”

While his ad was no-budget, West definitely didn’t skimp on his attire for the big game on Sunday, wearing a vintage 1996 Alexander McQueen crucifix mask to attend the Super Bowl with Censori.
February 11 marked the 14th anniversary of the legendary designer’s death, making the mask — which he wore with a black leather jacket, gloves and coordinating pants — a notable choice.
As for his commercial, Twitter users were divided over whether the rapper was spinning his wheels or if his bargain ad was actually “genius.”

"Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, & Chris Brown Are Taking No Prisoners On Epic ""BEG FORGIVENESS""","After a weekend with Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign's collaboration tape VULTURES 1, fans are lukewarm on it. Some say it is an outstanding record, while others do not like how Ye comes across on some of the tracks. One thing that people seem to be collectively agreeing on is the quality of the production. It certainly helps when you have so many creative geniuses coming together like JPEGMAFIA and London On Da Track, for example. They have excellent contributions to ""BEG FORGIVENESS.""
It is one of the few serious moments on the LP, and this may be the strongest of that bunch. When Kanye drops introspective and minimal tracks, they almost always seem to hit differently. If you do not believe us, go listen to ones like ""FML,"" ""Say You Will,"" or ""Come to Life."" Those are just a handful of examples that show him at his best. Ye's verse on ""BEG FORGIVENESS"" is quite touching as he hopes that his children will live amazing lives. Additionally, he talks about his own mortality and that he is comfortable with what he accomplised if he were to perish.

Listen To ""BEG FORGIVENESS"" By Kanye West, Ty Dolla $ign, & Chris Brown
As for Ty and Breezy, they both dig deep and bring emotional performances. Brown delivers expertly written choruses, refrains, and pre-choruses. Ty finishes things up, belting out raspy and powerful lines like, ""Say you wanna make amends before I go / Now you wanna put your heart on the line."" Both R&B talents are feeling resentful and it will send chills down your spine. For ultimate the crescendo, the instrumental feels tribal, epic, and cold in all the right ways. The chants of ""beg forgiveness"" are haunting but beautiful as well. If you are looking for track to pick from this album, try this one out.

Super Bowl 2024 : le look controversé de Kanye West et Bianca Censori fait jaser,"Crédit photo : Cindy Barrymore/Shutterstock
Kanye West ne fait pas dans la dentelle. Le rappeur, ex de Kim Kardashian, est connu et reconnu pour son exatravgance. Aussi bien dans ses propos que dans ses looks toujours plus étonnants et détonnants. Et dernièrement, c’est aux bras de sa femme Bianca Censori que l’artiste a fait une apparition remarquée. Pour cause, cette dernière s’est baladée totalement nue dans les rues de Los Angeles, « vêtue » d’un simple imperméable transparent.
La femme de Kanye West totalement nue dans la rue
Des clichés considérés comme choquants pour de nombreux internautes. Mais également, devenus rapidement viraux sur la toile. Nous pouvons ainsi y voir Bianca Censori, la femme de Kanye West, vêtue d’un simple poncho transparent, recouvrant très légèrement sa poitrine. En revanche, à chaque pas, l’australienne était obligée de cacher ses parties intimes. De son côté, Kanye West ne laissait quant à lui, même pas entrevoir son visage. Une sortie très remarquée qui a beaucoup fait jaser sur la toile. Nous pouvons lire : « Cette photo est terrifiante », « C’est glauque » , « Il l’utilise et il la domine ». Plusieurs internautes insinuent en effet que Kanye West a une très grosse emprise sur la jeune femme, allant jusqu’à la dénuder et la considérer comme une simple poupée.
Le look de Kanye West au Super Bowl 2024 fait jaser
Mais cette petite tenue n’est pas la seule à avoir fait parler d’elle. De fait, alors que de nombreuses stars ont sorti leur plus bel outfit à l’occasion du Super Bowl 2024, du côté de Kanye West, c’est une autre paire de manches. Loin du jogging de Blake Lively à plusieurs milliers de dollars, le rappeur a quant à lui opté pour la… sobriété ? Son visage à nouveau caché, l’interprète de Stronger portait un masque en forme de crucifix signé Alexander McQueen. Un accessoire issue de la collection « Dante » de l’automne 1996. Ce dimanche 11 février était marqué par le Super Bowl, mais également par le 14ème anniversaire de la mort du créateur. Aucun doute donc qu’il a probablement voulu lui rendre hommage en portant ce masque avec un crucifix blanc tridimensionnel. Ce qui n’a pas empêché aux internautes de critiquer son look et gentiment se moquer de lui sur la toile…
Les internautes hilares
Rapidement, les réactions ont fusé sur la toile face au look étonnant et controversé de Kanye West au Super Bowl 2024. Nous pouvons ainsi lire : « Kanye West je t’adore, mais c’est quoi ce masque ? », « Pourquoi il cache son visage partout où il va ? », « Il peut respirer là-dedans ? ». Ou encore : « Il a payé un billet à 10 000 dollars pour le Super Bowl, pour voir le match comme ça », « Pourquoi il se punit lui-même ? », « Il se croit dans Mask Singer ». Visiblement, la tenue de Kanye West en a bien fait rire plus d’un. Quant à Bianca Censori, elle était cette fois-ci, beaucoup plus habillée. Toute de noire vêtue, elle portait également une cagoule sur la tête, laissant cependant apparaître son visage. Un look, qui n’a pas non plus fait l’unanimité auprès des internautes…",2024-02-12T13:44:40Z,https://www.melty.fr,melty
Kanye West Delivers Low-Effort DIY Super Bowl Yeezy Ad,"Kanye West has been doing a lot as of late. Overall, he just dropped his new album Vultures which has finally made its way to all streaming services. Furthermore, he has been trying to bring back his Yeezy brand in full force. Of course, fans loved the Yeezy brand when he was with Adidas. However, he is on his own and has to prove himself as a designer. This has not been easy, but with some promotion here and there, the artist can certainly find new people to mess with his new clothes.
Well, last night he was presented with a phenomenal opportunity. It was the Super Bowl, and a 30-second ad would cost you $7 million. Overall, this is a lot of cash, however, Ye was clearly very interested in making that happen. Why not? Millions of people watch the big game and could be persuaded into buying his shoes. Below, you can find his Super Bowl ad. However, it is clear that he ran out of budget after buying the ad placement. We know this because the ad itself is as low-effort as it gets.

In the clip, Kanye can be found recording a video of himself on his phone. It is here where he states he spent all of his money on the actual ad placement. Subsequently, he urges fans to head over to Yeezy.com where he is selling shoes. Of course, he is talking about his Yeezy Pods which have proven to be extremely controversial due to their bizarre look. Either way, it was a huge look for Kanye, and the DIY aesthetic of the commercial proved to be the perfect viral marketing tactic.
It was a massive Super Bowl, and one that fans will remember for a very long time. You have to hand it to the Chiefs, who were simply fantastic in the big game.

Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign: Vultures 1 review - weak lyrics from a witless edgelord,"Vultures 1 arrives, as it seems all Kanye West albums now must, late and mired and in yet more controversy, the latter now a smouldering heap of self-inflicted ill-feeling that left West without a record label, an estimated $1.5bn poorer after Adidas cut ties with him and, according to a now-deleted post on Instagram, unable to book a tour because venues have blacklisted him, all due to antisemitic comments.
Indeed, this time around, the controversy and the lateness appear to go hand in hand. Vultures’ supporting cast list underlines that there are still plenty of big names happy to be associated with him – from Playboi Carti and Travis Scott to producers Timbaland and James Blake – but at least part of the album’s failure to appear on any of the scheduled release dates seems to be linked to other artists’ refusal to give clearance for guest appearances and samples. If Nicki Minaj’s disinclination to have her feature track on the album was, she said, down to the fact that it was “three years old”, there was little doubt as to why Ozzy Osbourne wanted out. “[He’s] a disrespectful antisemite,” offered his manager/wife, Sharon. “He fucked with the wrong Jew this time … the motherfucker’s a pig.”
So, as per usual, the actual music is hard to hear over the accompanying clamour, but if you strain your ears you can make out an album that’s an improvement on 2021’s Donda. It’s still uneven in a way that occasionally makes you wonder what on earth Volumes 2 and 3 of Vultures are going to sound like: what price their contents if his big comeback finds room for stuff like the limp title track and Hoodrat, based on an initially pleasingly chaotic and relentless sample that’s allowed to ramble on well past the threshold of endurance? There are hopelessly weak verses from West – if you like feeble sex rhymes laden with unfunny puns, Vultures is very much the album for you – and the standard of his lyrics is thrown into stark relief by a exceptionally snappy guest verse from Indiana MC Freddie Gibbs on Back to Me: “Just turned a bird bitch to my ex like I was Elon,” he raps, with a distinct hint of “this is how it’s done”.

But there are more in the way of good ideas here than on its bloated and unfocused predecessor, beginning with the presence of Ty Dolla $ign, who’s both a far better vocalist than West – Glastonbury-goers may recall West’s nerve-jangling attempt to sing Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody sans Auto-Tune – and a unifying presence on an album that leaps wildly around stylistically, from the distorted abstractions of Paperwork to the melodically rich and hook-laden Burn, a throwback to the style that made West famous in the first place.
The presence of a track that could theoretically slot into West’s debut album underlines a feeling that flickers intermittently throughout Vultures. Its musical highlights are frequently powered by the sense that what Kanye West currently wants more than anything is a big, undeniable hit of the kind he used to make with startling regularity: perhaps to counter the prevalent narrative that his talent has waned as his notoriety has exploded in hitherto unimaginable ways, and perhaps out of the cynical but not-unfounded belief that few things cause the music industry to wipe the slate clean and let bygones be bygones quite like vast commercial success. You can hear it in Burn, the infernally catchy, Juvenile-sampling Do It and in Problematic on which Ty Dolla $ign’s vocal – lightly dusted with Auto-Tune rather than submerged in it – genuinely soars. And you can hear it in Carnival, which opens with a hook that’s evidently designed for huge crowds to bellow along to and proceeds in thrillingly epic style, assisted by a huge choral sample, and a snatch of the beat from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’s Hell of a Life, another throwback to an era when West’s genius far outshone his ability to provoke outrage.
Then again, there are moments during Vultures when you wonder whether West actually wants anyone to forget the attendant controversy. The kindest interpretation of his recent actions is that he’s a desperately unwell man who’s been manipulated by some of the worst people imaginable, white supremacist Nick Fuertes among them. Another interpretation is that he’s a kind of nuclear-powered edgelord, looking to provoke a reaction, which he certainly did, one that went far beyond online outrage and led to a spike in antisemitic attacks, among them synagogues and Jewish cemeteries vandalised with the phrase “Kanye was right”.
And if you cleave to the edgelord theory, there’s plenty of evidence to support it here. The cover design may have been changed so it no longer evokes the work of reprehensible black metal band Burzum, but there’s a lot of dialling back on West’s recent apology to the Jewish community, by way of awful jokes and boasts: he can’t be antisemitic because he “just fucked a Jewish bitch” offers the title track; jokingly comparing himself to the disgraced R Kelly and Bill Cosby on Carnival; rapping “antisemite / still the king” on King. It isn’t shocking so much as profoundly depressing: the actions of a man who thinks he can get away with it because he’s made an album so unequivocally brilliant, it negates all other criticism. For all Vultures’ scattered musical high points, he’s wrong on both counts.",2024-02-12T11:50:56Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
Kanye West erscheint mit skurriler Maske beim Super Bowl,"Geht er damit zu weit? Kanye West (46) ist inzwischen berühmt-berüchtigt für seinen ausgefallenen Style. Dieser trifft dabei auch nicht immer den Geschmack seiner Mitmenschen. Auch deswegen hatte der Musiker zuletzt immer wieder ordentlich Kritik einstecken müssen. So wie auch jetzt: Denn ein Accessoire seines Outfits, das er beim Sportevent des Jahres trug, wirft nun so einige Fragen auf. Kanye erschien mit auffälliger Maskierung beim Super Bowl.
Als der US-Rapper gemeinsam mit seiner Frau Bianca Censori bei der Veranstaltung erschien, zog er mal wieder alle Blicke auf sich. Das zeigten Bilder, die Page Six vorliegen. Auf diesen versteckte Kanye sein Gesicht hinter einer ausgefallenen Kruzifix-Maske des verstorbenen Designers Alexander McQueen (✝40). Dessen Todestag jährte sich am vergangenen Sonntag zum 14. Mal – deswegen ist anzunehmen, dass der 46-Jährige das auffällige Accessoire wohl zu Ehren der Modelegende trug. Ob das jedoch wirklich die Motivation hinter dem Look war, ist ungewiss – für Gesprächsstoff sorgt er damit allemal.
Nicht nur der Musiker sorgt mit seinen Looks regelmäßig für Entsetzen – auch seine Frau Bianca scheint Gefallen an der Aufmerksamkeit gefunden zu haben. Erst vor wenigen Tagen hatte Daily Mail einige Schnappschüsse des Paares in Los Angeles veröffentlicht. Auf diesen hatte die 29-Jährige lediglich einen durchsichtigen Regenponcho über ihrem sonst komplett nackten Körper getragen.

La succession de Donna Summer accuse Kanye West d'avoir utilisé sa musique sans autorisation,"La succession de Donna Summer voit rouge. Selon eux, le rappeur de ""Stronger"" aurait utilisé une interpolation non autorisée du tube ""I Feel Love"", sorti en 1977, sur ""Good (Don't Die)"", qui figure sur son nouvel album commun avec Ty Dolla $ign, ""Vultures 1"".
La chanson reprend les paroles ""Oh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive"", qui figuraient sur la mélodie du titre de la reine du disco, laquelle est décédée en 2012 à l'âge de 63 ans.
Une déclaration partagée sur la story Instagram du compte de Donna se lit comme suit : ""Kanye West... a demandé la permission d'utiliser la chanson I Feel Love de Donna Summer, cela lui a été refusé... il a changé les paroles, a demandé à quelqu'un de la rechanter ou a utilisé AI mais c'est I Feel Love... violation du droit d'auteur ! !!"".
Cette déclaration survient après que Ozzy Osbourne a déjà accusé le rappeur d'avoir samplé 'War Pigs' de Black Sabbath sans autorisation.
Ozzy a fulminé sur X : "".Kanye West a demandé à utilisé un passage de 'War Pig' mais on a refusé car c'est un antisémite qui a brisé le coeur de beaucoup de gens. Il a tout de même utilisé ce passage lors de la soirée de lancement de son album hier soir. Je ne veux pas être associé à cet homme.""",2024-02-12T11:30:00Z,https://www.lfm.ch,lfm.ch
Kanye West Posts Strange Video of Wife Bianca Censori in Revealing Outfit Among Clone-Like Figures,"In a recent Instagram Story, Kanye West shared a peculiar video featuring his wife, Bianca Censori, clad in a revealing ensemble and encircled by clones. The 46-year-old rapper, known for his avant-garde style, unveiled this latest Yeezy promotion recently. Censori, who tied the knot with West in 2023, appeared in a striking brown sheer bodysuit that left little to the imagination, opting to go braless beneath the garment, which extended gracefully to her ankles. Completing the ensemble with towering white fur boots, she strode confidently into the spotlight of a darkened photo studio.

She covered her eyes with her palm as she raised it, highlighting her hourglass form even more. The video was left without any additional background or audio. Over the past month, West has shared numerous photos of his wife wearing his Yeezy creations on social media. After West was charged with demeaning his wife, he made this most recent post. Supporters have already asserted that he may be harming his kids and they feel that the rapper is ""abusing"" Censori. North,10, Saint,8, Chicago,6, and Psalm,4, are the four children that Kim Kardashian, 43, and West have together. Fans are particularly concerned about the effect on children, as he frequently appears in West's photos wearing barely-there, BDSM-style attire. ""I feel terribly for his children and any other child in the family. They will experience the traumatic effects of this psychopath."" On a Kardashian-focused Reddit board, someone posted. ""Kanye - if you don’t want your daughter exploited in this manner when she grows up - maybe you shouldn’t exploit your wife in such a manner. Kids grow up to do as you do,"" another person said, as per The Sun.

When the couple got back together for dinner earlier this week, Kim Kardashian, the ex-wife of West, was slammed for copying Censori's wardrobe, as per Page Six. Recently, pictures of West, Kardashian, and other family members were taken outside a Luxe restaurant in Malibu, California. The family dined at Nobu Malibu in Los Angeles and fans found the interaction ""awkward."" Kardashian was wearing a black tube top with a buckle closing. She accessorized the ensemble with a coat and black fuzzy trousers. Admirers pointed out that she looked similar to anything Censorhadas had worn in the past. A few weeks back, West made headlines as well, when he was seen snatching a phone from a TMZ photographer in response to a question about whether or not his Censori had free will. This follows the endless stream of reports claiming that she has been under Kanye's control.

Fans shared their opinions on a Reddit forum. ""It’s like she wants to recall his BDSM desires by wearing weird stuff like Bianca but won’t fully commit, because it isn’t her,"" observed a fan. Another wrote, ""Bianca inspired much?"" A third said, ""Her trying to impress Kanye.""

Ozzy Osbourne och Donna Summer rasar på Kanye West,"I helgen släppte till sist rapparna Kanye West och Ty Dolla Sign albumet ”Vultures part 1” – efter att skjutit upp det flera gånger.
Bland de frivilliga gästerna på albumet finns Travis Scott, Quavo och Kanyes dotter North West. Men albumet bjöd även på flera ofrivilliga samarbeten.
Bland annat Donna Summers dödsbo – som nekade Kanye West rätten att sampla ur discoklassikern ”I feel love”. När albumet kom ut så var låtdelen i alla fall med. Nu anklagar Donna Summers dödsbo Kanye West för upphovsrättsintrång.
Fick avslag – igen
Även Ozzy Osbourne röt ifrån på sociala medier. Enligt rockikonen bad Kanye West om att få sampla Black Sabbaths låt ”Iron man”, men fick avslag. Det ska Kanye West ha struntat i och använd låtdelen på en releasefest varpå Ozzy Osbourne markerade:
”Jag vill inte ha något samröre med den här mannen”, skriver Ozzy Osbourne och poängterar att orsaken till att han sa nej var att han anser Kanye West vara ”en antisemit som orsakat enorm hjärtesorg för många”.
När albumet väl släpptes var Black Sabbath-samplingen borta.
Kanye West har flera gånger anklagats för att vara antisemit. Det hela kulminerade hösten 2022 då han gästade högernationalisten Alex Jones podcast och hyllade Hitler. Detta fick skivbolaget Def Jam och klädmärken att bryta med Kanye West – som därefter bett om ursäkt.",2024-02-12T10:01:32Z,https://www.svt.se,Sveriges Television

Wearing her signature sunglasses, H.E.R. wowed the audience during Usher's 13-minute set by playing a blistering guitar solo. More than a few people who didn't immediately recognize the Grammy winner mistook her for Kardashian's 10-year-old daughter.

Kanye West featuring la Curva Nord Milano: i cori dell'Inter nell'ultimo album del rapper,"Kanye West featuring la Curva Nord Milano: i cori dell'Inter nell'ultimo album del rapper

Continua il coinvolgimento del noto rapper americano Kanye West nel calcio italiano. L'ultima idea del musicista lo ha portato a campionare alcuni cori della Curva Nord Milano, cuore del tifo dell'Inter, per farne una base, o forse più di una, da utilizzare nel suo prossimo album. Lo scorso weekend infatti è stato pubblicato l'ultimo lavoro del rapper statunitense, che dal 2021 ha cambiato legalmente il suo nome in Ye, un album dal titolo ""Vultures 1"" realizzato in collaborazione con Ty Dolla Sign. Tra le 16 tracce ve ne sono due, ""Stars"" e ""Carnival"", che tra i credits ufficiali riportano anche il settore più caldo dei tifosi dell'Inter.
Come detto, non si stratta dell'unica iniziativa legata al calcio italiano da parte del musicista (e politico, nel 2020 ha persino corso per le presidenziali negli Stati Uniti d'America, ndr) nativo di Atalanta, Georgia: Kanye West infatti era stato ospite dello stadio Marassi solo pochi mesi fa, ad inizio ottobre, per Genoa-Milan, match vinto dai rossoneri per 1-0 con un finale a dir poco rovente.
Vista la sua grande passione per il calcio nostrano, il rapper statunitense ha approfittato dell'occasione per assistere da spettatore alla sfida, al fianco del presidente genoano Alberto Zangrillo.",2024-02-12T07:04:00Z,https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com,TUTTO mercato WEB

On Sunday, Kanye, 46, and his wife, Bianca Censori, 29, watched the San Fransisco 49ers take on the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2024 Super Bowl.
In a new video shared on his Instagram, the Flashing Lights hitmaker gave fans a glimpse at his outfit of the evening.
He wore his familiar tight hosiery mask that covered his entire face along with another black mask over it with a silhouette of Jesus in the middle.
The rap music star also wore a leather jacket zipped up to his neck.
He captioned his post, ""Alexander McQueen Jesus Mask.""
His ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, 43, along with her sister, Khloe, 38, was also in attendance at the Las Vegas arena.
Before the big game, the two Kardashian sisters were spotted entering Allegiant Stadium.
This isn't the first time the star's had an awkward run-in.
A FAMILY OUTING
Last month, the exes were spotted at Nobu Malibu in Los Angeles, California.
Kim brought their daughter, North, along with a gaggle of her friends along for the meal.

North, as well as cousin Penelope Disick, 11, and their crew were all decked out in matching black, long-sleeve shirts with a Vultures logo pattern, in support of Kanye's upcoming new album.
Ye's release with collaborator Ty Dollar $ign has been pushed back more than once and was finally been released on February 9 - and many fans were left disappointed.
'DISAPPOINTED'
In an online forum, critics shared their frustrations with the rapper's lackluster first volume.
""Kinda disappointed. Maybe I'm getting too old, but I didn't enjoy this album very much,"" one critic said.
""Definitely not perfect mixing. I think King is a bit low,"" another critic noted.
""The mix is actually a letdown. It feels half-done. A lot of other tunes still need work,"" a third critic mentioned.
""Songs are unstructured all over the place. It's good, but not quite great,"" a fourth person wrote.
""Listened. Mixing is ehh. Donda had a better record. It was meaningful. This is just some wack lyrics,"" a commentator chimed.
'WANT NO ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN'
The criticism continued when rock legend Ozzy Osbourne, 75, accused Kanye of sampling one of his songs without permission.
This past Friday, the rock star legend tweeted an all-caps rant on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
""[Kanye West] ASKED PERMISSION TO SAMPLE A SECTION OF A 1983 LIVE PERFORMANCE OF 'WAR PIG' FROM THE US FESTIVAL WITHOUT VOCALS & WAS REFUSED PERMISSION BECAUSE HE IS AN ANTISEMITE AND HAS CAUSED UNTOLD HEARTACHE TO MANY,"" he wrote.
""HE WENT AHEAD AND USED THE SAMPLE ANYWAY AT HIS ALBUM LISTENING PARTY LAST NIGHT.""
""I WANT NO ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN!"" Ozzy closed.
Ye clapped back on his Instagram Story and shared a photo of Ozzy and his wife, Sharon Osbourne, 71, dressed up as himself and Bianca for Halloween.

God save McQueen.
Kanye West hid his face with a head-turning crucifix mask at the Super Bowl 2024 on Sunday, which he attended with wife Bianca Censori.
The accessory — a vintage Alexander McQueen piece hailing from the designer’s fall 1996 “Dante” collection — featured a three-dimensional white crucifix between the eyes.
Seeing as Sunday marked the 14th anniversary of McQueen’s death, West likely wore the mask to honor the late fashion legend.
The controversial musician layered the religious mask atop a second, stretchier headpiece, and bundled up for the big game in a black leather jacket.
Censori matched her husband’s vibe with a black latex head covering — albeit one that actually showed her face — along with a leather coat.

The “Heartless” artist, 46, and his Yeezy employee, 29, have not been shy in showing off their risqué looks since tying the knot in December 2022, and have recently sported see-through raincoats, hosiery-centric outfits and dozens of different face masks.
It’s unclear exactly when West and Censori touched down in Sin City, but they were in the midst of many fellow celebrities –– including the rapper’s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.
Kardashian, 43, was photographed arriving at the big game in a motocross-style Balenciaga look.

The rapper has sampled her 1977 hit I Feel Love on the track Good (Don’t Die) on his new album Vultures 1.

But the estate of the late singer, who passed away in 2012, have slammed him for its inclusion, saying they explicitly rejected his request to use the track.
Despite being heavily sampled, a different voice sings her lines in Kanye’s song.
A post on the Instagram page for Donna’s estate said: “Kanye West...asked permission to use Donna Summer’s song I Feel Love.
“He was denied...he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it’s I Feel Love...copyright infringement!!!”
It comes days after Ozzy Osbourne also hit out at Kanye for the same reason.
On Friday, he wrote on Instagram: “Kanye West asked permission to sample a section of a 1983 live performance of Iron Man from the US festival without vocals and was refused permission because he is an anti-Semite and has caused untold heartachhowelle to many.
“He went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night. I want no association with this man!”
The album’s release was delayed in December when Nicki Minaj refused to give permission to include a verse she had rapped on the album.
Meanwhile, the 16-song record had also been due to include a track sampling Backstreet Boys’ Everybody (Backstreet’s Back) although that did not materialise, with many suggesting they were not happy with its use.

Feb. 11 (UPI) -- Ozzy Osbourne threatened to sue Kanye West for sampling Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" after the embattled rapper put the heavy metal classic on his newly released album, ""Vultures, Volume 1,"" without permission. In a post to the platform X on Friday, Osbourne said West reached out to ask if he could sample a portion of the 1983 live performance of ""Iron Man,"" but he ""was refused permission because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many,"" Osbourne wrote in all caps.

West allegedly ""went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night,"" Osbourne claims, adding ""I want no association with this man!""
Osbourne referenced an impromptu performance Thursday night at Chicago's United Center, where West and co-producer Ty Dolla $ign performed tracks from the new album, including the song ""Carnival,"" which contains the riff from Black Sabbath.
Ozzy's wife and representative, Sharon Osbourne, issued a statement saying, ""We are considering legal action. Our team have spoken with theirs.""
Amid the uproar, West's camp reportedly put out an audio clip of Osbourne from an infamous 1982 interview in which the rocker said he admired the charisma of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler before allegedly biting off the head of a bat.

"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign ""Do It"" With YG & Nipsey Hussle On ""Vultures"" Cut: Stream","Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign have finally dropped their collaborative album Vultures, the first in what's supposed to be a series of album drops. Two more collab volumes are supposedly on the way, plus a Ye solo album called Y3; that last one is according to EPMD legend Erick Sermon. While we'll never believe a Kanye album rollout until we actually get a release, it's at least nice to see folks fully react to these new tracks. Moreover, one of the most fun and simple bops on the whole project is ""Do It,"" which features guest vocals from Nipsey Hussle and YG. Nip's appearance is actually a sample from the late legend's leaked song ""I Just Wanna Know"" song with Cardi B and Ty himself.
That section opens up the track, which then goes into a party banger with a West Coast bounce, soaring string-like embellishments, and haunting background vocals. Ty Dolla Sign delivers a killer hook melody and previews the song's hedonistic and lustful themes. To no one's surprise, Kanye West indulges in this theme with no hesitation, including some cheeky lines about Apple Pay. YG does his thing towards the end with a nonchalant demeanor over a beat that sounds perfectly suited to his style. Along with the likes of ""Fuk Sumn,"" this record encompasses what makes Vultures a fun listen, albeit one that is pretty one-note.

Last week, Kanye posted an image to his Instagram story of himself and Censori showing off their respective phone backgrounds. West's was a picture of Censori wearing a leather bikini. Meanwhile, Censori's was a picture of someone dressed as Jason Vorhees. While Censori appears to be topless on the cover of Vultures 1, it is now relatively evident that the innocuous photo was a backdoor teaser for the cover art.

Vultures 1: Kanye West quer revidar as pancadas recebidas,"Vultures 1 Onde Disponível nas plataformas digitais
Disponível nas plataformas digitais Gravadora YZY
YZY Artista Kanye West (Y$)
Emplacar um disco novo quando a fase está boa é fácil. No atual momento do americano Kanye West, é difícil até prever se o público vai querer parar para ouvir ""Vultures 1"", que ele gravou com ajuda de seu colaborador mais frequente nos últimos tempos, o rapper Ty Dolla $ign, no duo que batizaram como Y$.
Não adianta muito dizer que o novo trabalho, lançado na madrugada do último sábado, tem algumas doses bem encaixadas de trap e alguns momentos inesperados de R&B mais comportado, e até um pouco de ambientação sonora que lembra discos de música gospel. Nem alertar que as letras continuam agressivas, numa obra poética que parece querer ser mais corrosiva a cada lançamento.
O rapper Kanye West - Patrick Kovarik/AFP
Certamente as pessoas querem saber mesmo se ele continua atacando os judeus nos versos, porque ""Vultures 1"", preparado como álbum inicial de uma trilogia, é o primeiro que ele apresenta após suas declarações antissemitas que o fizeram perder patrocínios, contratos para shows, campanhas publicitárias e ""zilhões"" de seguidores nas redes sociais.
Para quem entende de indústria de entretenimento, a opinião unânime é que não existe pecado maior no showbiz americano do que comportamento antissemita. Kanye West, ou Ye, que é o nome que adota atualmente –já teve vários!–, não suspende o fogo em ""Vultures"". Não apenas contra judeus, citados em alguns poucos versos. Ele dispara em todos os ""abutres"", ou ""vultures"", em inglês, que não gostem dele.
Bem, detratores não faltam, mas ainda surpreende que ele, mesmo perdendo um mundo de dinheiro e o apoio de uma grande gravadora, ainda não tenha sucumbido a um cancelamento artístico. Provavelmente, é a magnitude de sua carreira que segura as pontas.
A dezena de álbuns que Kanye West lançou antes de ""Vultures 1"" forma uma obra poderosa, para muitos a mais relevante do hip-hop americano. Seu disco de 2010, ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"", ainda é o grande álbum do hip-hop e aquele com a maior coleção de referências diferentes que alguém já gravou.
Em ""Yeezus"", de 2013, ele foi ousado quando o gênero estava numa calmaria modorrenta, para depois defender um rap retrô, ""sem tanto lixo misturado"", quando lançou ""Donda"", de três anos atrás.
""Vultures 1"" peca por algumas letras bobas, que se perdem na verborragia de um poeta querendo revidar as pancadas que recebeu de todos os lados. Mas é um trabalho consistente de rap, que certamente seria endeusado se produzido por um artista iniciante. Em se tratando de Kanye West, talvez fossem necessárias algumas faixas mais acessíveis, mais fadadas ao sucesso.
Duas delas chegam perto. ""Fuk Sumn"", que conta com ótimas participações vocais de Playboi Cardi e Scott Travis, traz as evoluções de batidas incomuns que marcam o melhor de Kanye West desde seu início. Impossível ouvir e ficar parado. Se o artista tem planos de lançar singles para maior divulgação do trabalho, algo que ainda não foi anunciado, esse deveria ser o primeiro da fila.
""Beg Forgiveness"" é outra faixa com vida própria, impressiona mesmo ouvida fora do contexto todo do álbum. Há revolta, claro, mas é a letra na qual Kanye West reflete com mais densidade sobre suas ações mais recentes, tanto nas provocações quanto na reação a seus críticos. Como ela encerra o álbum, pode até dar a impressão que o volume dois de ""Vultures"" vai tomar outros rumos.
""Carnival"" é outra música que merece uma atenção especial. Não há nela nenhuma fagulha de inspiração inédita, nada genial, mas é a mais arrebatadora entre as 16 que estão no álbum. Hip-hop direto, certeiro, uma cartilha para fisgar qualquer público.
No restante, é um bom repertório no qual uma ou outra faixa se destaca por alguma grande sacada na gravação. Como a linha de baixo pesada e distorcida de ""Paperwork"" ou os sintetizadores quase hipnóticos de ""Burn"".
É curioso perceber que as músicas mais sofisticadas no instrumental são justamente as menos cáusticas nas letras agressivas, como se nessas o rapper se preocupasse mais com a virulência dos versos do que com a construção rítmica.
Seria bom se Kanye West pudesse sustentar uma turnê nesse momento tortuoso de sua vida, porque o material de ""Vultures 1"" pode crescer muito no palco.",2024-02-11T20:19:00Z,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br,Folha de S.Paulo
Kanye West takes 'coward' step to avoid Kim Kardashian at Super Bowl,"File Footage
Kanye West was dubbed a 'coward' as he hid his face with a bizarre mask in order to avoid his ex-wife Kim Kardashian at the 2024 Super Bowl.
In conversation with The Mirror, body language expert Judi James claimed that the rapper and his wife Bianca Censori appeared 'anxious' with the fear of bumping into the Skims founder.
While analysing the Australian beauty's expressions, the expert said, ""Bianca's wide-eyed beauty and her expression do seem to signal wariness or tension here.""
Speaking of Kanye, Judi said, ""In his Dath Vader-chic, with his crucifix face mask in place to hide any trace of emotions like wariness or anxiety at the prospect of bumping into either his ex Kim, her current man Odell, or even the Queen of the Super Bowl and the woman he has dissed in the past, Taylor Swift.""
She further added that the musician committed a mistake by making his partner's 'tense' facial expressions visible to the world.
""When a man takes his current wife to a gathering that includes his ex wife and her new love interest and then proceeds to render himself invisible, making his current wife's facial expressions visible to the world it might not look like the bravest move in the book,"" Judi said.
For the unversed, Kanye was married to Kim for ten years. However, the two parted ways in 2021.
Notably, the former couple co-parents their four kids, North, 10, Saint, 7, Chicago, 5, and Psalm, 4.",2024-02-11T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Kanye West announces mystery show after ‘Vultures’ chart-topping release,"‘Vultures’ track ‘Carnival’ recently reached number 1 on a ‘Top Songs’ chart
Kanye West is celebrating the success of his new album.
Following the release of Vultures 1 – the debut album of his new supergroup with Ty Dolla Sign called ¥$ – Ye announced a surprise performance to showcase his latest musical venture.
The legendary rapper, 46, took to Instagram to tease fans about a mystery event near the Wynn hotel by sharing a cryptic black place card with the number one, symbolising the launch of Vultures Volume One.
Alongside the mysterious post, Kanye wrote, “VULTURES YE & FRIENDS 3120 S. LAS VEGAS BLVD LAS VEGAS 02 11 24 ¥$.”
But the Runaway hitmaker had one more piece of good news to share.
In another post, he further flaunted his triumphs, celebrating the apparent success of the track Carnival from his new collaborative album as the snapshot showed it proudly occupying the top spot on an unknown “Top Songs” chart.
With characteristic Kanye flair, he captioned the celebratory post with, “MOM WE DID IT WE NUMBER 1 AGAIN YEEZY.COM.”
The shout-out was another testament to his deep connection with his late mother, Donda West.
Vultures Volume One is just the beginning, marking the inaugural chapter in Kanye's planned trilogy.",2024-02-11T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
Kanye West attends Super Bowl in presence of Taylor Swift,"File Footage
Kanye West entered what could be considered hostile territory when he attended the Super Bowl on Sunday, where both his rival Taylor Swift and ex-wife Kim Kardashian were present.
The 46-year-old rapper went incognito as he made his way to the event, accompanied by his wife Bianca Censori.
Kanye's marriage to Kim officially ended in 2021, and she has since begun dating Odell Beckham Jr.
The rapper was also previously engulfed in drama with Taylor after she took offense at a lyric in his track Famous back in 2016, sparking an epic feud.
The accompanying music video for Famous also depicted a nak** Taylor lying in his bed next to him - along with a whole host of other celebrities - with nude Kim on the other side.
In Famous, Kanye rapped: 'For all my South Side n****s that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have s**/ Why? I made that b***h famous.'
Kanye defended the line, claiming he had a conversation with Taylor about the lyrics in question ahead of time, which she denied.
However, Swift continued to accuse Kanye of lying about asking her permission to reference her in his lyrics which prompted now ex-wife Kim to release a partial recording of the call in question.
Taylor hit back by claiming that although Kanye spoke through some aspects of the lyrics, she did not consent to being referred to as a 'b***h.'
The Bad Blood hitmaker recently opened up about the effect the lyrics had on her as well as the bitter feud between the rapper and SKIMS founder.
While talking to TIME after being named the magazine's Person of the Year in December 2023, she dished on the dispute which started when West wrote the vulgar lyrics about the rising star.
Taylor said that the public fallout said it felt like 'a career death,' adding: 'Make no mistake - my career was taken away from me.'
More recently, West dropped her name again during his Vultures listening experience on Friday.
In his latest song Carnival, Swift's name stands out among a list of controversial figures — including accused rapist Bill Cosby and tech billionaire Elon Musk — who've made it into the lyrics.",2024-02-11T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International
"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign Hosting ""Vultures 1"" Event In Las Vegas: Report","Multiple outlets have reported that there will be a ""Ye & Friends"" event in Las Vegas tonight (February 11). The event comes in the wake of the duo releasing Vultures 1, the first part of their long-awaited collaborative album. Furthermore, it comes a day after the pair performed in Kanye's hometown of Chicago to celebrate the album's release. However, a more wild detail is that the impromptu concert will be taking place during Super Bowl LVIII. The city is already filled with fans who are eagerly awaiting the start of the game between Kansas City and San Francisco. The game will also a feature halftime show headlined by Usher.
Vultures 1 is stacked with talent, featuring nine features. The first feature of Vultures 1 is India Love on ""Keys To My Life"". Two songs later, Kanye is joined by his daughter North West for ""Talking/Once Again"". That is followed by an appearance from Freddie Gibbs on ""Back To Me"". Tracks 7 and 8 are another pair of back-to-back features, with Nipsey Hussle & YG appearing on ""Do It"" and Quavo featuring on ""Paperwork"". The final four features can be found between tracks 10 and 13. There are two appearances by Playboi Carti - ""Fuk Sum"" (also featuring Travis Scott) and ""Carnival"" (also featuring Rich The Kid). Meanwhile, Chris Brown adds his vocals to ""Beg Forgiveness"". Finally, there is the album's namesake, which features Lil Durk & Bump J.

Kanye West Seemingly Confirms Venice Boat Rumors On ""Fuk Sumn""
Meanwhile, Kanye has seemingly confirmed the rumors that he received oral sex from his wife during a public gondola ride in Venice last year. On ""Fuk Sumn"" from his new album Vultures 1, Kanye raps ""Shawty wanna f-ck on somethin'?/F-ck on me/Suck on me, publicly"". This has widely been taken as a reference, and thus confirmation, of what (or who) was going down during that now-infamous boat outing in Italy.
It was never confirmed what was happening with the partially nude Kanye and crouching Bianca Censori. However, the incident led the gondola company to ban the couple. Additionally, there were calls for them to be expelled from Italy for the act of public indecency. Of course, the boat ride came amidst the couple's continually controversial Italian vacation. They faced massive public backlash for Censori's outfits throughout their trip. Meanwhile, Kanye's face coverings sparked debates as to whether he was violating anti-terror laws.

"Έκανε στίχους την ""άσεμνη πράξη"" στη Βενετία","Ο Kanye West δεν πήρε θέση για τον δια βίου αποκλεισμό του ίδιου και της συζύγου του από τις γόνδολες στη Βενετία μετά την “άσεμνη πράξη” στην οποία επιδόθηκαν ,και το κάνει τώρα μέσα από τους στίχους του νέου τραγουδιού του.
Αν νομίζαμε ότι ο Κάνιε Γουέστ (Kanye West) θα άφηνε ασχολίαστα όσα έγιναν το περασμένο καλοκαίρι στη Βενετία, κατά τη διάρκεια μίας βόλτας με σκάφος με τη σύζυγό του Bianca Censori, τότε μάλλον είμαστε γελασμένοι.
Ο γνωστός ράπερ κυκλοφόρησε μόλις το νέο του άλμπουμ, “Vultures 1” και μέσα σε αυτό υπάρχει το τραγούδι με τίτλο “F@@k Sumn”, οι στίχοι του οποίου αναφέρονται μεταξύ άλλων και στο περιστατικό που έλαβε χώρα κατά τη διάρκεια της βαρκάδας του με τη σύζυγό του, για το οποίο μάλιστα τιμωρήθηκαν με ποινή αποκλεισμού δια βίου από την εταιρεία στην οποία ανήκε η γόνδολα.
“Shawty wanna f@@k on somethin’? / F@@k on me / Suck on me, publicly“, τραγουδάει ο βραβευμένος με Grammy τραγουδιστής με τους στίχους να φαίνεται πως παραπέμπουν στο ταξίδι του ζευγαριού στην Ιταλία.
Ο Κάνιε Γουέστ και η Μπιάνκα Σενσόρι “συνελήφθησαν” από τους φωτογραφικούς φακούς τον περασμένο Αύγουστο να προβαίνουν “σε άσεμνη πράξη”, με τις εικόνες και τα βίντεο να κάνουν τον γύρο του διαδικτύου και να δείχνουν τον ράπερ όρθιο και με κατεβασμένο το παντελόνι του και την 28χρονη Αυστραλή να είναι γονατισμένη μπροστά του.
Μετά τη δημοσίευση του ντοκουμέντου (της άσεμνης πράξης), η εταιρεία στην οποία ανήκε η γόνδολα στην οποία επέβαινε το ζευγάρι, εξέδωσε ανακοίνωση Τύπου για να ενημερώσει τον πλανήτη πως απαγορεύει επ’ αόριστον σε αυτούς τους δυο ανθρώπους να χρησιμοποιήσουν τις υπηρεσίες τους.
Πρόσθεσε και ότι εάν το περιστατικό της δημόσιας έκθεσης είχε υποπέσει στην αντίληψη του οδηγού της γόνδολας, θα είχε εκδιώξει αμέσως το ζευγάρι και θα είχε ενημερώσει τις αρχές.
“(Ο οδηγός) Έπρεπε όμως, να προσέχει την κυκλοφορία και έτσι δεν είδε αυτές τις αισχρότητες. Ένα τρίτο άτομο που ήταν στο ταξί, μαζί με τον Ye και την Σενσόρι, εμπόδιζε τη θέα του οδηγού προς το πίσω μέρος του σκάφους”.",2024-02-11T17:21:59Z,https://www.news247.gr,NEWS 24/7
"Ty Dolla Sign Enjoys ""Vultures 1"" Success, Reaches Massive Streaming Accolade","Everyone's talking about the new album Vultures in regards to its most popular artist, Kanye West. Even though a lot of the project sounds like it came from him and is oriented around his status, it's a collab album. A big issue with our coverage of this LP -– and that of most publications, for that matter -– is that we might not have properly taken the time to give Ty Dolla $ign his flowers. Say what you will about his association with Ye's antisemitism, but he is the glue that holds Vultures together, and is its most consistently great force. Fortunately, based on the numbers, the 41-year-old is definitely getting his due praise.
Moreover, a new report emerged suggesting that Ty Dolla Sign is now the ninth most streamed artist on Spotify. Apparently, this reflects a jump of 155 spots from before Vultures had released on the platform after a long wait, which is an amazing feat. Given the discrepancy between his popularity and that of Kanye West, we're glad that this opportunity at least put him on the spotlight in a way that would boost his visibility, his numbers, and his acclaim. No matter what on God's green Earth is going on during any given album cut, you can bet on the Los Angeles native to deliver a strong chorus or melodic line.

Ty Dolla Sign Goes Up With The Release Of Vultures
What's more is that his emotion and perspective also shines through in a very engaging and compelling way. For example, Ty Dolla Sign's half on the track ""Talking,"" plus the music video, shows his dedication and passion as a father. Contrasted with the wild statements that Kanye West espouses, this gets to the heart of their collaborative project in a much more clear and unencumbered way. As such, he's definitely a saving grace on Vultures for those looking for something deeper, although we have to give the production its due credit, too.
If you're interested in who else made this album what it is, you can find the features and production credits here. Do you think that the rap-R&B artist is worty of this praise and success?

Kanye West & Drake Fans Debate North & Adonis' Performances On Their LPs,"Kanye West and Drake may not have the closest or most amicable relationship these days, but they do have one unique thing in common. Both superstars included a track on their most recent LPs (Vultures and For All The Dogs, specifically) on which their children have a chance to spit some bars. North West takes the mic on ""Talking,"" whereas Adonis Graham has a throwback verse over some boom-bap, Cypress Hill-esque beats on ""Daylight."" In fact, North recently made her Global Spotify Charts debut with this new track, and we all know how successful FATD was. Now the question is, which protégé did it better?
That's what a lot of fans jokingly debated online, especially after news of North West's commercial success hit. ""adonis gonna run a diss track,"" one fan commented under the post below, with another adding, ""Kanye’s Daughter > Drakes Son."" However, folks also pointed out that Kanye West and Drake are not the first ones to do this. ""Travis featured Stormi now errbody wanna ft their own kid…."" one user pointed out. Both child performances are pretty different, though, so maybe ""Talking"" and ""Daylight"" can't even be compared in this regard.

Of course, this is all just adding to the monstrous hype and discussion around Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's finally released collab album, Vultures. Ye claims that it's number one in 72 countries including Israel, and we'll see next week how this chart performance translates into sales and acclaim. This is obviously a very difficult beast to tackle given the Chicago artist's rampant antisemitism, but most folks already separated that from this rollout. Even though he made it pretty impossible, they are still (disappointingly) mutually exclusive things in folks' minds.
Meanwhile, the 6ix God is busy on his Big As The What? tour with J. Cole right now, having a lot of fun with the Dreamville MC. He probably won't drop something new for a while, so maybe we won't get an Adonis verse for quite some time. But maybe this is when he and North West kick off their solo careers.

A música em questão é ""Good (Don't Die)"", do novo álbum conjunto lançado por West com Ty Dolla $ign, ""Vultures 1"". A faixa começa com a letra ""Ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive"", que parece estar na melodia de ""I Feel Love"" de Summer.

Taylor Swift está de volta à boca de Kanye West. O rapper, que lançou neste sábado (10) seu novo álbum ""Vultures 1"", em pareceria com Ty Dolla $ign, menciona o nome da cantora em uma das faixas, ""Carnival"".
""I made six Taylor Swift/Since I had the Rollie on the wrist/I’m the new Jesus, bitch, I turn water to Crist"", diz o trecho da música (""Eu 'fiz' seis Taylor Swift/Desde que botei o Rollie [Rolex] no pulso/Eu sou o novo Jesus, vadia, eu transformo água em Jesus"", em tradução livre).

No TikTok, fãs tentam explicar a que West estaria se referindo com ""fazer"". Há especulações de que o trecho insinue que ele dormiu com seis estrelas pop como Swift, ou de que a fala seria uma alusão aos U$S 6,6 bilhões que ele teria acordado ganhar em sua parceria recente com a Adidas. Também se diz que esta seria uma menção ao início do problema entre os dois artistas.
A relação conturbada entre West e Swift começou em 2009, quando ele invadiu o discurso da cantora na cerimônia do Video Music Awards e arrancou o microfone de sua mão. Na ocasião, Swift recebia o prêmio por seu clipe ""You Belong With Me"". West declarou que Beyoncé deveria levar o prêmio, porque ""tinha um dos melhores clipes de todos os tempos"".
Em 2016, o rapper lançou a música ""Famous"", em que dizia: ""I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/Why? I made that bitch famous"" (""Acho que talvez eu e Taylor possamos transar/Por quê? Eu deixei aquela vadia famosa"", em tradução livre).
À época, ele afirmou que Swift teria consentido com a inclusão de seu nome na faixa. Uma gravação de uma conversa telefônica entre os dois, vazada pela então mulher de West, Kim Kardashian, dava a entender que de fato ela teria aprovado o pedido. No entanto, a conversa completa, divulgada em 2020, mostrava que Swift não deu seu aval.",2024-02-11T15:15:00Z,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br,Folha de S.Paulo
"Kanye West Claims ""Vultures 1"" Is No. 1 In 72 Countries, Including Israel","Folks are still bumping Vultures by Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign everywhere, and it looks like that's translating into commercial success. Moreover, the former has reposted a report on social media that the album is number one in 72 countries, including Israel. He posted it on his Instagram Story this weekend, and a clip also emerged online of him speaking to a crowd and making the same claim. It's unclear what are the exact metrics this report is based on, but there's a lot of ways in which it could manifest: iTunes charts, streaming, or a combination of both. Still, chart data suggested that the project was removed from Apple Music and iTunes charts when it went down temporarily, so how these numbers will manifest is still unclear.
Furthermore, this is a particularly interesting claim because this list of countries apparently includes Israel. Of course, Kanye West wants to highlight this because of his rampant antisemitism references on Vultures, and his bigoted actions and statements off wax. Yet it's probably more of a reflection of his massive reach and scope of visibility as an artist rather than folks agreeing with these stances. As such, we still need a little more time to determine what the general public consensus is when it comes to this album.

In addition to all that, there are also other elements of Vultures that were still rocky before it finally dropped. One of these is, obviously, sample clearance issues, as Ozzy Osbourne took to Twitter recently to blast Kanye West for trying to use a song of his without clearing it properly. It didn't end up on the final version of the album, so we know that the untouched version of the project will probably never come out. But this is part of pretty much every Ye rollot at this point, so it hardly comes as a surprise.

Kanye West name-drops Taylor Swift in brand new album,"The bad blood between West and Swift continues.
Kanye West reportedly named-dropped Taylor Swift in his brand new track “Carnival,” which was released as part of his highly-anticipated album “Vultures 1.”
“Why she say she sucked my d–k? / Then she say she ain’t sucked my d–k/ She gon’ take it up the a– / Like a ventriloquist / I made six Taylor Swift / Since I had the Rollie on the wrist,” West, 46, raps.
West, who has a rocky past with Swift, also manages to drop several high-profile celebrity names including R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, Puff Daddy, and Elon Musk.
“Elon, where my rocket ship? / It’s time to go home,” he raps. “They served us the porn (Ha) / Since the day we was born (Ha) / Anybody pissed off (Ha) / Gotta make ’em drink the urine (Ha) / Now I’m Ye-Kelly, b–ch (Ha) / Now, I’m Bill Cosby, b–ch (Ha) / Now, I’m Puff Daddy rich (Ha) / That’s #MeToo me rich (Ha),” West continues.
The Post reached out to Swift for comment.
West’s feud with the “Cruel Summer” singer began in 2009 when the “Donda” singer infamously hopped up on the MTV Video Music Awards stage during Swift’s acceptance speech for Best Female Music Video of the Year and declared that Beyonce “had one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time!”

The duo’s relationship took a volatile turn in 2016 when West name-dropped Swift, 34, in his song “Famous.”
“I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b–ch famous,” sang the rapper.
West asserted that he didn’t mean to diss the “Blank Space” songstress adding that he and Swift “had a hourlong convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.”

Swift later refuted that West didn’t tell her about the “I made that b–tch famous” line.
To make matters worse, West’s then-wife Kim Kardashian, published part of the phone call between the pair discussing the song on her Snapchat account adding fuel to the already blazing inferno.
“When he gets on the phone with me, and I was so touched that he would be respectful and, like, tell me about this one line in the song… And I was like, ‘Okay, good. We’re back on good terms,'” the “You Belong With Me” songstress told Rolling Stone in 2019. “And then when I heard the song, I was like, ‘I’m done with this. If you want to be on bad terms, let’s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.’”

While the purpose of West’s lyrics is unknown, several social media users have taken to the internet with their own responses to the song with many of them claiming that West is using Swift to stay relevant.
“Taylor Swift was his target twice and has successfully moved on from both events and thrived. Meanwhile, Kanye feels the need to name drop her every time he needs clout and attention,” one user on X (formerly Twitter) argued.
“Kanye West still unironically thinking he made Taylor Swift famous is so .. like if you’re the one using her name in songs TWICE because you’re desperate for attention, I don’t think you’re as relevant as you think you are,” a second person slammed.
“Kanye, is the only [person] who’s gonna mention Taylor Swift’s name in an attempt to get relevant again and perhaps a bit famous,” a third person wrote.”Just like when he begged to have her name in his song last time when he illegally recorded her call & his ex-wife edited it to paint TS as a liar.”",2024-02-11T14:44:44Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post

Insofern hat er sich doch noch rangehalten mit seinem neuen, gemeinsam mit dem Kollegen Ty Dolla Sign eingespielten und produzierten und immer wieder verschobenen Album „Vultures I“. West organisierte zwei öffentliche Listening-Shows Ende vergangener Woche, und zack war „Vultures“ dann am Samstag noch rechtzeitig vor dem Superbowl auf den Streamingkanälen platziert - auf dass es Usher, der in der Halbzeitshow auftritt, und wiederum seinem neuen Album „Coming Home“ die Show stehle.
„Crazy, bipolar, antisemite“
Kanye West will demonstrieren, dass er der größte Rapper auf Erden ist, der nach vielen Kabalen in der vergangenen Zeit umstrittenste, verruchteste sowieso. „King“ heißt der Schlusstrack des Albums, und darin fasst West seine Reputation zusammen: „And, I’m still ,Crazy, bipolar, antisemite’/ And I’m still the king/They thought headlines was my kryptonite, bitch/ I’m still the king, I’m still the king.“
Verrückt, bipolar, antisemitisch - wie sehr hier eins das andere mit sich bringt, wie sehr der pathologische Größenwahn des Rappers mit seinem Antisemitismus einher geht, ist schwer auseinanderzuhalten. Fakt ist: West fiel vor einiger Zeit mit antisemitischen Sprüchen einmal mehr unangenehm auf und kündigte in sozialen Medien an, auf „death con 3 on jewish people“ gehen zu wollen. Abbitte hat er zwar geleistet und sich entschuldigt, jetzt seien bei „Vultures“ gar „a few Jews on the staff now“. Und trotzdem: Man glaubt ihm nicht.
Inszenieren tut er sich parallel zu der Albumveröffentlichung als Bösewicht mit Kapuze, und wenn man so will: als Gegenmodell zu Taylor Swift.
Vor dem Hintergrund, dass West große Stücke auf Donald Trump hält, darf man nun dieses Superbowl-Wochenende als Pop-Polit-Showdown vor den US-Präsidentschaftswahlen im November sehen: hier Taylor Swift auf der Tribüne, die ihrem Freund Travis Kelce beim Spielen zuschaut, womöglich US-Präsident Joe Biden trifft und so vielleicht den Demokraten einen Schub verleiht; dort Kanye West, („I made six Taylor Swifts“ singt er auf einem der Stücke von „Vultures“), der das böse Amerika, das Trump-Amerika repräsentiert.",2024-02-11T13:55:49Z,https://www.tagesspiegel.de,Tagesspiegel
Vultures 1 von Kanye West: #MeToo-Reich,"Rapper Kanye West hat ein neues Album. Auf dem vergleicht er sich - unter anderem - mit ein paar der berühmtesten Vergewaltiger der vergangenen Jahre.

Der große Ozzy Osbourne hatte zu dem ganzen Komplex Kanye West jüngst eine sehr eindeutige Meinung. Der Rapper und Produzent West, der derzeit eher unter dem Namen Ye firmierte, hatte bei dem Sänger angefragt, ob er - mal wieder - ein Sample von dessen Band Black Sabbath benutzen dürfe. Eine Live-Aufnahme des Songs ""Iron Man"" diesmal, den Song hatte West schon mal für ""Hell of a Life"" verwendet. Osbournes Antwort auf der Plattform X ist, nun, man würde wohl sagen: hart in der Sache - aber einigermaßen versöhnlich im Ton, deshalb hier weitestgehend im Wortlaut:",2024-02-11T13:52:20Z,https://www.sueddeutsche.de,Süddeutsche Zeitung
Engländerin backt sich lebensgroße Taylor Swift,"Taylor Swift , 34, Sängerin, besteht aus Zucker. Ihre Erschaffung dauerte 38 Stunden, verteilt über eine Woche. 130 Kilogramm Zutaten wurden dafür benötigt. Eine Bäckerin namens Lara Mason, 37, aus dem englischen Brownhills hat sich diese Taylor Swift gebacken, eine zwei Meter hohe Kuchenskulptur. Die Gebackene schmeckt nach Vanille und Red Velvet, trägt einen roten Pulli mit dem Logo der Kansas City Chiefs, dem Team ihres Freundes Travis Kelce, und reckt die Superbowl-Trophäe nach oben. Eigentlich habe sie auch noch einen Travis-Kelce-Kuchen anfertigen wollen, verriet Mason der BBC , aber dann bekam sie es zeitlich nicht mehr gebacken.

Ozzy Osbourne, 75, Musiker, hat Stress mit Kanye West. Der Altrocker wirft dem US-Rapper vor, seine Musik ohne seine Zustimmung verwendet zu haben. Auf Instagram schrieb Osbourne, West habe um Erlaubnis gebeten, einen Teil einer Live-Performance des Black-Sabbath-Klassikers ""Iron Man"" aus dem Jahr 1983 ohne Gesang verwenden zu dürfen. Die Erlaubnis sei West verweigert worden, ""weil er ein Antisemit ist und vielen Menschen unsagbaren Herzschmerz bereitet hat"". Trotzdem habe der US-Musiker davon bei einer Veranstaltung in dieser Woche Gebrauch gemacht. ""Ich will mit diesem Mann nicht in Verbindung gebracht werden!"", wütete Osbourne.

Ben Affleck, 51, Muse, inspiriert seine Frau zu kreativem Output. Ihr Liebes-Comeback sei ""sehr, sehr inspirierend"" für ihre neuen Songs gewesen, sagte US-Sängerin Jennifer Lopez, 54, der Welt am Sonntag, kurz vor Erscheinen ihres neuen Albums. ""Diese Liebesgeschichte zwischen Ben und mir ist ziemlich unglaublich. Und sie hat niemanden mehr überrascht als mich selbst."" Lopez und Affleck hatten im Sommer 2022 überraschend in Las Vegas geheiratet, nachdem sie rund 20 Jahre zuvor schon einmal verlobt gewesen waren. Die ""Bennifer-Romanze"" dauerte damals allerdings nur 18 Monate.

Caroline Peters, 52, Schauspielerin (""Mord mit Aussicht""), träumt von Lummerland. ""Worüber ich durchaus regelmäßig nachdenke, ist, wie es wäre, wenn ich gar nicht mehr arbeiten würde"", sagte Peters der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Sie sei zwar sehr zufrieden mit dem, was sie mache. Aber in stressigen Momenten habe sie ""stundenlange Tagträume"" von einem Leben, in dem man Geld hätte, ohne dafür arbeiten zu müssen. Diese Träume gingen dann ""in Richtung Lummerland"", also der fiktiven Insel mit sehr wenigen Bewohnern, die in den ""Jim Knopf""-Büchern von Michael Ende vorkommt.

Rappt Kanye West in neuem Song über Skandal-Bootstour?,"Kanye West (46) und seine Ehefrau Bianca Censori sorgen fast nur noch für Negativ-Schlagzeilen. Laut einem Experten stellt der Rapper seine Frau öffentlich zur Show und manipuliert sie. Im vergangenen Jahr in Venedig wurde der Künstler sogar mit herunter gelassener Hose auf einer Gondel abgelichtet. Doch nicht nur das war damals merkwürdig: Denn Bianca kniete zudem verdächtig vor ihm. Und offenbar thematisiert Kanye diesen Eklat jetzt in seinem neuen Album.
Kanye macht in seinem neuen Album ""Vultures 1"" anscheinend eine Anspielung auf die unangemessene Bootsfahrt mit seiner Ehefrau Bianca in Italien. In dem Song ""F-k Sumn"" rappt der Grammy-Gewinner darüber, wie er unanständige Dinge mit ihr tun wolle. ""Fick mich, blas mir öffentlich einen"", heißt es nämlich in einer Strophe, wie Page Six berichtet.
Die Fans sorgen sich und finden, dass Kanye Bianca sexualisiert. In einem Interview mit The Sun analysierte die Psychologin Carolyn Mair das fragwürdige Verhalten des Songwriters. Sie kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass er nur auf ihre ""körperliche Erscheinung"" und die ""sexuellen Attribute"" fixiert sei. Außerdem erklärte sie: ""Objektivierung wird als respektlos und entmenschlichend angesehen.""

Probleme de drepturi de autor pentru noul album al rapperului Kanye West/ Ozzy Osbourne a refuzat să-și dea acordul în privința folosirii pieselor,"Probleme de drepturi de autor pentru noul album al rapperului Kanye West/ Ozzy Osbourne a refuzat să-și dea acordul în privința folosirii pieselor
Noul album al rapperului Kanye West, „Vultures” în colaborare cu Ty Dolla $ign a fost, în sfârșit, lansat, dar nu fără controverse.
Rapperul american este acuzat de artiști precum Ozzy Osbourne și Donna Summer că a folosit bucăți din piesele lor chiar și după ce i-a fost refuzată permisiunea.
„Primim atât de multe cereri pentru aceste cântece, iar când am văzut această cerere, am spus pur și simplu că nu se poate”, a declarat Sharon Osbourne pentru Billboard.
Fostul lider al trupei Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne, l-a criticat vineri, 9 februarie, pe Kanye West pe rețelele de socializare, spunând că acesta i-a cerut o mostră dintr-un cântec, dar că i s-a „refuzat permisiunea pentru că este antisemit” și că a folosit oricum mostra la un eveniment de ascultare a noului său album, organizat joi la United Center din Chicago. „Nu vreau nicio asociere cu acest om!” a scris Osbourne.
Deși Osbourne a declarat online că West i-a cerut să cânte „War Pigs”, piesa pe care se pare că a folosit-o este „Iron Man” – mai exact o versiune interpretată de trupa solo a lui Ozzy Osbourne la Festivalul Us din 1983.
„Primim atât de multe cereri pentru aceste cântece”, a declarat soția și managerul său, Sharon Osbourne, pentru Billboard, „iar când am văzut acea cerere, am spus pur și simplu că nu se poate.” Fără permisiune, West nu ar putea lansa o nouă melodie care să folosească sample-ul. „Am luat legătura cu echipa lui” în legătură cu problema juridică”, spune Sharon Osbourne. „Și este, de asemenea, o problemă de a avea respect pentru un alt artist”.
O situație asemăntoare vizează și piesa „Good (Don’t Die” de pe noul album al artistului. Piesa interpolează în mod neautorizat o parte a hitului „I Feel Love” din 1977 al Donnei Summer, susține familia regretatei cântărețe citată de Billboard.
„Kanye West… a cerut permisiunea de a folosi cântecul I Feel Love al Donnei Summer, a fost refuzat… a schimbat cuvintele, a pus pe cineva să îl cânte din nou sau a folosit AI, dar este I Feel Love… încălcarea drepturilor de autor!!!”, se arată într-o declarație postată într-un Instagram Story pe contul oficial Donna Summer sâmbătă, 10 februarie.
Începând din 2022, West, cunoscut acum sub numele simplu de Ye, a făcut o serie de comentarii antisemite, pentru care a fost blamat pe scară largă, și a pierdut numeroase contracte de sponsorizare și de modă.",2024-02-11T08:51:33Z,https://www.g4media.ro,G4Media.ro
"Kanye West criticized by Ozzy Osbourne, Donna Summer's estate for allegedly using uncleared samples for new album","Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and the estate of the late singer Donna Summer, both publicly accused Kanye West of using recordings of their music without permission for the rapper's latest album.
West's album ""Vultures 1"" — a collaboration with singer and rapper Ty Dolla $ign — hit streaming services early Saturday morning.
""Vultures 1"" was previewed at the United Center in Chicago on Thursday night, and clips from the show proliferated on social media, teasing a song ""Carnival"" that Osbourne took issue with for allegedly sampling a clip from a 1983 live performance of the Black Sabbath song ""Iron Man.""
In a social media post Friday, Osbourne wrote that West, who performs under the name Ye, had ""asked permission to sample a section of a 1983 live performance of 'Iron Man' from the US Festival without vocals & was refused permission because he is an antisemite and has caused untold heartache to many.""
Osbourne, who was nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Saturday, went on to allege that West ""went ahead and used the sample anyway at his album listening party last night. I want no association with this man!""
West had previously sampled ""Iron Man"" in his 2010 song ""Hell of a Life"" — a section of which replaced the uncleared sample in the final version of ""Carnival"" which was released Saturday.
CBS News has reached out to representatives of both Osbourne and West.
The estate of the late singer Donna Summer also alleged in a social media post Saturday that West used her 1977 hit ""I Feel Love without their permission on the new album track ""Good (Don't Die).""
In a statement posted to the late singer's Instagram account, her estate wrote that ""Kanye West…asked permission to use Donna Summer's song I Feel Love, he was denied… he changed the words, had someone re sing it or used AI but it's I Feel Love… copyright infringement!!!"" the post read.
Television personality Sharon Osbourne, wife of Ozzy Osbourne, was tagged in the post. In her own social media post Saturday, Sharon Osbourne wrote that ""the Osbourne family have never wanted any association with Kanye West.""
""I Feel Love"" was prominently sampled in Beyonce's 2022 song ""Summer Renaissance.""
Beginning in 2022, the ""Heartless"" rapper faced significant backlash for a series of antisemitic statements which resulted in multiple suspensions of his then-Twitter and Instagram accounts. The ensuing fallout from his antisemitic comments was immense. He was dropped from lucrative partnership deals with Adidas and Gap, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago rescinded his honorary degree. Comedian Stephen Colbert also banned him from CBS' ""The Late Show.""
West's X and Instagram accounts have since been reinstated.
This also isn't the first time West has had an uncleared sample recreated. On his debut album ""The College Dropout,"" rap legend Lauryn Hill famously denied clearing her song ""Mystery of Iniquity"" for use. In the final version, Chicago singer Syleena Johnson is credited with a feature for filling in the vocals.",2024-02-11T02:46:05Z,https://www.cbsnews.com,CBS News
"Kanye West & Ty Dolla Sign Team Up With Rich The Kid & Playboi Carti For ""Carnival""","Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign's new album, Vultures 1, is finally here featuring a number of star-studded collaborations across its 16 tracks. One of the early standouts is ""Carnival"" featuring contributions from Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti. The song is getting plenty of attention for more than just its merits alone, with a headline-grabbing reference to Taylor Swift, a behind-the-scenes feud with Ozzy Osbourne, and more.
As for Swift, Ye raps in the third verse: ""I made six Taylor Swift (Ha) since I had the Rollie on the wrist (Ha) / I'm the new Jesus, b*tch (Ha), I turn water to crist (Ha)."" It's not the first time he's mentioned Swift. He made endless headlines in 2016 with the song, ""Famous,"" for similarly remarking that he's the reason for her success.

As for his back-and-forth with Osbourne, the singer was unhappy with West's performance of ""Carnival,"" earlier this week, which featured a sample of a live cover of Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" that the lead singer performed with his solo band in 1983. Osbourne took to social media to complain that he never gave permission for its usage. “.@KANYEWEST ASKED PERMISSION TO SAMPLE A SECTION OF A 1983 LIVE PERFORMANCE OF ‘IRON MAN’ FROM THE US FESTIVAL WITHOUT VOCALS & WAS REFUSED PERMISSION BECAUSE HE IS AN ANTISEMITE AND HAS CAUSED UNTOLD HEARTACHE TO MANY,"" he wrote. ""HE WENT AHEAD AND USED THE SAMPLE ANYWAY AT HIS ALBUM LISTENING PARTY LAST NIGHT. I WANT NO ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN.”
Ye previously sampled Black Sabbath on his song, “Hell of a Life."" It's not the only sample clearance drama West has dealt with this week, as the estate of Donna Summer also called him out. Be on the lookout for further updates on Kanye West and Ty Dolla Sign on HotNewHipHop.

Go, go, go, go
Head so good, she a honor roll
She'll ride the dick like a carnival
I done did the impossible
