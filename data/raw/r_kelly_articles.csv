Coi Leray Disowns Her Father Benzino After Shocking R Kelly Comments,"Benzino knows how to drum up controversy. The former editor of The Source Magazine has made a career out of it. Few people would know he was a rapper were it not for his highly-publicized beef with Eminem during the 2000s. Unfortunately, Benzino's knack for making bold statements has come back to bite him. He recently went on the We In Miami podcast, where he declared that R Kelly should be given a second chance despite his heinous crimes. This proved to be the last straw for Benzino's daughter, Coi Leray, who publicly denounced their relationship.
Leray posted an X (formerly Twitter) thread on May 1 to clarify her stance on Benzino's comments. She did not mention R. Kelly by name, but it was obvious she did not agree with her father. ""I want everybody to know I want nothing to do with anything my father has going on,"" she wrote. ""I haven’t spoken to him in over a year and I don’t condone or respect any of them interviews he got going on."" The rapper went on to explain that she does even want to be associated with Benzino in the future. ""I don’t respect his decisions,"" she added. ""I want nothing to do with him please don't even think of me when you see him.""

Coi Leray Wants ""Nothing To Do"" With Her Dad
Coi Leray doubled down on her feelings towards her father in a second tweet. ""Sharing the same DNA and blood doesn't make us family,"" she noted. ""Loyalty, boundaries, respect, teaching, guidance, love, patience, encouragement makes us family... Keep me away from people who try to 'get their lick back' please."" The rapper then told followers that she looks forward to having a child of her own so that she could put what she's learned into practice. ""I can’t wait to have a kid one day,"" she concluded. ""I can’t wait to look her/him in the eye and tell them how much I love them.""
As sad as this exchange is, Benzino and Coi Leray's estrangement is not surprising. The father and daughter have gone through a very public cycle of beefing and then making up over the years. Leray criticized Benzino for harassing her mother back in 2022, and went against her father when he tried to revive his beef with Eminem the same year. ""Let’s build bridges and get over them before you burn the bridge and burn with it,"" she said at the time. Unfortunately, the time for building bridges with Benzino seems to have come to an end.

THE BIG STORY: Drake, Tupac & An AI Showdown
The debate over unauthorized voice cloning burst into the open last week when Tupac Shakur’s estate threatened to sue Drake over a recent diss track against Kendrick Lamar that featured an AI-generated version of the late rapper’s voice.
In a cease-and-desist letter first reported by Billboard, litigator Howard King told Drake that the Shakur estate was “deeply dismayed and disappointed” by the rapper’s use of Tupac’s voice in his “Taylor Made Freestyle.” The letter warned Drake to confirm in less than 24 hours that he would pull the track down or the estate would “pursue all of its legal remedies” against him.
“Not only is the record a flagrant violation of Tupac’s publicity and the estate’s legal rights, it is also a blatant abuse of the legacy of one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time. The Estate would never have given its approval for this use.”
AI-powered voice cloning has been top of mind for the music industry since last spring when an unknown artist released a track called “Heart On My Sleeve” that featured — ironically — fake verses from Drake’s voice. As such fake vocals have continued to proliferate on the internet, industry groups, legal experts and lawmakers have wrangled over how best to crack down on them.
With last week’s showdown, that debate jumped from hypothetical to reality. The Tupac estate laid out actual legal arguments for why it believed Drake’s use of the late rapper’s voice violated the law. And those arguments were apparently persuasive: Within 24 hours, Drake began to pull his song from the internet.

MEGAN THEE STALLION SUED – The rapper and Roc Nation were hit with a lawsuit from a cameraman named Emilio Garcia who claims he was forced to watch Megan have sex with a woman inside a moving vehicle while she was on tour in Spain. The lawsuit, which claims he was subjected to a hostile workplace, was filed by the same attorneys who sued Lizzo last year over similar employment law.
BRITNEY SETTLES WITH FATHER – Britney Spears settled her long-running legal dispute with her father, Jamie Spears, that arose following the termination of the pop star’s 13-year conservatorship in 2021. Attorneys for Britney had accused Jamie of misconduct during the years he served as his daughter’s conservator, a charge he adamantly denied. The terms of last week’s agreement were not made public.
TRAVIS SCOTT MUST FACE TRIAL – A Houston judge denied a motion from Travis Scott to be dismissed from the sprawling litigation over the 2021 disaster at the Astroworld music festival, leaving him to face a closely-watched jury trial next month. Scott’s attorneys had argued that the star could not be held legally liable since safety and security at live events is “not the job of performing artists.” But the judge overseeing the case denied that motion without written explanation.
ASTROWORLD TRIAL LIVESTREAM? Also in the Astroworld litigation, plaintiffs’ attorneys argued that the upcoming trial — a pivotal first test for hundreds of other lawsuits filed by alleged victims over the disaster — should be broadcast live to the public. “The devastating scale of the events at Astroworld, combined with the involvement of high-profile defendants, has generated significant national attention and a legitimate public demand for transparency and accountability,” the lawyers wrote.
BALLERINI HACKING CASE – Just a week after Kelsea Ballerini sued a former fan named Bo Ewing over accusations that he hacked her and leaked her unreleased album, his attorneys reached a deal with her legal team in which he agreed not to share her songs with anyone else — and to name any people he’s already sent them to. “Defendant shall, within thirty days of entry of this order, provide plaintiffs with the names and contact information for all people to whom defendant disseminated the recordings,” the agreement read.
R. KELLY CONVICTIONS AFFIRMED – A federal appeals court upheld R. Kelly’s 2022 convictions in Chicago on child pornography and enticement charges, rejecting his argument that the case against him was filed too late. The court said that Kelly was convicted by “an even-handed jury” and that “no statute of limitations saves him.” His attorney vowed a trip to the U.S. Supreme Court, though such appeals face long odds.
DIDDY RESPONDS TO SUIT – Lawyers for Sean “Diddy” Combs pushed back against a sexual assault lawsuit filed by a woman named Joi Dickerson-Neal, arguing that he should not face claims under statutes that did not exist when the alleged incidents occurred in 1991. His attorneys want the claims — such as revenge porn and human trafficking — to be dismissed from the broader case, which claims that Combs drugged, assaulted and surreptitiously filmed Dickerson-Neal when she was 19 years old.",2024-04-30T21:52:56Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
R. Kelly tem sentença por pornografia infantil confirmada,"Washigton | AFP
Um tribunal federal de apelações dos Estados Unidos confirmou a sentença de 20 anos de prisão imposta ao cantor R. Kelly por pornografia infantil e outros crimes.
Kelly foi condenado em fevereiro de 2023, mas os advogados argumentaram que o prazo de prescrição havia sido superado quando ele foi acusado, uma alegação que o tribunal de Chicago rejeitou na sexta-feira.

""Durante anos, Robert Sylvester Kelly abusou de meninas menores de idade. Ao recorrer a um esquema complexo para manter as vítimas caladas, ele evitou durante muito tempo as consequências"", escreveu a juíza Amy St. Eve em sua decisão.
""Estes crimes finalmente o alcançaram. Mas Kelly —apresentando uma defesa de prescrição— acredita que atrasou as acusações por tempo suficiente para evitá-las completamente. O estatuto diz o contrário, então confirmamos a condenação"".
Kelly, 57 anos, já cumpre uma pena de 30 anos por uma condenação de extorsão e tráfico sexual, determinada por um júri de um tribunal do Brooklyn em um julgamento federal separado.
As duas sentenças serão cumpridas simultaneamente, o que totalizaria 31 anos de prisão.
A advogada Jennifer Bonjean afirmou que R. Kelly vai recorrer à Suprema Corte.
O artista foi condenado por um tribunal de Nova York em setembro de 2022 por seis das 13 acusações apresentadas: três por produzir pornografia infantil e três por aliciamento de menores de idade .
A condenação federal em Chicago ocorreu um ano depois e foi considerada um marco pelo movimento #MeToo: foi o primeiro grande julgamento de abuso sexual em que a maioria das acusadoras eram mulheres negras.
Também foi a primeira vez que R. Kelly enfrentou consequências criminais pelos abusos que, durante décadas, ele teria infligido a mulheres e menores de idade.
Nascido em Chicago, o artista conquistou a fama nos anos 1990 com sucessos como ""I Believe I Can Fly"" e se tornou uma das maiores estrelas do R&B.",2024-04-27T21:21:00Z,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br,Folha de S.Paulo

R Kelly loses appeal to overturn 20-year sentence for child sex abuse,"R Kelly's challenge against a 20-year sentence for child sex convictions has been quashed by an appeals court.
The singer was correctly sentenced to 20 years in prison, a Chicago court ruled on Friday.
He was convicted in 2022 on three charges of producing child sexual abuse images and three charges of enticement of minors for sex.
In his appeal, Kelly, 57, argued Illinois' old statute of limitations - which required prosecution of child sex crime charges within 10 years - should have applied, rather than the current law permitting charges while an accuser is still alive.
The appeals court rejected this, labelling it an attempt by Kelly to elude the charges entirely after ""employing a complex scheme to keep victims quiet"".
He also argued that charges involving one accuser should have been tried separately from the charges tied to three other accusers due to video evidence that became a focal point of the Chicago trial.
Prosecutors have said the video showed Kelly abusing a girl. The accuser, only identified as Jane, testified for the first time that she was 14 when the video was taken.
The three-judge panel from the appeals court noted jurors acquitted Kelly on seven of the 13 counts against him ""even after viewing those abhorrent tapes"".

Chicago appeals court rejects R. Kelly ‘s challenge of 20-year sentence,"In his appeal, Kelly argued that Illinois’ former and shorter statute of limitations on child sex crime prosecutions should have applied to his Chicago case rather than current law permitting charges while an accuser is still alive read more
The singer R. Kelly was correctly sentenced to 20 years in prison on child sex convictions in Chicago, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.
Jurors in 2022 convicted the Grammy Award-winning R&B singer, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, on three charges of producing child sexual abuse images and three charges of enticement of minors for sex.
In his appeal, Kelly argued that Illinois’ former and shorter statute of limitations on child sex crime prosecutions should have applied to his Chicago case rather than current law permitting charges while an accuser is still alive.

He also argued that charges involving one accuser should have been tried separately from the charges tied to three other accusers due to video evidence that became a focal point of the Chicago trial.
Federal prosecutors have said the video showed Kelly abusing a girl. The accuser identified only as Jane testified for the first time that she was 14 when the video was taken.
The three-judge panel from the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Friday’s ruling noted that jurors acquitted Kelly on 7 of the 13 counts against him “even after viewing those abhorrent tapes.”
The appeals court also rejected Kelly’s argument that he should not have been prosecuted since the allegations occurred while Illinois law required prosecution of child sex crime charges within ten years. The panel labeled it an attempt by Kelly to elude the charges entirely after “employing a complex scheme to keep victims quiet.”
In a written statement, Kelly’s attorney Jennifer Bonjean said they plan to seek U.S. Supreme Court review of the decision and “pursue all of his appellate remedies until we free R. Kelly .”
“We are disappointed in the ruling, but our fight is far from over,” she said.
Prosecutors in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago had sought an even tougher sentence, asking for 25 years. They also wanted a judge to not let that time begin until after Kelly completed a 30-year sentence imposed in 2022 in New York for federal racketeering and sex trafficking convictions.

US-Sänger: R. Kelly scheitert nach Missbrauchsurteil mit Berufungsantrag,"Ein weiterer Rückschlag für den Sänger R. Kelly: Der wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs zu zwei langen Haftstrafen verurteilte US-Sänger ist mit einem Berufungsantrag bei einem Gericht in Chicago gescheitert. Das Gericht bestätigte US-Medien zufolge ein früheres Urteil aus dem Jahr 2022 gegen den Sänger. Eine Jury in Chicago befand Kelly damals für schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben. Er wurde in diesem Fall zu 20 Jahren Haft verurteilt. Der Richter legte fest, dass Kelly seine Haftstrafen größtenteils parallel absitzen darf. Wenige Monate zuvor war der Sänger in New York unter anderem wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs Minderjähriger zu einer Haftstrafe von 30 Jahren verurteilt worden.
In Kellys Berufungsantrag in Chicago ging es unter anderem um die Länge der Strafe. Ihr Kampf gegen das Urteil sei noch nicht vorbei, teilte seine Anwältin Jennifer Bonjean der Onlineplattform TMZ.com zufolge mit. Auch in New York läuft eine Berufung. Im März argumentierten die Anwälte des Musikers dort in einer Anhörung, dass die Staatsanwaltschaft nicht ausreichend Beweise vorgelegt und dass er keinen fairen Prozess bekommen habe. Der Sänger wurde 2022 in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt, nachdem eine Jury ihn in neun Anklagepunkten – darunter sexuelle Ausbeutung Minderjähriger, Kidnapping und Bestechung – schuldig befunden hatte.
Der in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborene Musiker hatte mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben und diversen wichtigen Auszeichnungen einst zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern seiner Generation gehört. Schon seit den 90er Jahren gab es aber Anschuldigungen wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs gegen ihn. Als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation Surviving R. Kelly die Vorwürfe zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer. Stars distanzierten sich von ihm, zudem Radiosender, Streaming-Dienste und sein Musiklabel. Er war im Sommer 2019 festgenommen und angeklagt worden.",2024-04-26T23:02:41Z,https://www.zeit.de,ZEIT ONLINE
la condamnation du chanteur R. Kelly à 20 ans de prison confirmée,"La condamnation à 20 ans de prison pour pédopornographie du chanteur américain R. Kelly, star déchue du R&B déjà condamné à 30 ans de prison pour crimes sexuels, a été confirmée en appel.
Une cour fédérale à Chicago a rejeté vendredi les arguments de la défense de Robert Sylvester Kelly, 57 ans, qui invoquait le dépassement du délai de prescription pour les poursuites.
A la tête d'un « système » d'exploitation sexuelle
L'artiste, mondialement connu pour son tube I Believe I Can Fly et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, avait longtemps régné sur le R&B malgré des soupçons d'agressions sexuelles.
Il avait été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 d'avoir piloté pendant des années un « système » d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes, et condamné en juin 2022 à 30 ans de prison par un tribunal fédéral à New York, peine qu'il purge actuellement.
En février 2023, il avait également été condamné à vingt ans de prison pour production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur. Le juge avait ordonné qu'il n'exécute qu'un an de prison supplémentaire quand il aurait purgé sa première condamnation.
Ses « crimes l'ont enfin rattrapé »
« Des années durant, Robert Sylvester Kelly a commis des violences sexuelles sur des jeunes filles mineures », selon le jugement prononcé vendredi. « En utilisant un schéma complexe pour faire taire les victimes, il a longtemps esquivé les conséquences » mais « ces crimes l'ont enfin rattrapé ».
L'avocate du chanteur, Jennifer Bonjean, a déclaré qu'il ferait appel devant la Cour suprême. « Nous sommes déçus du jugement mais notre combat est loin d'être terminé », a-t-elle assuré dans un communiqué selon des médias américains.
Des accords financiers pour faire taire les victimes
Les procès contre R. Kelly ont été perçus comme une étape majeure du mouvement #MeToo : pour la première fois, la majorité des plaignantes étaient des femmes noires accusant un artiste noir et obtenant justice.
Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur des jeunes filles, dont l'une n'avait que 14 ans, avaient été diffusés pendant le procès.
Pendant des décennies, le succès de R. Kelly avait été émaillé de soupçons de violences sexuelles, objets de rumeurs persistantes. Il était longtemps parvenu à les faire taire avec des accords financiers prévoyant des clauses de confidentialité.
Marié à la chanteuse Aaliyah, 15 ans
Le chanteur, une des plus grandes célébrités américaines des années 1990, avait été brièvement marié, en 1994, avec la jeune star de 15 ans Aaliyah, dont les parents avaient ensuite fait annuler le mariage. La chanteuse et actrice est décédée dans un accident d'avion en 2001.
Les premières accusations contre le chanteur avaient émergé il y a plus de vingt ans. Il avait été inculpé en 2002 pour avoir filmé des actes sexuels entre lui et une jeune fille de 14 ans, mais finalement acquitté en 2008.
Sa maison de disques RCA, filiale de Sony Music, l'avait lâché début 2019 après un documentaire l'accusant de multiples agressions sexuelles et en février de la même année il avait été inculpé d'agressions sexuelles notamment sur des mineures.",2024-04-26T22:00:00Z,https://www.leprogres.fr,Le Progrès
Nach Missbrauchsurteil: R. Kellys Berufungsantrag scheitert,"Das sieht nicht gut aus für R. Kelly (57)! Im Jahr 2022 wurde der US-amerikanische R&B-Sänger von einer Jury in Chicago zu 20 Jahren Haft verurteilt. Der Grund: Er soll Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt haben. Dieses Urteil wollten der Musikproduzent und seine Anwälte jedoch nicht akzeptieren. Die Juristen argumentierten, dass der Fall schon längst verjährt sei und legten deshalb Berufung ein. Mit diesem Antrag hatten sie jedoch keinen Erfolg. Wie TMZ nun berichtet, hat das Gericht das Urteil inklusive der 20-jährigen Haftstrafe am Freitag erneut bestätigt. Trotz dieser Niederlage wollen sich die Berater des Musikers noch nicht geschlagen geben. ""Unser Kampf ist noch lange nicht vorbei"", macht jetzt seine Anwältin im Gespräch mit dem US-Magazin deutlich.
Derzeit bereiten sich die Juristen des Songwriters auf eine weitere Berufung vor, die in New York stattfinden wird. In diesem Bundesstaat wurde der Sänger im Jahr 2022 zu ganzen 30 Jahren Haft wegen sexueller Ausbeutung Minderjähriger, Kidnapping und Bestechung für schuldig befunden. Auch dieses Urteil fechten seine Anwälte momentan an. Sie finden, ihr Mandant hätte damals keinen fairen Prozess bekommen. Da das erste Verfahren kurz nach der Veröffentlichung der Dokumentation ""Surviving R. Kelly"" stattgefunden hatte, sei die Jury voreingenommen gewesen. Wird er mit dieser Berufung mehr Erfolg haben?
Der Fall Harvey Weinstein (72) zeigt, dass Berufungen sehr wohl erfolgreich sein können. Vor wenigen Tagen hob ein Gericht in New York sein Gefängnisurteil wieder auf. Der Filmmogul war im Februar 2020 wegen sexueller Nötigung und Vergewaltigung zu 23 Jahren Haftstrafe verurteilt worden. Seine Anwälte haben jedoch einen Fehler im Verfahren gefunden, sodass das Gericht den Schuldspruch für unwirksam erklärte. Die Schauspielerin Ashley Judd (56), die neben zahlreichen weiteren Frauen Anschuldigungen gegen den 72-Jährigen erhoben hatte, zeigt sich frustriert. ""Wir leben noch immer unsere Wahrheit. Und wir wissen, was passiert ist"", betonte sie gegenüber New York Times.

Where Is R. Kelly Now? Updates on His Sentencing & More,"R. Kelly‘s lengthy criminal history and accusations date back to the early 1990s. Throughout the early 2000s, he faced sexual abuse allegations until he was eventually convicted of child pornography in 2022. Although Kelly vowed he’d appeal his decades-long prison sentencing, the former record producer’s appeal was denied in 2024.
Learn more about R. Kelly’s case and get updates on where he is below.
What Did R. Kelly Do?
Although most of Kelly’s accusations date back to the early 1990s, a leaked recording of his alleged sexual encounter with a minor didn’t surface until 2002. The recording showed Kelly and an unidentified teenager, who was a minor at the time. After he was indicted on child pornography charges, he pleaded not guilty. His trial began in 2008, and Kelly was acquitted.
Over the following decade, multiple women came forward with startling accusations against the former singer-songwriter. In 2019, Kelly was charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse. He denied all charges against him, and his legal team entered not guilty pleas. Nevertheless, he was indicted by a federal grand jury that year on charges including child pornography, enticement of a minor and obstruction of justice, per the Associated Press.
Kelly’s federal trial began in 2021 in New York. He was convicted of violating the Mann Act — an anti-sex trafficking law that prohibits a person from taking anyone across state lines “for any immoral purpose,” per the outlet.
R. Kelly’s Prison Sentencing
In 2022, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years behind bars in New York. Later that year, a jury in Chicago convicted him of three child pornography counts and three counts of the enticement of a child. The jury acquitted him, however, on the following: a fourth pornography count, a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge in connected to his 2008 trial, three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and two additional enticement charges.
In 2023, a federal Chicago judge sentenced Kelly to 20 years in prison for child pornography and enticement of a minor charges. He was reportedly ordered to serve prison time for all but one of those simultaneously with his separate 30-year prison sentencing, which was for racketeering and sex trafficking convictions in New York. In 2024, an appeals court in Chicago upheld his 20-year prison sentence for his child sex convictions.
Is R. Kelly in Prison?
As of April 2023, Kelly has been at FCI Butner, North Carolina, per the AP. He was initially at the Metropolitan Correctional Center Chicago.
When Is R. Kelly’s Release Date From Prison?
According to the Chicago-Sun Times, Kelly is currently expected to be released from prison in 2045.",2024-04-26T21:03:11Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife

Kriminalität: R. Kelly mit Berufungsantrag gescheitert,"Der wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs zu zwei langjährigen Haftstrafen verurteilte US-Sänger R. Kelly (57) ist mit einem Berufungsantrag bei einem Gericht in Chicago gescheitert. Das zuständige Berufungsgericht bestätigte ein früheres Urteil aus dem Jahr 2022 gegen den «I Believe I Can Fly»-Sänger, wie US-Medien berichteten.
Eine Jury in Chicago befand Kelly damals schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben. Er wurde in diesem Fall zu 20 Jahren Haft verurteilt. Der Richter legte fest, dass Kelly seine Haftstrafen größtenteils parallel absitzen darf. Wenige Monate zuvor war der Sänger in New York unter anderem wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs Minderjähriger zu einer Haftstrafe von 30 Jahren verurteilt worden.
Kellys Berufungsantrag in Chicago drehte sich unter anderem um die Länge der Strafe. Ihr Kampf gegen das Urteil sei noch nicht vorbei, teilte seine Anwältin Jennifer Bonjean laut «TMZ.com» mit. Auch in New York läuft eine Berufung. Im März argumentierten die Anwälte des Musikers dort bei einer Anhörung, dass die Staatsanwaltschaft nicht ausreichend Beweise vorgelegt und dass er keinen fairen Prozess bekommen habe. Der Sänger erhielt 2022 in New York 30 Jahre Haft, nachdem eine Jury ihn in neun Anklagepunkten - darunter sexuelle Ausbeutung Minderjähriger, Kidnapping und Bestechung - schuldig befunden hatte.
Der in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborene Musiker hatte mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben und diversen wichtigen Auszeichnungen einst zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern seiner Generation gehört. Schon seit den 90er Jahren gab es aber Anschuldigungen wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs gegen ihn. Als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation «Surviving R. Kelly» die Vorwürfe zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer. Stars distanzierten sich von ihm, zudem Radiosender, Streaming-Dienste und sein Musiklabel. Er war im Sommer 2019 festgenommen und angeklagt worden.

R. Kelly’s Sex Abuse Conviction in Chicago Upheld on Appeal,"A federal appeals court on Friday (April 26) upheld R. Kelly’s conviction on child pornography and enticement charges, rejecting his argument that the case against him was filed too late.
Eighteen months after a federal jury in Chicago found Kelly (Robert Sylvester Kelly) guilty, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the 2022 guilty verdict, saying that he had been convicted by “an even-handed jury” and that “no statute of limitations saves him.”
“For years, Robert Sylvester Kelly abused underage girls. By employing a complex scheme to keep victims quiet, he long evaded consequences,” Judge Amy St. Eve wrote for a three-judge panel. “In recent years, though, those crimes caught up with him at last. But Kelly — interposing a statute-of-limitations defense — thinks he delayed the charges long enough to elude them entirely. The statute says otherwise, so we affirm his conviction.”
Trending on Billboard
Friday’s ruling affirms one of Kelly’s two felony sex abuse convictions. The other one — a September 2021 guilty verdict on racketeering charges brought by federal prosecutors in New York — is currently pending on appeal.
In the wake of Friday’s decision, Kelly can now appeal the verdict to the U.S. Supreme Court. But such appeals face extremely long odds, as the high court hears only a tiny fraction of the petitions it receives.
In a statement to Billboard on Friday, Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said: “We are disappointed in the ruling but our fight is far from over. We will seek review from the Supreme Court and continue to pursue all of his appellate remedies until we Free R. Kelly. You can bet on that.”
After decades of accusations of sexual misconduct, Kelly was indicted in 2019 by federal prosecutors in both New York and Illinois. By the end of 2022, he had been convicted in both cases.
In Brooklyn, the feds accused Kelly of violating the federal RICO statute (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) by orchestrating a long-running scheme to recruit and abuse women and underage girls. After being convicted in September 2021, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
In Chicago, a different team of federal prosecutors accused Kelly of violating child pornography laws, enticing minors for sex and obstructing justice by upending a 2008 criminal trial. Though he was acquitted on certain counts, Kelly was convicted in September 2022. The judge later sentenced him to 20 years in prison, but the vast majority of that sentence will be served concurrently with the New York sentence.
In appealing the Chicago verdict, Kelly’s attorneys argued that the case — over crimes that allegedly occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s — had been filed well past the statute of limitations that existed at the time, which barred child sex abuse charges after a victim’s 25th birthday.
But in Friday’s ruling, the judges chose instead to apply the modern statute of limitations, which extends through the life of the victim.
“Kelly maintains that the old, pre-2003 statute of limitations should control,” Judge St. Eve wrote. “All the inducement of minors in this case, he points out, took place when he could expect a more generous statute of limitations. The law does not support Kelly’s position.”
The appeals court also rejected several other arguments from Kelly, including one challenging the procedural fairness of his trial and another against the propriety of his sentence.
With Kelly’s Chicago verdict affirmed, attention now turns to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which is currently weighing his Brooklyn conviction. That case was argued in court last month, when Bonjean told the judges that the RICO case against Kelly had stretched federal racketeering laws “to the point of absurdity.”",2024-04-26T17:31:29Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

CHICAGO – The singer R. Kelly was correctly sentenced to 20 years in prison on child sex convictions in Chicago, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.
Jurors in 2022 convicted the Grammy Award-winning R&B singer, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, on three charges of producing child porn and three charges of enticement of minors for sex.
Recommended Videos
In his appeal, Kelly argued that Illinois' former and shorter statute of limitations on child sex prosecutions should have applied to his Chicago case rather than current law permitting charges while an accuser is still alive.
He also argued that charges involving one accuser should have been tried separately from the charges tied to three other accusers due to video evidence that became a focal point of the Chicago trial.
State prosecutors have said the video showed Kelly abusing a girl. The accuser identified only as Jane testified for the first time that she was 14 when the video was taken.
The three-judge panel from the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Friday's ruling noted that jurors acquitted Kelly on 7 of the 13 counts against him “even after viewing those abhorrent tapes.""
The appeals court also rejected Kelly's argument that he should not have been prosecuted since the allegations occurred while Illinois law required prosecution of child sex crime charges within ten years. The panel labeled it an attempt by Kelly to elude the charges entirely after “employing a complex scheme to keep victims quiet.”
In a written statement, Kelly’s attorney Jennifer Bonjean said they plan to seek U.S. Supreme Court review of the decision and “pursue all of his appellate remedies until we free R. Kelly.”
“We are disappointed in the ruling, but our fight is far from over,” she said.
Prosecutors in Kelly's hometown of Chicago had sought an even tougher sentence, asking for 25 years. They also wanted a judge to not let that time begin until after Kelly completed a 30-year sentence imposed in 2022 in New York for federal racketeering and sex trafficking convictions.
Judge Harry Leinenweber rejected that ask, ordering that Kelly serve the 20 years from the Chicago case simultaneously with the New York sentence.
Kelly has separately appealed the New York sentence.
In arguments last month before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, attorney Jennifer Bonjean asked the panel to find that prosecutors improperly used a racketeering statute written to shut down organized crime to go after the singer.",2024-04-26T16:48:43Z,https://www.clickondetroit.com,WDIV ClickOnDetroit
R. Kelly's conviction in Chicago case is affirmed,"R. Kelly’s sex-crime conviction and 20-year sentence in Chicago’s federal court will stand, an appeals court ruled Friday in a blistering opinion.
“For years, Robert Sylvester Kelly abused underage girls. By employing a complex scheme to keep victims quiet, he long evaded consequences. In recent years, though, those crimes caught up with him at last,” Judge Amy St. Eve of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals wrote in the terse, 14-page ruling.
“But Kelly — interposing a statute-of-limitations defense — thinks he delayed the charges long enough to elude them entirely. The statute says otherwise, so we affirm his conviction.”
The appellate court also denied Kelly’s request for resentencing, saying they had no grounds to second-guess the 20-year prison term U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber handed down.
“An even-handed jury found Kelly guilty, acquitting him on several charges even after viewing those abhorrent tapes,” the appellate ruling states. “No statute of limitations saves him, and the resulting sentence was procedurally proper and — especially under these appalling circumstances — substantively fair.”
Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, told the Tribune Friday that they were still weighing whether to request a rehearing before the full 7th Circuit panel — a move that is rarely granted.
Meanwhile, Bonjean says she plans to petition the U.S. Supreme Court on the statute of limitations issue, which centers on whether a new law passed after the underlying crimes in Kelly’s case should have been applied.
“We believe that is an appropriate issue for review by the Supreme Court,” Bonjean said.
Kelly, 57, is serving his time at a medium-security facility in Butner, North Carolina. His current release date is Dec. 21, 2045, when he’d be a couple weeks shy of his 79th birthday, federal prison records show.
Bonjean said she just spoke to Kelly on Thursday and that he remained “optimistic” about his remaining appeals.
“He understands that this is a process, that the fight is not over and he’s optimistic that the truth will eventually prevail,” she said.
A federal jury in Chicago convicted Kelly in 2022 on child pornography charges for explicit videos he made of himself and his then 14-year-old goddaughter, “Jane.” Kelly was also found guilty of inappropriate sexual relations with Jane and two other teenage girls, “Pauline” and “Nia.” The jury acquitted Kelly on separate charges of conspiring to rig his prior Cook County child pornography trial.
Kelly abused the three girls in the 1990s, when the law allowed prosecutors to bring such charges until the victims turned 25. Congress in 2003 expanded the statute of limitations up until the victim’s death, but on appeal Bonjean argued lawmakers never intended that amendment to apply retroactively. Prosecutors could not have brought these charges any later than 2009, she said.
Kelly is also appealing his conviction in a separate federal case out of New York, where a jury found him guilty of broad racketeering charges. He was sentenced to 30 years in the case; most of his prison term for the Chicago conviction is to be served concurrently.
During arguments in February on the Chicago case, St. Eve seemed skeptical, noting that no federal circuit has yet sided with Bonjean’s position.
Prosecutors argued that Congress expanded the statute of limitations long before it otherwise would have expired for Jane, Nia and Pauline. That’s a deadline extension, not a retroactive application of the law, they argued.
Case law overwhelmingly rejects Kelly’s claims, the appellate court ruled in Friday’s order.
“(It) is not unconstitutional to apply a newer statute of limitations to old conduct when the defendant was subject to prosecution at the time of the change, as Kelly was in 2003,” the ruling states.
The higher court also shot down Kelly’s argument that the counts involving Jane, including the child pornography charges, should have been tried separately from the rest.

RI's R. Kelly Sheridan joins board of Lawyers Defending American Democracy,"While he could spend retirement focusing on two of his favorite hobbies (cycling and golf), he decided to join the board for Lawyers Defending American Democracy (LDAD), a newish organization that seeks to “galvanize lawyers to defend the rule of law in the face of an unprecedented threat to American democracy.”
He’s a retired partner at Roberts, Carroll, Feldstein & Peirce, where he was one of the best-known lobbyists in the state, and is a former president of the Rhode Island Bar Association and chairman of the Champlin Foundation.
If you’ve been around Rhode Island legal, political, and civic circles over the last couple of decades, there’s a good chance you’ve crossed paths with R. Kelly Sheridan.
Advertisement
LDAD has made headlines recently for calling for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from the case involving former president Donald Trump, so I asked Sheridan to tell us more about the work the organization is doing.
Get Rhode Map A weekday briefing from veteran Rhode Island reporters, focused on the things that matter most in the Ocean State. Enter Email Sign Up
Q: Lawyers Defending American Democracy was only founded in 2018. Tell us about why you wanted to join the board.
Sheridan: I have followed the work of LDAD since its inception and have been impressed with the number of issues and initiatives it has pursued, as well as the high quality of its work – most of which was completed by volunteer Board members. A friend on the Board asked me to undertake a research project identifying developments at the state level which contravene the rule of law or other fundamental principles of our democracy. Upon completion of the initial phase of that project, I was honored to be asked to join the board and become more engaged with its mission.
Q: The organization recently called on Justice Thomas to recuse himself from the case involving former president Trump, who argues that he is immune from prosecution for his role in overturning the 2020 election results. Why was it important to organize this petition?
Advertisement
Sheridan: The case for Justice Thomas’s recusal from this case rests squarely on his wife’s extensive and well-documented involvement in efforts to overturn the election results and obstruct certification of the electoral vote – efforts at the heart of the charges against Mr. Trump. His conflict is clear, and his failure to recuse, particularly in light of significant reporting over the past months revealing other questionable ethical practices, is an embarrassment to this Court. Even under the court’s new Code of Conduct – a far weaker version than the one applicable to the federal courts – recusal is warranted, yet his obligation is ignored.
Q: Speaking of the Supreme Court, where do you come down on proposals to expand the court?
Sheridan: LDAD has not yet taken a position on expanding the Supreme Court. Our focus to date has been on adherence to the rule of law and conflicts of interest. We are dismayed that the Code of Conduct finally adopted by this court is not only weaker than the code applicable to all other federal judges, it also does not include an enforcement mechanism. SCOTUS should be held to a higher, not a lower, standard than other federal courts. As public trust and confidence in this Court diminishes, it poses an alarming threat to the rule of law. LDAD will retain our focus on these concerns.

Q: You’ve been around a long time, and you’re both a respected attorney and an astute political observer. How concerned should Americans be about the state of our democracy?
Sheridan: Americans should be concerned – and vigilant. The efforts to overturn the 2020 election and thwart the peaceful transfer of power did not occur in isolation. Many states have enacted barriers to voter registration, access to the polls, and voting by mail. There is cause for hope, however. Public officials and lawyers who failed to fulfill their legal and ethical obligations are facing the justice system and the possible loss of their law license – the latter being a focus of LDAD’s ethics complaints. Many brave officials and the judicial system withstood pressure, threats, and intimidation, as they adhered to the rule of law. LDAD will continue to play whatever role it can to defend our constitutional system.

R. Kelly’s 20-Year Child Porn Sentence Upheld,"Topline
A federal appeals court in Chicago upheld a 20-year sentence for disgraced singer R. Kelly on child pornography and enticement charges, rejecting his appeal just over a year after the former singer was sentenced—and he faces a separate 30-year sentence from another case in New York.

Key Facts
Attorneys for Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, had appealed his 20-year sentence in February, arguing the charges at hand fell outside the statute of limitations. In a ruling on Friday, however, a three-judge panel at the Chicago-based federal appeals court argued the “statute says otherwise, so we affirm his conviction”—the statute of limitations for sex crimes against children allows prosecution for the rest of the victims’ lives. Kelly, 57, was sentenced last February following a conviction on six counts of child pornography and enticement for allegedly forcing minors into sex—he had previously been acquitted on seven counts in the case of receiving child pornography. Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, told Forbes: “We are disappointed in the ruling but our fight is far from over,” hinting at an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Tangent
The three-time Grammy Award-winning singer’s legal troubles don’t end in Chicago. He was also sentenced to 30 years in prison in June 2022 following a high-profile 2021 New York conviction on eight counts, including racketeering and violating the Mann Act by trafficking women across state lines. Kelly could still see the light of day at the end of his sentence: A judge in Chicago ruled last year that 19 years of his 20-year sentence in Chicago can be served concurrently with his 30-year sentence, meaning the 57-year-old former singer faces a total of 31 years behind bars.
Crucial Quote
“By employing a complex scheme to keep victims quiet, [Kelly] long evaded consequences,” federal Judge Amy St. Eve wrote in the ruling, arguing that “those crimes caught up with him at last.”
Key Background
While Kelly repeatedly topped the charts in the 1990s and early 2000s with hits like “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Bump n’ Grind,” the R&B star’s career has been mired in controversy, with allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse circling him for nearly three decades. In addition to allegations of child pornography and trafficking, Kelly also raised eyebrows in 1994 when he married late singer Aaliyah when he was 24 and she was only 15. Two years later, Kelly’s ex-wife Tiffany Hawkins filed a lawsuit claiming Kelly had sex with her when she was a minor—Kelly settled that case for $250,000. In 2002, he was charged with 21 counts of child pornography—he pleaded not guilty and was later acquitted. His trial in Chicago stemmed from allegations made by five victims who said they were abused by Kelly while they were minors in the 1990s, while in his trial in New York, Kelly heard from 45 witnesses, including 11 who said he sexually or physically abused them (Kelly pleaded not guilty to all charges).

GOP rep on effort to oust Speaker Johnson: ‘I don’t know who would want the job at this point’,"Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) on Wednesday lambasted any Republican looking to oust House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), arguing the Louisiana Republican is doing the job “very admirably” given the circumstances.
“I’m standing with the Speaker because I actually consider him a friend, and I think he is trying to do the toughest job in politics. And I think given all the circumstances, he’s doing it very admirably,” Armstrong said during an interview with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell.
“My recommendation to any of my colleagues that are thinking about doing this — go back to October where we have 13 weeks where we go through all of this,” he continued. “Now, we’re walking into an election cycle. We have tremendous things that we can campaign on across our districts and by throwing ourselves into chaos without having any kind of real succession plan … I mean just to be honest, I don’t know how would want the job if this succeeds at this point.”
Johnson is facing the threat of being ousted from his role in the wake of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) motion to vacate the Speakership. Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.) emerged on Tuesday as the first Republican to publicly back the motion, citing Johnson’s plan to put Ukraine aid on the floor, along with his handling of government funding and the reauthorization of the U.S.’s warrantless surveillance authority.
Armstrong joins a series of lawmakers who have warned against moving forward with the motion to vacate. It comes just months after former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) was booted from the top role in the chamber over his handling of government funding and other policy disagreements.
“I do not support removing Mike as Speaker,” Armstrong said. “Again, I had the opportunity to come into Congress and serve with Mike. I think he has an incredibly tough job, and he’s doing it well.”
Infighting within the GOP conference caused the House to go without a permanent Speaker for nearly three weeks.
Johnson said he will not resign, calling the ouster effort “absurd” and “not helpful.”",2024-04-17T22:51:08Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
Boosie Badazz Defends R. Kelly While Putting Aoki Lee Simmons' Former Fling On Blast,"Boosie Badazz is someone who has always spoken his mind, regardless of whom his opinion might offend. Overall, this has led to some pretty heinous opinions over the years. For instance, he has offered numerous defenses of R. Kelly and Bill Cosby. In his mind, these are iconic and talented black men who are being disparaged. Considering the allegations against these two, such a take isn't exactly well received by the masses. However, he doesn't mind ruffling a few feathers, no matter what the consequences will be.
Recently, Boosie found himself upset about the situation with Russell Simmons' daughter, Aoki Lee Simmons. As we reported, Simmons recently broke up with her recently fling, who was in his 60s. It was a huge age gap, and some felt like it was very weird. Boosie was one such person, as he took to Instagram Live and went off on the double standards involving white men. As he explains, no one is talking about Aoki's former boyfriend, however, people were extremely quick to go after R. Kelly.

There is a key distinction here that ultimately negates the point Boosie is making. Of course, this is the fact that Aoki Lee Simmons is of age. Meanwhile, R. Kelly was having sex with minors. This is a huge distinction, and it is ultimately why people wanted to bring down R. Kelly. Either way, Boosie had a point that he wanted to make, and he made it. Whether or not it is a valid one, is up to his fans to decide.

"First picture of man, 25, caught with loaded gun in Tallaght feud as he faces sentence in two weeks","IN COURT First picture of man, 25, caught with loaded gun in Tallaght feud as he faces sentence in two weeks
THIS is the first picture of the young man who was caught with a loaded handgun as part of an ongoing feud in Tallaght.
Ryan Kelly, 25, from Captains Road in Crumlin, will be sentenced in the Special Criminal Court in two weeks for possessing a .39 Smith and Wesson gun with five rounds of ammunition on November 21, 2021.
1 Ryan Kelly will be sentenced later this month
The Irish Sun can reveal investigators from the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau believe the weapon was going to be used by one faction in the ongoing Tallaght feud.
Kelly has expressed “deep remorse” for his involvement in the plot.
Although no one has been killed in the Tallaght feud, Gardai have investigated numerous incidents including arson attacks and assaults.
One source said: “Kelly is well known in Crumlin but also has strong links to Tallaght.
“This is the first time he has been involved in something as serious as firearms possession.
“It looks as if he got way in over his head.”
On the night he was arrested, he was travelling in a car with three other people, including two who had keys to stolen cars.
Gardai also recovered gloves and “burner” phones.
One of the stolen cars had false number plates and a bottle of petrol in the passenger seat, while the other was never found.
Before his arrest, he was under surveillance and was seen hiding the revolver in a hedge across the road from his home.
He was then seen placing the gun - wrapped in a blue cloth - in a taxi being driven by Anthony Walker, 53, who also pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm.
Walker was arrested when armed officers swooped close to the M50. Kelly was also arrested travelling on the same route.
Officers also recovered texts between the pair, with Walker texting Kelly to say: “Send me the no. I nearly there.”
Kelly also replied: “I’ll be there”.
Kelly - who was also a target for Gardai in Crumlin - will be sentenced at the Special Criminal Court in two weeks.",2024-04-08T17:16:42Z,https://www.thesun.ie,The Irish Sun
"P. Diddy, R. Kelly & Co. haben frappante Ähnlichkeiten","Die Anschuldigungen gegen P. Diddy erinnern an die Fälle von Jeffrey Epstein und R. Kelly. Doch wie kommt es dazu, dass prominente Männer zu Straftätern werden? Eine Psychiaterin ordnet ein.
Psychiaterin ordnet ein : P. Diddy, R. Kelly & Co. haben frappante Ähnlichkeiten
Darum gehts P. Diddy sieht sich diversen Anschuldigungen, darunter sexuelle Übergriffe und die Verwicklung in Sexhandel, ausgesetzt.
Der 54-Jährige weckt damit Erinnerungen an Jeffrey Epstein und R. Kelly.
Eine Psychiaterin gibt Einblick in die Persönlichkeit solcher Täter.
Seit Monaten häufen sich die Anschuldigungen gegen den Rapper P. Diddy (54). Die Polizei führte auf seinen Anwesen in Miami und Los Angeles sogar Razzien im Zusammenhang mit organisiertem Sexhandel durch. Der Rapper erinnert stark an Jeffrey Epstein und hat sogar seine «Ghislaine Maxwell»: Diddys Assistentin Kristina Khorram soll ihm Frauen besorgt haben.
Auch Erinnerungen an R. Kelly werden wach. Der Sänger wurde 2022 wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs von Minderjährigen und Sexhandels zu 30 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt. Wie kommt es dazu, dass prominente Männer zu Straftätern werden?
Dr. med. Tanya Kochuparackal, leitende Ärztin an den Universitären Psychiatrischen Kliniken Basel meint gegenüber 20 Minuten, dass es schwierig sei, ein übergreifendes Persönlichkeitsprofil dieser Männer zu bilden. «Jeder Fall ist individuell», so die Forensikerin.
Jedoch vereine sie ein ähnliches Umfeld, welches Machtmissbrauch begünstige. «Der Promistatus kann die Täter schützen, zum Beispiel, indem Menschen in ihrem direkten Umfeld mitbekommen, dass etwas nicht stimmt und trotzdem nichts unternehmen», so Kochuparackal.
Hast du die Fälle Epstein und R. Kelly mitverfolgt? Ja, ich finde solche Fälle spannend. Nur R. Kelly habe ich mitbekommen. Nur Jeffrey Epstein hat mich interessiert. Nein, diese Fälle sagen mir nichts.
Promis kommen häufiger und länger mit illegalen Aktivitäten davon
Promis befänden sich in einer Art Paralleluniversum. «In einer geschlossenen Gesellschaft greifen staatliche und soziale Kontrolle nicht auf dieselbe Art wie in der Mehrheitsgesellschaft. Das kann dazu führen, dass beispielsweise misogyne oder sexistische Einstellungen und Verhaltensweisen toleriert werden und Teil eines Lebensstils sind», meint die Expertin.
Sie kommen deshalb oft und lange mit ihren illegalen Aktivitäten davon. «Die Stars umgeben sich häufig mit Personen, die ihr Selbstbild stärken und ihren Taten keine Grenzen setzen.» Erst gesellschaftliche Bewegungen wie «MeToo» führten dazu, dass Täter vermehrt zur Verantwortung gezogen werden.
Welchen Einfluss hat die Persönlichkeit der Täter?
Die Fälle Epstein, P. Diddy und R. Kelly vereinen laut der Ärztin auch die vulnerablen Opfer: «Es handelt sich um junge Frauen, die möglicherweise sogar Fans der prominenten Männer sind oder selbst von einer Karriere im Showbusiness träumen.»
Nebst dem Umfeld haben auch individuelle Persönlichkeitszüge einen Einfluss auf die Täter. «Bei P. Diddy fällt auf, dass er in einem kriminellen und gewalttätigen Umfeld aufwuchs und sein Vater ermordet wurde, als er noch klein war», führt die Expertin aus. Er brach sein Studium ab und startete mit 24 Jahren im Hip-Hop-Business durch.
«Seine Freundschaft zum Rapper The Notorious B.I.G, der 1997 erschossen wurde, zeigt, dass er sich schon früh im Umfeld von organisierter Kriminalität bewegte. Gewalt, Gangs und illegale Aktivitäten waren normal für ihn.»
«In unserer Gesellschaft sind Männer häufiger als Frauen in Positionen, die Machtmissbrauch zulassen.» Dr. med. Tanya Kochuparackal
Epstein, Diddy und R. Kelly haben möglicherweise einen Charakterzug gemeinsam: «Die Täter brauchen ein gewisses Mass an Selbstbezogenheit. Sie setzen ihre eigenen Bedürfnisse über das Recht und die Gefühle anderer.» Dies habe narzisstische Züge. «Es gibt aber auch Täter, die bescheiden und nett auftreten. Gerade bei Stars stellt sich zudem die Frage, inwiefern der Narzissmus Vermarktung oder echt ist.»
Dr. med. Tanya Kochuparackal hat auch eine Erklärung, wieso die Täter meist männlich sind: «In unserer Gesellschaft sind Männer häufiger als Frauen in Positionen, die Machtmissbrauch zulassen. Die soziale Bedeutung von Dominanz und Sexualität ist bei Frauen zudem weniger gross.»
Je nachdem, ob das Umfeld oder die individuelle Persönlichkeit die Taten stärker beeinflusse, sei eine Therapie oder eine Resozialisierung erfolgreicher. «Bei der Resozialisierung holt man die Täter aus dem kriminellen Milieu raus. Bei der Therapie stehen Dinge wie die Entwicklung von Mitgefühl, Verantwortungsübernahme und die Antizipation von Gefahrensituationen im Vordergrund». Da sich die Persönlichkeit und das Umfeld meist in einer Wechselwirkung befänden, müsse man meist beide Dinge in Angriff nehmen.

"R. Kelly Slams Diddy Sex Trafficking Investigation From Prison: ""I Know What They Did""","Last week, Homeland Security raided two of Diddy's mansions as part of a federal sex trafficking investigation, leaving the public in awe. Since then, the Bad Boy Records founder has been subject to even more scrutiny than usual, as countless social media users and peers share their reactions online. Most recently, R. Kelly even shared his thoughts on the debacle during a chat with Wack 100 on Clubhouse. He was critical of the investigation and others' responses.
“The sh*t is cr*zy. Motherf*ckers out there laughing and making comedian jokes and doing all the other sh*t on the radio and everything else, but they a** could be next,” he explained. “That’s what’s so f*cked up about. They so st*pid they don’t even realize the moves that’s going on. I don’t believe none of this sh*t. You could tell me about Puffy, you could about anybody. You could tell me on the news, the weather, the sky is blue, I’m not gonna believe the sh*t. Cause I’m in it now, and I know what they did.”

For those who don't know, R. Kelly is currently in prison for crimes similar to those Diddy is accused of, including sex trafficking, lewd acts with a child, and more. R. Kelly isn't the only inmate to weigh in Diddy's allegations as of late, however. Another convicted felon, Suge Knight, also recently shared his take on the raids. ""It's a bad day for hip hop, for the culture, for Black people,"" he said. ""'Cause when one look bad, we all look bad... That's definitely nothing to cheer about. I'll tell you what Puffy, your life is in danger... You know they're gonna get you if they can.""
What do you think of Homeland Security raiding two of Diddy's mansions last week? Are you surprised it was reportedly part of a federal sex trafficking investigation? What about R. Kelly's reaction to the situation? Share your thoughts in the comments section down below, and keep an eye on HNHH for more updates.

THE BIG STORY: Kelly Clarkson Sues Her Ex-Husband
Kelly Clarkson’s ongoing legal battle with ex-husband Brandon Blackstock just got more complicated.
Trending on Billboard
Didn’t they finalize their divorce back in 2022? Sure, but that personal settlement didn’t resolve trickier business entanglements — namely, Clarkson’s relationship with Starstruck Entertainment, a management firm owned by Blackstock’s father that oversaw her career for years.
Shortly after Clarkson filed for divorce, Starstruck sued her for millions in allegedly unpaid fees, claiming it had “invested a great deal of time, money, energy and dedication” into her and had “developed Clarkson into a mega superstar.”
Clarkson responded by filing a complaint with California’s Labor Commissioner, resulting in a $2.6 million ruling last year that her ex-husband and Starstruck had violated California’s Talent Agencies Act (TAA) by serving not just as her personal managers, but as unlicensed talent agents who procured business deals.
With Blackstock currently appealing that November decision, Clarkson filed a new case in Los Angeles court this week — echoing her labor law complaint, but aiming to potentially go even further. To learn more, go read out entire story, which features the actual lawsuit Clarkson filed against Blackstock.

R. KELLY ABUSE CONVICTION APPEAL — An attorney for the disgraced singer urged a federal appeals court to overturn his sexual abuse convictions and 30-year prison sentence, warning that the case against Kelly had stretched federal racketeering laws “to the point of absurdity” and could potentially turn college fraternities into illegal conspiracies.
MURDER CONVICTION OVERTURNED — A London appeals court overturned the murder conviction of Vybz Kartel, the Jamaican dancehall star who has worked with Rihanna, Jay-Z and others. The appellate court ruled that the guilty verdict had been tainted by a “fatal” error by the trial judge: allowing the jury to proceed as normal despite news that one of the jurors had attempted to bribe others.
THE SCATMAN COMETH — The Black Eyed Peas and Daddy Yankee were hit with a copyright lawsuit over allegations that they illegally sampled from classic ’90s song “Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)” in their own 2022 song “Bailar Contigo.” The case claims the artists promised only to interpolate the song and not to outright sample it, but “simply lied” in order to “avoid paying a larger licensing fee.”
JIMMIE ALLEN ASSAULT CASE DROPPED — The country star’s former manager agreed to dismiss her lawsuit claiming he sexually assaulted her, ending the case less than a year after it was filed. In the same filing, Allen also agreed to drop his countersuit accusing the woman of defamation. The lawsuit will continue against Wide Open Music, where the Jane Doe plaintiff was employed, and its founder, Ash Bowers. Allen will also continue to face a second lawsuit that claims that the singer assaulted a woman in a Las Vegas hotel room and secretly recorded it.
NBA YOUNGBOY CASE PAUSED — A federal judge ruled that the criminal case against YoungBoy Never Broke Again over gun charges must be put on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court decides a closely-watched Second Amendment battle this spring, likely delaying a trial that had been scheduled to start in July. The looming SCOTUS ruling will address a federal ban on gun ownership for domestic abusers; YoungBoy is accused of violating a similar gun ban for previously convicted felons.
DRAKE WANTS OUT OF ASTROWORLD CASE — Attorneys for the rapper asked a Texas judge to dismiss him from the sprawling litigation over the 2021 disaster at Travis Scott‘s Astroworld festival, which left 10 dead and hundreds injured. Drake was named in the cases because he performed on stage with Scott during the show, but his lawyers say he had nothing to do with planning the event and can’t be sued for simply showing up for a brief guest appearance.
THANK U, NEXT — Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez finalized their divorce in Los Angeles family court, with the singer agreeing to pay her ex-husband $1.25 million, plus half the proceeds from the sale of their joint home and $25,000 of his attorneys’ fees; she will not pay him any ongoing alimony. The legal split was relatively easy, as the couple had signed a pre-nuptial agreement and had no children or other significant legal issues.",2024-03-19T16:01:50Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Singer R. Kelly seeks appeals court relief from 30-year prison term,"Some of the judges questioned whether the employees knew about Kelly’s illegal activities with teenage girls
R. Kelly’s lawyer told an appeals court Monday that all kinds of legitimate organizations — even college fraternities — could be deemed racketeering organizations under a law used to convict the R&B superstar at his Brooklyn trial of sexually abusing young fans, including children, for decades.
Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, seeking to reverse his 2021 convictions or to win him a new trial, tried to persuade three judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that prosecutors improperly used a racketeering statute written to shut down organized crime to go after the singer.

She said it wasn’t fair that prosecutors charged Kelly, 57, with leading a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) enterprise from 1994 to 2018 compromised of individuals who promoted his music and recruited women and girls to engage in illegal sexual activity and to produce child pornography.
“This was not a collection of people who had a purpose to recruit girls for sexual abuse or child pornography,” Bonjean said. “Whether they turned a blind eye, whether some of them suspected that some of these girls were underage, that’s a whole different matter.
“And once we get into that sort of territory, where we’re going to say that constitutes a RICO enterprise, well we have a lot of organizations — we have a lot of frat houses — we have all types of organizations that are now going to become RICO enterprises,” she said in support of the Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling songwriter.

The judges did not immediately rule, but they had plenty of questions for Bonjean and a prosecutor who defended the government’s handling of the case, which resulted in a 30-year prison sentence in June 2022.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Kayla Bensing said Kelly’s network of aides and employees were part of the singer’s “system in place that lured young people in to his orbit” before he “took over their lives.”

At trial, several women testified that they were ordered to sign nondisclosure forms and were subjected to threats and punishments such as violent spankings if they broke what one referred to as “Rob’s rules.”
Some of the judges questioned whether the employees knew about Kelly’s illegal activities with teenage girls.
“What evidence is there that staff who arranged these things knew that they were underage? asked Circuit Judge Denny Chin.

The prosecutor responded by citing numerous instances of testimony, including one in which a woman testified that she told a member of Kelly’s entourage that she was 16 when he asked her age. Others knew some girls were not yet 18 because they booked flights for them and the girls had to provide their birth dates, she noted.

“So this is all evidence that the jury was entitled to infer that Kelly’s inner circle knew what was going on. That he was recruiting and maintaining underage women for sexual activity,” Bensing said.
“Members of the enterprise heard Kelly beat his girlfriends, they knew that Kelly was isolating his victims and they helped him do it, including by enforcing his punishments such as watching over them while they were confined to a bus for prolonged periods of time,” she added.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly , is known for work including the 1996 hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and the cult classic “Trapped in the Closet,” a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.
He was adored by legions of fans and sold millions of albums, even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child pornography charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex.
Widespread outrage over Kelly’s sexual misconduct didn’t emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.”

R. Kelly appeals all charges in sex abuse conviction,"A lawyer for R. Kelly has struggled to convince a US appeals court to overturn the former R&B superstar’s sex trafficking conviction and 30-year prison sentence.
Kelly, 57, is appealing his September 2021 conviction by a Brooklyn, New York, jury on all nine charges he faced, including racketeering and eight counts of violating the Mann Act, which forbids transporting people across state lines for prostitution.
His lawyer Jennifer Bonjean told he 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals that federal prosecutors failed to prove that the singer led a racketeering scheme where he recruited underage girls for sex and then violated several victims.
Questions from the three-judge panel in Manhattan suggested that argument might be a tough sell.

“Didn’t the government prove that one of the purposes of this enterprise was to recruit girls so that Kelly could have illegal sexual activity?” Circuit Judge Denny Chin asked.
Bonjean said it did not do so by relying on evidence such as Kelly’s employees passing out the phone number backstage of the singer, perhaps best known for the 1996 Grammy-winning smash I Believe I Can Fly.
“There was no evidence that anyone went out there saying, ‘May I find out what your age is, are you underage, come back, we want to serve you up to Mr. Kelly.’”
Circuit Judge Richard Sullivan suggested that the ages of some accusers might have been have been obvious.
“The appearance of these girls would be evidence enough, wouldn’t it?” he asked Bonjean.
“Looking young does not mean you know someone is a minor,” Bonjean responded.
The panel’s questioning of federal prosecutor Kayla Bensing was less pointed, as she spent three uninterrupted minutes recounting testimony from some accusers.
Some of the government’s 45 witnesses also testified that Kelly and his associates imposed repressive conditions, such as requiring that victims call him “Daddy” and get permission to eat or use the bathroom.
“The jury was entitled to infer that Kelly and his inner circle knew what was going on,” Bensing said.
“He used the enterprise to make them feel like they were confined, and that they had no way out.”
Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is among the most prominent people convicted of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo movement.
His conviction and sentencing followed two decades of misconduct accusations, which he has repeatedly denied.
Other arguments in Kelly’s appeal included that jurors prejudged his guilt, his lawyer was ineffective and the jury was improperly “swamped” by evidence of other alleged bad acts.
Kelly was also convicted in September 2022 by a Chicago jury of child sex crimes and sentenced to 20 years in prison.
But the judge there added just one year to Kelly’s imprisonment, with the other 19 years overlapping the original 30-year sentence.
Kelly has been behind bars July 2019, now at the Butner, North Carolina prison that housed late Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff. He will be 78 when eligible for release in 2045.",2024-03-18T21:29:05Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow

Schon seit den 90er Jahren gab es aber Anschuldigungen wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs gegen ihn. (dpa)",2024-03-18T18:12:21Z,https://www.express.de,EXPRESS
Attorney Wants RICO Verdict Overturned,"R. Kelly’s attorney on Monday (Mar. 18) urged a federal appeals court to overturn the singer’s sexual abuse convictions, warning that the case against Kelly stretched federal racketeering laws “to the point of absurdity” and could potentially turn college fraternities into illegal conspiracies.
At a hearing before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, lawyer Jennifer Bonjean told a panel of judges that Kelly’s employees had just been “unwitting” staffers performing “anodyne” tasks for a famous person, not a group with a criminal “purpose” like the Mafia or a drug cartel.
Seeking to reverse Kelly’s conviction under the federal RICO law (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act), Bonjean accused prosecutors of using that law in a “preposterous” new way.
Trending on Billboard
“The government has extended the RICO statute to a set of circumstances that is so beyond what the framers intended, which was to get at organized crime,” Bonjean said. “Now, we’re talking about an organization with an alleged criminal, but not organized crime.”
After decades of accusations of sexual misconduct, Kelly was convicted in September 2021 on nine RICO counts related to accusations that the singer had orchestrated a long-running scheme to recruit and abuse women and underage girls. In 2022, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
At Monday’s hearing, Bonjean repeatedly told the judges that the government had failed to prove that members of Kelly’s organization knew crimes were being committed, meaning the RICO law didn’t apply. She said, for instance, that staffers didn’t know any of the women were underage.
But Assistant U.S. Attorney Kayla Crews Bensing, arguing back for the government, sharply rejected that claim: “The defendant had a system in place that lured young people into his orbit and then took over their lives,” she told the judges.
Bensing pointed to specific evidence that members of Kelly’s organization had been aware of the organization’s ill intent. She cited testimony that one victim had been approached by a member of Kelly’s entourage at a McDonalds, that she told him that she was only 16 years old and that he had then given her Kelly’s number and told her to call him. Another Kelly employee testified that he had answered phones for “Kelly’s girlfriends,” Bensing said, some of whom he identified as “mid-aged teenagers.”
“This is all evidence that the jury was entitled to infer that Kelly’s inner circle knew what was going on: that he was recruiting and maintaining underage women for sexual activity,” Bensing said.
Kelly faces long odds in his battle to topple his conviction, as federal appeals courts only overturn a small percentage of the convictions that are appealed each year. But Bonjean has had success in such cases in the past, most notably winning a 2021 ruling that overturned Bill Cosby’s 2018 sex assault conviction.
Following Monday’s arguments, the court will issue a ruling in the coming months.
Like in many appeals, large parts of Monday’s hearing were spent wrangling over in-the-weeds legal issues, like whether a single sexual act could fit the definition of “forced labor” under federal law, or whether Bonjean even had a procedurally proper way to fight her appeal since Kelly’s previous attorneys had failed to challenge the instructions given to the jury at trial.
On her main point about whether RICO requires an illicit “purpose,” Bonjean repeatedly faced pushback from the judges. The judges pointed out on multiple occasions that there is no written requirement that the law only be used against outright criminal organizations, and one judge specifically noted that labor unions had been repeatedly charged with violating RICO.
“RICO is looking at organizations, that are then used to commit criminal acts,” Judge Denny Chin said. “It doesn’t have to be a criminal organization. It could be a completely legitimate organization. But if it engages in racketeering activity, it violates RICO.”
But Bonjean remained adamant, arguing that the statute could not be brought to bear against an organization like Kelly’s, which she said merely had the purpose of promoting his musical career and personal brand.
“This was not a collection of people who had a purpose to recruit girls for sexual abuse,” Bonjean said. “Whether they turned a blind eye, whether some of them suspected that some of these girls were underage, that’s a whole different matter.”
“Once we get into that sort of territory, where we’re going say that that constitutes a RICO enterprise, we have a lot of organizations, we have a lot of frat houses, we have all types of organizations that are now going to become RICO enterprises,” Bonjean added.
Pushing the point further, Bonjean said that such an approach would have allowed federal prosecutors to charge infamous Ponzi scheme perpetraor Bernie Madoff with RICO violations rather than the slew of fraud charges he actually faced. At that point, Judge Richard J. Sullivan cut in.
“Well, he got 150 years,” Sullivan said. “I don’t think that it mattered.”",2024-03-18T17:45:32Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
R Kelly appeals to overturn 30-year sex crime sentence,"R Kelly has appealed to a New York court to overturn a 30-year racketeering sentence, served to him in 2022.
The R&B singer - whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly - was found guilty of racketeering and trafficking following a high-profile trial in New York in 2021.
It followed years of accusations throughout his career.
He was served an additional year in prison on charges relating to indecent images of children and child enticement in Chicago last year.
Kelly - who was not present at the appeal - alleges that prosecutors failed to prove their racketeering claim or that he violated several women.
He also says he was denied a fair trial because several jurors prejudged his guilt, his lawyer provided ineffective counsel, and the jury was ""swamped"" by excessive evidence of other alleged bad acts.
Kelly was defended in the appeal hearing by lawyer Jennifer Bonjean, who began by disputing the definition of a RICO enterprise (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) and whether there has to be anything inherently illegal about such an organisation.
Speaking about Kelly's team of staff, and whether they were aware of ""what happened behind closed doors,"" she said that while ""there were rules and things, [the staff] did these anodyne tasks that were perhaps a little unusual, but not that put them on notice that what was happening behind closed doors was illegal"".
When asked about staff's specific knowledge of the age of girls recruited to come and see Kelly backstage, Ms Bonjean said: ""I do not believe there was any evidence that the employee would book travel for someone who was in fact under the age of consent.""

Kelly's brief marriage to pop star Aaliyah
Representing the United States, assistant US attorney Kayla Bensing said Kelly ""had a system in place that lured young people into his orbit, and then he took over their lives"".
She went on to describe women aged 16 or 17 invited by members of Kelly's staff to come backstage, including one who she said was invited by Kelly's bouncers to come backstage at a concert in Miami.
She said that was ""three days after Kelly's marriage to Aaliyah, in which he bribed a county official in order to hide or alleviate the consequences of illegal sexual activity"".
She also spoke about a former runner to Kelly, who described his girlfriends as ""looking very young, specifically middle-aged teenagers"".
Ms Bensing also said there was evidence Kelly's team knew he had been infected with herpes while having unprotected sex with his victims.
Claims of forced labour
She finally bought the claim of forced labour into the case, describing Kelly as ""obtaining labour and services, here sex acts, through threats of serious harm or physical restraint against the victims"".
In her three-minute rebuttal of the argument, Ms Bonjean said the forced labour counts ""were premised on a single act,"" adding, ""so unless the court is prepared to say that a single act of oral sex, even if it's forced, frankly constitutes forced labour, that is just making federal law co-extensive with state law"".
She also said the government was taking the position that ""a RICO enterprise cannot not be rooted in criminality,"" which she described as ""unique"" and ""not supported"" by previous cases.
The judges will now consider the appeal, and will issue a written decision at a later date.
Under his current convictions, Kelly, who is 57, will not be eligible for release until he is 80 years old.
Kelly rose from poverty to become one of the world's biggest R&B stars. He became known for chart-topping hits including I Believe I Can Fly, Bump 'N' Grind and Ignition.

R. Kelly's New York trial took place over nearly two months in 2021,"Arguments attempting to have R. Kelly’s racketeering conviction thrown were as broad and complicated as the criminal scheme he was found guilty of running – a scheme that, his attorney said, doesn’t meet the definition of a criminal enterprise at all.
There may have been evidence that the disgraced R&B star committed wrongdoing “using the quote-unquote machinery of his organization,” attorney Jennifer Bonjean argued Monday before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York.
But there was not sufficient proof, she said, that the people working under Kelly “acted with common purpose to, quote, recruit women.”
“Just using unwitting individuals who perhaps even turned a blind eye or didn’t inquire further does not (make) a RICO enterprise exist,” she said.
Kelly, a Chicago native, was convicted in Brooklyn’s federal court on wide-ranging racketeering charges – commonly referred to as RICO charges – alleging he ran a decadeslong scheme leveraging his star power to systematically sexually abuse girls and women. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison and is currently serving his term in North Carolina, records show.
In response to Bonjean’s arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kayla Bensing said there was plenty of evidence Kelly’s underlings knew they were enabling his illegal activities.
Members of his crew facilitated the bribery that got 15-year-old singer Aaliyah a fake ID so she could marry Kelly, Bensing said. At least two of Kelly’s employees testified that the singer’s female guests looked very young, and one victim who was approached by a member of Kelly’s entourage at a Chicago McDonald’s told him she was 16, Bensing said.
“This is all evidence that the jury was entitled to infer that Kelly’s inner circle knew what was going on,” Bensing said.
Monday’s arguments went well beyond the scheduled time.
When Bensing said she had gone over her allotted 10 minutes, the judges let her argument continue, with one of them saying, “There are a lot of issues here.” They then started peppering her with questions about allegations that Kelly knowingly transmitted herpes to two people without their consent.
During her rebuttal, Bonjean said that by prosecutors’ logic, many otherwise legal organizations could be deemed criminal if there are individual acts of sexual misconduct within them. A whole organization should not be considered an illegal enterprise just because one of its members committed crimes, she said.
“We have a lot of organizations, we have a lot of frat houses, we have all kinds of organizations that are now going to become RICO enterprises,” Bonjean said.
When she mentioned convicted financier Bernie Madoff, however, one of the judges cut her off.
“Well (Madoff) got 150 years, so I don’t think that it mattered,” the judge said.
The appellate judges did not render a decision Monday.
Kelly’s New York trial took place over nearly two months in 2021 and involved some 50 live witnesses.
Jurors ultimately found Kelly guilty of 12 individual criminal acts involving the racketeering scheme, including sex with multiple underage girls as well as the 1994 ploy to bribe an Illinois official to get a phony ID for Aaliyah.
In sentencing Kelly to 30 years, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly said the singer “left in (his) wake a trail of broken lives.”
“Although sex is certainly a weapon you used, this crime is not about sex; it’s about violence and cruelty and control,” she said, addressing Kelly. “You had a system in place that lured young people in your orbit and took over their lives.”
While the trial took place in New York, much of the evidence centered around Chicago, and testimony featured mentions of the old Rock ‘n’ Roll McDonald’s as well as Kelly’s suburban mansion in Olympia Fields.
Kelly went on trial in Chicago’s federal court in 2022 and was convicted on child pornography charges for explicit videos he made of himself and his then 14-year-old goddaughter, “Jane.” Kelly was also found guilty of inappropriate sexual relations with Jane and two other teenage girls, “Pauline” and “Nia.” The jury acquitted Kelly on separate charges of conspiring to rig his prior Cook County child pornography trial.
All but one year of Kelly’s 20-year term for the Chicago convictions is to be served concurrently with his New York sentence. The 57-year-old singer is not slated for release until 2045.
Kelly’s appeal of the Chicago conviction is pending. In arguments last month before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Bonjean argued that some of his convictions should be thrown out on statute-of-limitations grounds, and that U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber did not have an appropriate basis for giving Kelly such a long sentence.

Kelly Rowland's Today show dressing room drama detailed in new report,"Kelly Rowland reportedly had a classic diva complaint about an inadequate dressing room, which led her to dramatically walk off NBC’s “Today” show last week, minutes before she was due to guest-host the morning show’s fourth hour with Hoda Kotb, a new report said.
Sources close to the situation told TMZ that the former “Destiny’s Child” singer arrived at NBC on Feb. 15, just before 8 a.m. She already was “in full glam,” but she and her team immediately complained about the condition of her assigned dressing room.
Sources said that “Today” staffers explained to Rowland and her team that their dressing rooms were notoriously “dumpy, glorified closets” — not luxury suites. Apparently, the R&B singer and her team became even more incensed when they were told they couldn’t use a dressing room upstairs because it was reserved for Jennifer Lopez, who had guest-hosted “Saturday Night Live” earlier this month. They also were not happy with other dressing-room options suggested by “Today” staffers.
Seven minutes to air time Rowland and her team announced, “We’re gonna leave.” And they left. Kotb had to scramble to find someone else to help host the fourth hour, as regular host Jenna Bush Hager was off. British singer Rita Ora happened to be available and was able to step in and host, confirming that she only had minutes to prepare, Page Six reported.
The TMZ report confirms another report last week from Page Six, which also described Rowland’s sudden departure “at the 11th hour” because her dressing room wasn’t “up to par.”
Page Six said that Rowland was supposed to appear on the show to promote her new Tyler Perry-produced Netflix movie, “Mea Culpa,” in which she stars and is also a producer.
Her abrupt exit left “Today” insiders perplexed because a source told Page Six, “She’s loved at ‘Today.'” They also said that she was going to be on the show for the full hour with Kotb, who is known as “the biggest hype woman on the planet.”
On Tuesday’s episode of “Today,” Kotb tried to downplay the drama surrounding Rowland’s departure by complimenting the singer, Page Six reported.
“I just want to say this: I have great love and admiration for Kelly Rowland. I adore her, and I want her to come back on our show, and I want her to host again,” Kotb said
Co-host Jenna Bush Hager agreed that the singer is “welcome anytime,” adding, “She’s the best.”
But Kotb more or less confirmed that Rowland was upset about her assigned dressing room by offering to share her own dressing room with her, should she deign to come back on their show.
“We’ll be in it together!” Kotb said, laughing.
While “Real Housewives of New York City” alum Bethenny Frankel blasted Rowland for her “diva expectations” on “Today,” another morning-show host, Sherri Shepherd, used the incident to poke fun at the long-running morning show, while promoting her own.
Rowland was a guest on Shepherd’s show this week, and Shepherd shared a video clip of her running to greet the singer in the dressing room assigned to her, TMZ reported. The video showed the very spacious and stylishly decorated dressing room provided to Rowland, as it to show it was a lot better than what “Today” gave her.",2024-02-21T23:48:04Z,https://www.mercurynews.com,The Mercury News

Kelly, Bill Cosby, Jesus & Diddy On ""Vultures""","Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign held their album listening party for Vultures last night (February 8) at Chicago's United Center... and of course, it didn't end up dropping. Who's really surprised was our first question, but as they previewed more and more tracks, more pressing matters emerged. Moreover, there was a particular track that caught many listeners' ears, and its title going around social media right now is ""Carnival."" In it, the Chicago rapper makes reference to various ""canceled"" individuals, particularly entertainers accused of sex crimes, and as usual, drops a comparison to Jesus Christ, for good measure. 'Cause, you know, it's Kanye.
""Anybody p***ed off, gotta make them drink the urine/ Now, I’m Ye Kelly, b***h/ Now I’m Bill Cosby, b***h/ Now I’m Puff Daddy rich,"" Kanye West raps on the previewed song. ""That’s ‘Me Too’ me rich/ First she say she suck my d**k/ Then, she say she ain’t suck my d**k/ She ’gon take it up the a** like a ventriloquist/ I mean, since Taylor Swift, since I had the Rollie on the wrist/ I’m the new Jesus, b***h, I turn water into Cris’.”

Furthermore, this is alluding to Kanye West's tendency to rope his personal life and circumstances into his music, whether specifically for his antisemitism or the backlash surrounding it, which is why he mentions movements like #MeToo. Whether or not you're a fan of this, it's hardly surprising or notable anymore given everything that's happened up to this point. Even though this song didn't drop officially, fans still have some new Ye material to chew on, for better or worse. He and Ty Dolla Sign dropped the ""Vultures"" music video, plus visuals for ""Talking / Once Again.""
Meanwhile, with another listening party in New York tonight (February 9), maybe this is when the album will actually drop. Until then, Vultures seems more like a fleeting idea, performance art concept, or just a dream that we're still living in.

Kinderen Peter R. de Vries tegenover verdachten in rechtszaal: 'Missen hem nog elke dag',"ANP Royce en Kelly de Vries in de rechtszaal
NOS Nieuws • vandaag, 16:22 Kinderen Peter R. de Vries tegenover verdachten in rechtszaal: 'Missen hem nog elke dag'
In het proces tegen de verdachten van de moord op Peter R. de Vries kwamen vandaag de nabestaanden aan het woord. Kelly en Royce de Vries kozen ervoor om geen nieuwe verklaring voor te lezen.
Anderhalf jaar geleden, toen de zaak voor de eerste keer inhoudelijk behandeld werd, maakten ze gebruik van hun spreekrecht. Vandaag werd in de rechtszaal een video-opname van die slachtofferverklaring vertoond.
""Het is ondoenlijk om het verhaal te herhalen. We hebben toen onze hart en ziel erin gestoken, onze gevoelens en verdriet getoond. De woorden hebben niet aan betekenis of kracht verloren"", zei Royce de Vries als inleiding. ""We missen onze vader, opa van onze kinderen en ons maatje nog iedere dag, en dat zal altijd zo blijven.""
In de ogen kijken
Royce zat samen met zijn zus en hun moeder voorin de rechtszaal. Ze draaiden zich om, zodat ze de verdachten recht in de ogen konden kijken. Zoon Royce sprak ze aan bij hun voornaam aan en zei: ""We spreken ook jullie toe. We kijken nu ook jullie aan."" Toen de zaak anderhalf jaar geleden werd behandeld, stonden alleen de vermeende schutter en zijn chauffeur terecht. Daar zijn nu zeven verdachten bij gekomen.
Kelly en Royce de Vries draaiden zich in de rechtszaal om en richtten zich tot de verdachten:
1:27 Kinderen van Peter R. de Vries spreken verdachten toe in rechtszaal
Ook Tahmina Akefi, de vriendin van Peter R. de Vries, sprak destijds in de rechtszaal. Zij was vandaag afwezig omdat het verloop van het proces en de confrontatie met de onverschillige verdachten te veel impact op haar heeft, aldus haar advocaat. Akefi's advocaat voerde namens haar het woord: ""De belangrijkste vraag blijft onbeantwoord, de vraag wie de opdracht gaf voor de moord"", zei hij. ""Echte rouwverwerking is daarom nu niet mogelijk.""
Nieuwe verdachten
De rechtszaak tegen de verdachten van de moord op Peter R. de Vries ging gisteren voor de tweede keer van start. In 2022 eiste het OM levenslang tegen verdachten Delano G. en Kamil E. Beiden ontkennen de moord te hebben gepleegd.
Vlak voor de uitspraak werd het vonnis uitgesteld, nadat er nieuwe getuigenverklaringen aan het dossier waren toegevoegd. Ook werden er nieuwe verdachten opgepakt. In het najaar van 2022 besloot de rechtbank zelfs dat het hele proces over moest. Dit omdat een van de rechters verhuisde naar het buitenland.
Een van de nieuwe verdachten die in dit proces voor de rechter staat is Krystian M. Hij zou de moord hebben georganiseerd en de uitvoerders hebben aangestuurd. Ook Erickson O. en Gerower M. staan terecht. Deze mannen staan bekend als 'de filmers' en zouden beelden van de moordaanslag hebben gemaakt en verspreid om de schok in de samenleving te vergroten.",2024-01-24T15:22:26Z,https://nos.nl,NOS
R. Kelly Claims Ignorance Over $10.5 Million Lawsuit Against Him For Shooting Threat,"R. Kelly's legal trouble continues to mount and mount, this time over a lawsuit that he allegedly was never aware of. Moreover, according to new court documents reportedly obtained by TMZ, he blasted a $10.5 million August judgement awarded against him to a group of women. The judge in this case oversaw the case of six females who sued the artist and his alleged former manager Donnell Russell for reportedly sabotaging and shutting down a New York City screening of the Surviving R. Kelly docu-series in December of 2018 by threatening a mass shooting. He supposedly expressed that, if he was aware of the suit in the first place, he would have defended himself.
As such, it seems like this $10.5 million sum is a default judgement based on R. Kelly's failure to respond, although that's just an assumption. Given his response, though, it would make sense that said outcome was what won the lawsuit for the six women in this case and time. Regardless, this also follows a pattern of legal pushback from the Chicago native against endeavors against him. For example, he sued Tasha K and various prison workers last year for allegedly leaking information about him.

Back to this specific judgement, though, R. Kelly reportedly expressed that he's simply overwhelmed by the many lawsuits and cases against him, which he can't handle from his North Carolina prison cell. Beyond the sheer quantity, another reason he cited is the many changes in his legal team as of late, which caused him to completely miss the lawsuit. In addition, the 57-year-old said he ""cannot read or understand words beyond that of a grade schooler,"" so he wouldn't have been able to understand the suit in the first place without solid legal counsel. As the final cherry atop the excuse sundae this time around, he claimed Russell was never his manager and that, if he tried to stop the Surviving screening without Kelly, he did it ""for his own reasons,"" not on his orders.
Meanwhile, we'll see if there are any reversals or double-downs in this case. The pop culture world continues to discuss this situation, whether it's for a morbid laugh or for a serious conversation on abuse of power. Surely, it's too big of a case for it to slow down anytime soon. For more news and the latest updates on R. Kelly, come back to HNHH.

The massive, 30-room Olympia Fields mansion that disgraced recording artist R. Kelly once owned was listed Wednesday for $3.499 million.
The six-bedroom, 21,182-square-foot mansion only has had celebrity owners. Kelly, currently imprisoned on a sentence of more than 30 years after being convicted twice in the past two years on a slew of child sexual abuse charges, constructed it in 1997. Kelly lost the mansion to foreclosure in 2013, and another musician, Rudolph Isley, founding member of the R&B soul group the Isley Brothers, and his wife, Elaine, paid $587,500 for the mansion later that year.

The Isleys then undertook a major renovation of the mansion. Now, with Rudolph Isley having passed away in October at age 84, his estate has decided to list the mansion.
“When Rudolph and Elaine Isley bought the house, it had fallen to ruin,” listing agent Alex Wolking of Keller Williams ONEChicago told Elite Street. “It was a foreclosure and sat vacant for three years. The basement had been flooded, and they remodeled it to include a 1950s-style diner. They put in a new kitchen, and resurfaced the sport court. They’ve done a ton of work to it.”

Kevarnie Queen: Teenage serial rapist dubbed 'Brixton R Kelly' jailed,"A teenager serial rapist dubbed the ""Brixton R Kelly"" has been jailed after a three-year campaign of sexual violence against six women.
Kevarnie Queen, 19, was convicted in August of 22 counts of rape committed between 2019 and 2022.
He was 15 when he carried out most of his offences, with all the complainants under the age of 18.
One said she ""lost her innocence, her voice, and her integrity"" due to Queen's actions, Inner London Crown Court heard.
Judge Usha Karu handed Queen an extended sentence of 16 years on Monday - including 12 years in custody and four years on extended licence.
He was spotted with tear tracks on his face as he left the dock.
The judge said the victims in the case ""have all been severely traumatised"" and ""given their youth, this is likely to be long-lasting"".
Queen has been likened on social media to US singer R Kelly, who was sentenced in February to more than 30 years in prison for using his fame to sexually abuse young fans.

The Crown Prosecution Service said Queen met all but one of the complainants through Snapchat, an instant messaging app, and ""flatter and groom them"" before arranging to meet.
The court was told Queen would call the women ""beautiful"" and invite them over before initiating sexual activity ""whether any of them consented or not""- often ignoring pleas for him to stop.
On one reported occasion, a woman told Queen he had just raped her, and he responded: ""No, that's not rape, don't tell this to anyone. That's not rape.""
A number of the women suffered from sexually transmitted infections, with the CPS saying he had ""no regard for his victims"".
He was arrested in 2020 and denied the rape charges, claiming the complainants were part of a hate campaign against him.
The women in the case had told of attempting suicide or having suicidal thoughts, being manipulated by the defendant, being unable to trust men and no longer believing in love, the court heard.

Referring to one of the women, the judge said: ""(She) speaks of your manipulative behaviour and how she 'lost' herself.
""She had confided in you about having been previously abused and you took advantage of her vulnerability.
""She suffers from flashbacks, her present relationship has been affected, she finds it difficult to trust others and has relived past trauma that she had tried to bury.""
Judge Karu told Queen: ""You are a confident young man and appear to continue to hold the same firm views in respect of sex, and entitlement to it, which you did at the time of offending.""
Queen was subjected to a sexual harm prevention order as well as indefinite notification requirements.",2023-12-18T14:47:00Z,https://news.sky.com,Sky News
Serial rapist dubbed 'Brixton R Kelly' jailed for campaign of rapes against schoolgirls,"The court heard Queen was formerly a promising footballer, but left the game after a ban, dropped out of school, and fell in with gangs. He had an interest in weapons which he boasted about on social media, the judge said. Five of his six rape victims were just 15-years-old, and one told the court she has attempted to kill herself seven times in the aftermath of being attacked by Queen. He was branded the “Brixton R Kelly” after his crimes came to light in 2022, as the court heard Queen used body-shaming, mind games, and emotional abuse to stop the girls going to police, the court heard.",2023-12-18T11:35:33Z,https://www.standard.co.uk,Evening Standard

Referring to the complainants, the judge said: “They have all been severely traumatised by the events. Given their youth this is likely to be long lasting.”
Expanding on the victim impact statements read out in court last week, the judge said complainants told of attempting suicide or having suicidal thoughts, being manipulated by Queen, being unable to trust men and no longer believing in love.

Referring to one of the women, the judge said: “(She) speaks of your manipulative behaviour and how she ‘lost’ herself.
“She had confided in you about having been previously abused and you took advantage of her vulnerability.
“She suffers from flashbacks, her present relationship has been affected, she finds it difficult to trust others and has relived past trauma that she had tried to bury.”
Judge Karu found Queen legally dangerous and said: “You are a confident young man and appear to continue to hold the same firm views in respect of sex, and entitlement to it, which you did at the time of offending.”

She subjected him to a Sexual Harm Prevention Order until further order as well as indefinite notification requirements.

The defendant was likened on social media to American R&B singer R Kelly, who was sentenced in February to 20 years in prison for child pornography and enticement of minors for sex.
Queen met all but one of the complainants through Snapchat where he would “flatter and groom them” before arranging to meet, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
The court heard on Monday that Queen would flirt, call the women “beautiful” and invite them to his home where he would initiate sexual activity “whether any of them consented or not”, often ignoring direct pleas for him to stop.
He also forced himself on some of the complainants in stairwells in blocks of flats.
On one occasion, a complainant told him that he had just raped her, to which Queen responded: “No, that’s not rape, don’t tell this to anyone, that’s not rape.”
Several of the women suffered from sexually transmitted infections.
The CPS described him as a “prolific sexual predator” who had “no regard for his victims”.
The court heard Queen had the “chance of training for professional football” and that “a likely promising future has been cut short” because of his own offending.
An author of a pre-sentence report stated that Queen has “entrenched beliefs regarding females and entitlement to sex” and described himself as being “a 100% player”.
Advertisement
The author of the report said: “He presented with limited awareness of consent and what it entails, whereby his sexual preoccupation and perceived wants and desires became predatory, and took precedence over the impact on the victims to achieve his expected outcome, which was sex and status.”
He was arrested in April 2020 and then again in June and August 2022 on suspicion of various counts of rape which he denied, claiming the women were all lying and were part of a hate campaign against him.
Following his conviction in August, Laura Devitt, senior crown prosecutor from the Rape and Serious Sexual Offences Unit in London South, commended the “immense bravery and mental fortitude” of the victims to come forward.
“Queen has clearly demonstrated he saw these young girls’ existence purely for his own satisfaction,” she said.
“Queen claimed he was a ‘player’ and knew how to make girls like him and that any activity was consensual.
“His misogynistic and deplorable actions have now been exposed for what they are, and these convictions ensure no further women are caused further irreparable harm at his hands.”",2023-12-18T00:00:00Z,https://www.breakingnews.ie,BreakingNews.ie
Kelly Clarkson vai receber indenização milionária do ex-marido,"Kelly Clarkson – Grosby Group
Vitória! Kelly Clarkson ganhou uma decisão legal contra seu ex-marido Brandon Blackstock. Ele deve mais de US$ 2,6 milhões em comissões que a artista pagou por conseguir negócios enquanto ele atuava como seu gerente.
Na decisão, tomada no último dia 21 de novembro, o comissário do trabalho da Califórnia decidiu que Blackstock conseguiu uma série de acordos para Clarkson, incluindo seu lucrativo papel como jurada no “The Voice”. Tal valor que deveria ter sido administrado por seus agentes de talentos na Creative Artists Agency (CAA).
A Comissária do Trabalho, Lilia Garcia-Brower, decidiu que Blackstock violou a Lei de Agências de Talentos (TAA) da Califórnia, que proíbe qualquer pessoa que não seja um agente de talentos licenciado de procurar trabalho para artistas.
Após um casamento de sete anos, Clarkson e Blackstock ficara casados por sete anos. Ele pediu o divórcio de em junho de 2020 e dois anos depois a cantora concordou em pagar ao ex-marido pensão alimentícia mensal de US$ 45.601 para seus dois filhos, mais uma quantia única.
Este foi o primeiro casamento de Kelly e o segundo de Brandon. Juntos eles têm dois filhos: River e Remington. Recentemente, o ex-casal colocou sua casa familiar de Los Angeles no mercado à venda por US$ 10 milhões (R$ 49 milhões).
Entenda a dívida
O ex de Kelly terá que pagar as comissões ganhas em quatro negócios: US$ 1.983.155,70 por garantir o papel de Clarkson no “The Voice”; US$ 208.125 para um acordo para promover a Norweigan Cruise Lines; US$ 450 mil para um acordo para promover a Wayfair; e US$ 93,30 para sediar o Billboard Music Awards em 2018, 2019 e 2020.
A alegação de Clarkson de que seu ex-marido também era obrigado a pagar as comissões que ganhou ajudando a garantir o “The Kelly Clarkson Show”, foi rejeitada.
Na decisão, destacou-se que o envolvimento do ex-gerente, nesse acordo, incluindo a “criação de estratégias” com os seus agentes, foi “a pedido da CAA” e, portanto, não uma violação da lei.
“Quando um gestor traça estratégias com o agente durante uma negociação e não aborda o potencial empregador sem a permissão do agente, ele está fazendo exatamente o que o TAA exige dele”, escreveu Garcia-Brower.",2023-12-01T17:14:00Z,https://www.ofuxico.com.br,OFuxico

R. Kelly Sues Prison Workers And Tasha K For Alleged Info Leaking Scheme,"R. Kelly is heading back to court, though this time its civil court rather than criminal. That's because according to TMZ he just filed a new lawsuit at what he alleges is a scheme used to leak his private information. Named in the suit is the U.S. Government, a handful of employees at a Chicago prison, and blogger Tasha K. The suit accuses the employees of taking documentation on what Kelly was doing through internal computers and communicating it to Tasha, who then published it on her blog.
R. Kelly has been making these claims since long before the lawsuit. But now he's officially taken legal action at the entire scope of the scheme. Consequently, he's calling out some of the videos Tasha posted for deliberately harming his reputation and causing him emotional distress. She's already answered for the allegations before they were elevated to a legal level. Tasha denies any wrongdoing or being part of any scheme. Check out her addressing the allegations below.

R. Kelly Accuses Tasha K Of Scheming To Violate His Privacy
For Tasha K, being sued by a major artist is nothing new. Cardi B famously took the blogger to court for defamation and won. Since the verdict Tasha and her lawyers have been hunting for any way to avoid paying Cardi the full payout she's owed. But the rapper's lawyers have been quick to fight back and seem ready to drag out the legal drama for as long as it takes.
R. Kelly news has been pretty slow in recent months. The most recent legal development for the singer came back in August. Additionally he's being ordered to pay $10.5 million to a group of victims after making threats to stop their screening of Surviving R. Kelly. What do you think of R. Kelly's newest lawsuit accusing multiple parties conspiring to violate his privacy? Let us know in the comment section below.

R. Kelly Sues Federal Prison Bureau Over Illegal Leaks To YouTube Host,"R. Kelly is suing the federal Bureau of Prisons over allegations that the agency leaked private information about the disgraced singer to social media personality Tasha K — the same YouTube gossip host that Cardi B sued for defamation last year.
Explore Explore R. Kelly See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news
In a complaint filed Monday (Nov. 13) in Chicago federal court, Kelly’s lawyers say an unnamed Bureau of Prisons (BOP) agent illegally accessed Kelly’s digital prison records — including recordings of private phone calls with his girlfriend and lawyers — and sold them to Tasha, who then broadcast them online to more than 1 million followers.
“The defendant United States of America breached its duty of care to the plaintiff when it allowed countless BOP officers to access plaintiff’s confidential information without any legal basis to do so,” Kelly’s lawyer Jennifer Bonjean writes.
The lawsuit, which also names Tasha K (Latasha Kebe) as a defendant, claims that the influencer then “rallied her massive following to harass the plaintiff with the use of the stolen information and created chaos in plaintiff’s personal life.”
The leaks left Kelly “isolated and fearful to communicate with his attorneys or other third parties,” the lawsuit claims, because he knew it could be “released to the general public for mass exploitation.”
Kelly was convicted in 2021 on racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from accusations that he orchestrated a long-running scheme to abuse women. In September 2022, he was convicted in Chicago on separate federal charges of child pornography and enticement of minors for sex. The singer, who is currently appealing both convictions, was later sentenced to 30 years in prison.
If Kebe’s name sounds familiar, it should. Last year, Cardi B won a $3.9 million defamation judgment against the blogger over false statements Kebe made about drug use, STDs and prostitution on her YouTube channel “UnWinewithTashaK.” Kebe has since filed for federal bankruptcy, citing her inability to pay that huge judgment.
In his new lawsuit, Kelly claims that Kebe first published private information in November 2019, starting with a video called “R. Kelly Can’t Control his Girlfriends while Behind Bars” that contained information Kebe said came from a “phone tap somewhere.” Later posts allegedly divulged more personal information, including highly-sensitive communications with his legal team.
“The communications … related to personal and family problems, romantic interests, health problems, literacy issues, and issues related to the defense of his pending criminal cases,” Kelly’s lawyers write.
According to the lawsuit, an internal BOP investigation revealed that an unnamed officer had pulled Kelly’s records from the agency’s TruView system, a digital database of information on prisoners. The officer then allegedly scanned them and “emailed that scan to third parties, including defendant Kebe.” But that probe ended without any action against the officer, Kelly’s lawyers claim.
“No charges were brought against defendant BOP Officer A, and the government has refused to reveal any details about the investigation including the identity of Officer A,” Bonjean wrote in Monday’s complaint. “In short, there has been a cover-up of the rampant BOP misconduct that is ongoing.”
Kelly’s lawyers claim that illegal leaks continued even after the BOP was made aware of the initial disclosures to Kebe. They cited a report last summer by the Washington Post about Kelly’s $25,000 in commissary funds — a report that resulted in federal prosecutors seizing the money to pay off his victims.
In technical legal terms, Kelly’s lawyers allege that the leaks amounted to negligence, an invasion of his privacy, an intentional infliction of emotional distress, civil theft and civil conspiracy. They also claim that the officer who stole the records violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act — a federal statute that makes computer hacking illegal.
A spokesperson for the BOP declined to comment, citing agency policy on pending litigation. An attorney who has represented Tasha K on other matters did not immediately return a request for comment.",2023-11-13T19:14:52Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

Currently, he's navigating the terrain of probation, and his tales from behind bars have become legendary. They've been featured as hilarious segments on his popular podcast.
However, Gillie Da Kid, a Philly rap figure who's no stranger to the industry, and part of the Major Figgas group with Wallo, recently took to social media for some playful fun at his cousin's expense. Gillie da King is playfully poking fun at his cousin Wallo for his extensive prison term. Gillie humorously captioned an Instagram post featuring R. Kelly singing ""Bump and Grind,"" suggesting that Wallo's prison talent show wins might not have continued if R. Kelly were his competition. Regardless of how entertaining Wallo's performances were.

Gold Bar Bob set cops on rival,"Bob Menendez’s wife partied with Mob Wives and Real Housewives, then two-timed her attorney boyfriend to become the senator’s lover, The Post can reveal.
And during their tumultuous courtship, the New Jersey Democrat sent Capitol Police officers to his love rival’s office to “bully him out of the picture,” a friend of the attorney — who represented R. Kelly during his sex-trafficking trial — told The Post.
Nadine Arslanian Menendez is facing up to 45 years in prison, accused of conspiring with her husband to commit fraud, bribery and extortion by selling the power of his office to the Egyptian government and three businessmen in exchange for a convertible Mercedes, gold bars and cash he stashed in his jackets.
She and Menendez pleaded not guilty in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday, with Arslanian bringing a $2,300 quilted Chanel bag for their first joint court appearance.
“I’m just heartsick about her,” said a woman who identified herself as a close relative. “I’ve been crying all day. She is an upstanding person. Nothing in her life prepared her for this.”

Marriage to a senator should have been the culmination of an American dream for Arslanian, who was born in 1967 in Beirut, Lebanon, in a wealthy Armenian household.
She and sister Katia each had their own governess, a family friend told The Post.
But when the country descended into civil war in 1975, the family fled first to Greece and then to London and Palo Alto, Calif., then settled on a leafy suburban street in Nassau County, where her parents, Garbis and Ida Tabourian, were staunch supporters of the Armenian community.

Arslanian attended New York University, graduating with undergraduate and master’s degrees in international politics and French history, then married New Jersey developer Raffi Arslanian and had two children.
They bought a modest home in Englewood Cliffs, with plans to tear it down.
“They wanted to build their dream home, but the whole thing fell apart,” attorney Douglas Anton told The Post.
He started dating Arslanian in 2011 and did some legal work for her.
He also represented R. Kelly at the trial that ended with the star’s conviction for sex-trafficking.
Kelly was jailed for 30 years.
25 In March 2018, Menendez was photographed with his new girlfriend, Arslanian, and Egyptian American businessman Wael “Will” Hana. But she was also dating attorney Doug Norton at the time. New York Post
25 Nadine Arslanian was dating lawyer Doug Anton at the same time that she started dating Menendez, Anton said. They had a night out in May 2018, months after Anton told The Post that Menendez revealed his love for her. New York Post
After the couple divorced in 2005, Arslanian struggled to raise daughter Sabine and son Andre.
The children studied at the elite Lycée Français in Manhattan, where tuition tops $46,000 a year — and she would take them to a Union City IHOP on the commute.
Follow The Post’s live blog for the latest updates in the Menendez indictment.
That was how she met Menendez, at the IHOP in 2008 — not December 2018, as he claimed in an interview with the New York Times in 2021 — said Anton.
The owner of the restaurant introduced her to the senator, he said.
“They maintained a friendship,” said Anton. “She used to call him every year on his birthday. Sometimes he invited her for lunch if he was doing an event in New Jersey and she would go with one of her girlfriends.”

A decade-long friendship is the opposite of the account Arslanian and Menendez gave to the Times’ “Vows” column in which she claimed that they met in December 2018 and she had no idea who he was.
“We were introduced by the owner of the IHOP, and I didn’t know at that time that Bob was a senator,” Arslanian said in 2021. “He was very intelligent and had a great sense of humor, and he was very, very hot.”
While keeping up a friendship with Menendez, Arslanian enjoyed partying with the stars of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey,” including Jacqueline Laurita, at venues including Kim “Kim D.” DePaola’s boutique Posche in Allendale, NJ.
25 Another party night was with Brittany Fogarty â daughter of convicted mobster John Fogarty â and her mom, Andrea Giovino, both stars of “Mob Wives.” Nadine Arslanian/Facebook

She also socialized with “Mob Wives” stars Karen Gravano (daughter of Salvatore “Sammy the Bull” Gravano) and Brittany Fogarty — daughter of convicted mobster John Fogarty — and her mom, Andrea Giovino, once nicknamed the “real-life Carmela Soprano.”
And she hung out with “Iron Chef” star Marc Forgione at the now-closed Englewood Cliffs branch of his American Cut steakhouses and enjoyed nights out at upscale Manhattan restaurant Boulud Sud.
Another friend was former Gambino family enforcer-turned-celebrity author John Alite, who testified against mobster John Gotti in 2008 and has written several books about his time in the underworld.
“She’s a goodhearted woman, but she was having a hard time financially,” Alite told The Post Wednesday. “We were friends. She used to help me pick out gifts for my girlfriends.”
25 Love rival Doug Norton, who sang Bon Jovi’s “Always” with Arslanian on Christmas Eve 2017, tells The Post that she started dating both him and Menendez soon after, and that police became involved. New York Post
Financially pressed, Arslanian moved daughter Sabine and son Andre from the Lycée to public schools closer to the family’s home.
“It was a great little family, really tight-knit,” said Michael Mathews, who used to date Sabine, whom he met when they both attended Cresskill High School. “Nadine was a sweetheart and a very caring mother who did everything she could for her kids, even though she barely had enough to get by.”
Mathews, who used to work as a paralegal in Anton’s New Jersey law office, said he sometimes helped out by picking up Arslanian’s kids from school.
“Sometimes she only had $20, and gave it to me for gas so that I could pick them up, ” he said. “She had a horrible financial situation and had to do odd jobs. She sometimes helped a friend who was a hairstylist.”

Despite her financial troubles, she kept up her relationship with Anton, and on Christmas Eve in 2017, the couple lovingly sang Bon Jovi’s “Always” together.
But a few days later, on January 1, 2018, she picked up the phone to wish her friend Sen. Menendez a happy 64th birthday — and her life changed.
Menendez was fresh from his bribery trial ending in a hung jury, and at the time was expecting to be retried.
The Department of Justice dropped the charges after the Supreme Court narrowed the definition of bribing a public official.

Menendez asked if she was still dating “that Doug lawyer,” and told her that he had been in love with her since 2008, said Anton.
For the next several months, Arslanian dated both men “on and off,” Anton told The Post, adding that the situation was fraught with tension and jealousy.
At one point, in May 2018, Menendez dispatched two Capitol Police officers to Anton’s office in Hackensack, Anton said. “As soon as they left, I had my security team sweep the building,” he said.
A friend added: “He wanted to bully Doug out of the picture.”

A spokesperson for Capitol Police refused to comment Thursday, and Anton told The Post that nothing ever came of the visit from the police.
Arslanian was broke and facing foreclosure on her Bergen County home at the time, but she had a weakness for designer outfits and a taste for the high life.
Prosecutors said she was unemployed.
“She was in this fancy Cinderella role when she started dating Menendez,” a friend said.
What we know about Bob Menendez's indictment New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez is facing federal corruption charges related to an alleged years-long scheme. Menendez allegedly accepted bribes, including gold bars, in exchange for helping three businessmen, Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes, and the country of Egypt, according to officials. Menendez and his wife, Nadine, were charged with taking hundreds of thousands in bribes, according to a Manhattan federal indictment. When the feds raided Menendez’s Englewood Cliffs home in June 2022, they found a 2019 Mercedes C-Class, at least 13 gold bars, and $566,000 in cash “stuffed in envelopes.” Another $70,000 in cash was found in Nadine’s safe deposit box. 25 Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and his wife, Nadine Menendez, were indicted on federal corruption charges. AP The feds say Menendez also received mortgage payments and paid for a low-show or no-show job and home furnishings. This isn’t the first time the 69-year-old Democrat is facing federal corruption charges. In 2015, Menendez was accused of taking gifts from Florida eye surgeon Salomon Melgen. The “gifts” included a Paris vacation, flights on a private jet, and vacations at Melgen’s villa in the Dominican Republic.
Arslanian appears to have been drawn to Menendez’s power and access to the high life.
During their romance, Menendez invited the statuesque blonde to high-level meetings with dignitaries, and even offered to help her with a job, friends told The Post.
Although friends warned Arslanian against dating the senator, she seemed giddy with excitement, they said.

“He sold her a dream,” said Alite. “I told her, ‘Nadine, this guy’s … not for you.’ He really manipulated her. She thought she was going to marry Doug, but Menendez wooed her away. He manipulated her; he made her feel important. He was promising her the world.”
For Arslanian, who was facing foreclosure on her Englewood Cliffs property, the prospect of being the senator’s girlfriend seemed too good to be true.
Soon she started traveling with Menendez on trips to Puerto Rico, Turks and Caicos, as well as Colombia and Greece.
“She did like high-end things,” said Mathews. “She cared about materialistic things, and in many ways was a very gullible person, especially if someone had money and power.”

Menendez wooed her in other ways.
He worked hard to convince the US Senate to adopt a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide — an issue that was of paramount importance to her family, especially her father, now 93.
Arslanian told the Armenian Report podcast that 13 “immediate members” of her family were killed in the 1915 genocide.
“It’s very hard when I think about what they went through,” Arslanian said. “My paternal grandfather’s dream was to have the world recognize what we went through.”

On Dec. 12, 2019, Menendez announced that the resolution had passed the Senate and choked up when he made the televised announcement.
He texted Arslanian, by then his fiancée, that afternoon: “Truth, perseverance and a commitment to a cause greater than yourself, in honor of your family, and all who suffered, I hope your father was watching,” read the text that Arslanian shared on the podcast. He added “Never Forget” in Armenian script.
“He is very, very caring, almost to a fault,” Arslanian said about Menendez on the podcast. “Whatever he does, I support him.”
Menendez proposed to Arslanian in front of the Taj Mahal on an official trip to India in 2019.

He sang “Never Enough” from “The Greatest Showman” before presenting her with a ring.
The couple married in an Armenian church in Bayside, Queens, in October 2020.
In an interview with the New York Times’ “Vows” column, he claimed they had only met in December 2019, long after photographs show them together.
Now friends fear that the senator may throw his wife under the bus to save his career.

“She’s a victim,” said Alite. “Trust me 110 percent, this guy manipulated the s–t out of her. He used her and manipulated her. As a senator, he’s a half-a–ed gangster.”

Tinashe says music label forced her to record single with R. Kelly,"Tinashe is being more candid than ever about her artistic evolution and her controversial collaborations during her time with RCA, the label she left in 2019.
In a new interview with the Zach Sang Show, Tinashe was asked whether she thought her singles with disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly and Chris Brown — who has long been criticized for assaulting Rihanna in 2009 and has also been accused of numerous other violent crimes since then — were a result of her label’s faulty strategy to launch her career. At the time of their release, the singles resulted in immense scrutiny pointed at Tinashe for working with men who had a history of violence against women.
Before speaking up, Tinashe appeared stunned and responded with a laugh: “You think I wanted [to do those songs]? I literally block out that R. Kelly song from my mind — I forget that it even exists,” she said. “That is so embarrassing. That is so unreal that I even have a song with R. Kelly.”
The singer-songwriter shared her seventh full-length studio effort, a 7-song collection of R&B-leaning pop titled “BB/ANG3L,” on Sept. 8 via Ricky Reed’s Nice Life Records (which also houses Lizzo), but has long been vocal about her distaste for major labels after struggling under RCA as an up-and-coming artist.
She told Sang, “I was so young too, which is crazy because I feel like I did that song when I just signed to that label… I was probably like 20.” Sang then brought up the backlash Tinashe received as a result of the collaborations, saying the “public perceives it as you doing willingly,” and acknowledged the fact that Tinashe had a “lack a lot of control.”
“Especially when it comes to singles,” Tinashe continued. “Like for example that song with with Chris, that was a song that… we all wanted it to be this big moment — this big single. So I feel like in [the label’s] mind, they were like ‘You need the support.’ And [Chris] was like their biggest artist that they had on rhythmic radio at the time.”
Brown appeared as a featured artist on Tinashe’s 2015 single “Player,” although the song failed to make much movement on the charts. “I was like, ‘Well, this is a pop song so I really don’t feel like we should put Chris on it like that. I don’t like that. That doesn’t compute to me.’”

"Kelly Dixon Chambers: Staff director, House Rules Committee Republicans","Kelly Dixon Chambers brings 25 years of Capitol Hill experience to heading up the staff at the House Rules Committee, from walking into Rep. Kevin Calvert’s (R-Calif.) office to ask for a job up through working floor operations and then legislative operations for Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) when he was the Republican whip and majority leader.
Her strengths lie in a combination of expertise in floor procedure and policy — being able to not only understand the technical procedures required to achieve certain legislative outcomes, but also being able to marry that to the policy and political priorities when speaking with members.
As staff director for the House Rules Committee under Chairman Tom Cole (R-Okla.) — the last stop for legislation before the House floor — Dixon Chambers brings deep institutional knowledge about how the House has operated.
“It’s an ever-evolving place,” she said of Capitol Hill.
She noted, for example, House Rules Committee hearings that can stretch into the wee hours of the morning used to be much worse, with meetings in previous years starting just before midnight.
Through it all, it is the wonder of the Capitol — and being part of it — that has kept Dixon Chambers on the Hill for more than two decades. She recalled a tough day on the House floor in 2011 after the rise of the Tea Party, when a member asked her: “How do you do this?”
“I remember sort of looking around the chamber and being like, ‘The worst day I ever had is still here,’” she said.",2023-09-12T10:00:00Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
Former Georgia senator on indictment recommendation: ‘I make no apologies for serving my state’,"Former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) spoke out on Friday following revelations that a Fulton County, Ga., grand jury recommended charges against her, saying she will “make no apologies” for speaking on behalf of former President Trump.
Instead, similarly to Trump, she painted the case as a political attack.
“Trying to jail your party’s leading political opponent ahead of 2024 is election interference,” Loeffler wrote in a statement shared on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Speaking out in defense of election integrity is not.”
“I make no apologies for serving my state by giving voice to millions of Americans who felt disenfranchised in 2020 — and I refuse to be intimidated by a two-tiered system of justice that seeks to systematically destroy conservatives across the country,” she added.
Her comments come after a grand jury report in the case, which has resulted in the indictments of Trump and 18 others over their alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election in the state, was released in full on Friday. Trump made an effort to block the report from being released, but was unsuccessful.
While only 19 people were arraigned in the Georgia election case, charges were recommended for larger group — nearly 40 — of Trump’s allies. The list included three current or former U.S. senators: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Loeffler.
Jurors voted 14-6 to recommend an indictment against Loeffler, but ultimately she was not charged.
The report states that one member of the jury decided against charging Loeffler and Purdue because their statements, “while pandering to their political base, do not give rise to their being guilty of a criminal conspiracy.”
Trump slammed the release of the report, claiming it has “zero credibility.”
“The Georgia Grand Jury report has just been released. It has ZERO credibility and badly taints Fani Willis and this whole political Witch Hunt,”Trump posted on Truth Social. “Essentially, they wanted to indict anybody who happened to be breathing at the time.”",2023-09-08T22:38:24Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
Juiz ordena R. Kelly indenizar vítimas de abuso sexual,"R. Kelly / Reprodução TV / YouTube
As vítimas de R. Kelly, que está cumprindo 30 anos de prisão por suas condenações por extorsão e tráfico sexual desde 2021 em Nova York, receberão o dinheiro dos royalties musicais do cantor, detidos pela Universal Music Group. A juíza distrital dos Estados Unidos, Ann Donnelly, decidiu que o artista terá que abrir mão de US$ 520.549 (R$ 2,5 milhões) de sua editora musical para cobrir os custos de restituições não pagas e multas.
De acordo com o jornal “The New York Post”, a Universal tem 10 dias para entregar o dinheiro.
Os royalties da Sony, de mais de US$ 1,5 milhão estão sendo solicitados por uma vítima de pornografia infantil em Chicago, que recebeu US$ 4 milhões, já que Kelly ainda lhe deve US$ 42 mil em multas e restituições.
No entanto, a Sony Music não terá que entregar mais dinheiro desta vez, já que os royalties da Universal são suficientes para pagar o restante das multas, segundo a publicação.
R. Kelly foi considerado culpado de todas as nove acusações contra ele, incluindo extorsão e violações da Lei Mann, que proíbe o transporte de “qualquer mulher ou menina” através das fronteiras estaduais para qualquer “finalidade imoral”.
O cantor negou todas as acusações que enfrentou. O juiz que cuidou do caso disse que ele mostrou “indiferença ao sofrimento humano” e forçou suas vítimas à “obediência” e aos “horrores”.
Durante o julgamento de pornografia em Chicago, o júri viu segmentos de vídeos de Kelly abusando sexualmente de uma menor de idade, que era afilhada do cantor. A menina, identificada apenas como ‘Jane’ durante o julgamento, disse que Kelly começou a abusar sexualmente dela quando ela tinha apenas 14 anos e, quando completou 15, disse ao júri que eles começaram a ter relações sexuais “inúmeras vezes”, acrescentando que os casos foram “incontáveis”.
Jane disse em um comunicado: “Nunca vou recuperar o que perdi para Robert Kelly… Fiquei permanentemente marcada por Robert. Quando sua virgindade é tirada por um pedófilo aos 14 anos… sua vida nunca é sua.”
Robert Sylvester Kelly, o cantor R. Kelly foi condenado em 29 de junho de 2022 a 30 anos de prisão. Ele é acusado de liderar por décadas uma rede tráfico e abuso sexual, inclusive usando a fama para fazer vítimas com fins sexuais. O júri formado por cinco mulheres e sete homens o considerou culpado. A defesa do músico pediu que a pena não ultrapasse 17 anos.
O artista já havia sido considerado culpado em setembro do ano passado por crimes de extorsão e tráfico sexual. Ao determinar, agora, a pena, a juíza Ann Donnelly afirmou que o cantor de 55 anos mostrou “indiferença ao sofrimento humano”.
De acordo com a acusação, R. Kelly comandava um esquema ilegal envolvendo empresários, seguranças e outras pessoas que recrutavam mulheres e meninas para ele fazer sexo e produzir pornografia.
Para os promotores, a equipe do artista de 55 anos o apoiava ou fingia que não via os comportamentos criminosos do músico. Em documento, a promotoria afirmou que os atos do cantor eram insolentes, manipuladores, controladores e coercitivos.
“Uma longa pena de prisão impedirá outros – ricos, famosos e com excesso de poder, com aquele concedido pelo seu status – de cometer este tipo de crime”, escreveram os promotores.
Uma mulher que usou o pseudônimo Addie relatou no tribunal que foi estuprada por R. Kelly nos bastidores de um show em Miami após ela e uma amiga serem abordardadas por dois homens “que pareciam seguranças” e as convidaram para visitar o camarim.
Nos anos 2000, R. Kelly chegou a ser considerado como o Rei do R&B. Em sua carreira, ele vendeu 75 milhões de discos após o sucesso de hits como “I Believe I Can Fly” e “Ignition”.",2023-08-30T23:00:00Z,https://www.ofuxico.com.br,OFuxico

Inhaftierter R. Kelly muss Opfern über zehn Millionen Dollar zahlen,"Nach zwei Gefängnisstrafen ist der ehemalige Musik-Star R. Kelly nun zu einer Geldstrafe in Höhe von über zehn Millionen US-Dollar verurteilt worden.
1/5 R. Kelly wird die nächsten drei Jahrzehnte im Gefängnis verbringen.
Der verurteilte Sexualstraftäter R. Kelly (56) ist in einem weiteren Gerichtsprozess zu seiner Strafzahlung in zweistelliger Millionenhöhe verdonnert worden. Der einstige Musik-Superstar muss Gerichtsdokumenten zufolge, die der US-amerikanischen Seite «TMZ» vorliegen, sechs seiner Opfer zusammengenommen 10,5 Millionen US-Dollar (etwa 9,7 Millionen Euro) zahlen. Für die einzelnen Frauen ergebe sich so eine Entschädigungssumme von zwischen 1,1 (circa eine Million Euro) und 2,25 Millionen US-Dollar (circa zwei Millionen Euro).
Neben Kelly muss auch dessen ehemaliger Manager Donnell Russell für diese Summe geradestehen, heisst es weiter. Der Grund für die die Strafe: Gemeinsam sollen die beiden Männer mit einer perfiden Drohung versucht haben, im Jahr 2018 eine Vorführung der Dokuserie «Surviving R. Kelly» zu unterbinden. Zunächst habe das Duo versucht, die in der Doku zu Wort kommenden Frauen und die Produzenten der Serie einzuschüchtern.

Frauen bedroht: R. Kelly muss Opfern über zehn Millionen Dollar zahlen,"Die Einschüchterungstaktik hatte zwar Erfolg, kommt den Musiker aber jetzt teuer zu stehen.
Um die Vorführung der Doku ""Surviving R. Kelly"" zu verhindern, bedrohen R. Kelly und sein Manager die Opfer des Musikers: Sie würden den Veranstaltungsort ""kaputt schießen"" lassen, sollte das Event nicht abgesagt werden. Ein Gericht verurteilt den Sänger dafür jetzt zu einer Millionen-Zahlung.

Wegen Drohungen: R. Kelly muss Opfern 10 Mio. Euro zahlen!,"Chicago – Den ehemaligen Opfern von R. Kelly, die in der Doku „Surviving R. Kelly“ auftraten, wurde eine Entschädigung über 10 Millionen Euro zugesprochen. Weil sie von Kelly und dessen Manager bedroht wurden. Das berichtet das News-Portal „TMZ“.
Sänger R. Kelly (bürgerlich Robert Kelly, 56) wurde im Juni 2022 wegen Missbrauchs von Minderjährigen zu 30 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt. Und die sitzt er derzeit im Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center ab.
Laut Dokumenten, die TMZ vorliegen, erhalten sechs Opfer des Sängers insgesamt 9,7 Millionen Euro von Kelly und seinem ehemaligen Manager Donnell Russell. Die Frauen hatten Kelly und Russell wegen des Versuchs verklagt, eine New Yorker Vorführung von „Surviving“ im Dezember 2018 zu verhindern.
Der „I Believe I Can Fly“-Interpret soll bereits im Mai 2018 versucht haben, die Frauen und Produzenten einzuschüchtern. Als das, einschließlich rechtlicher Drohungen, fehlschlug, sollen Kellys verbündet am Abend der Vorführung in New York die Produzenten angerufen und gesagt haben, jemand werde „an dem Ort alle erschießen“.
Die vorgetäuschte Massenerschießungsdrohung funktionierte, die Veranstaltung wurde abgebrochen. Das habe bei den Frauen ein vergangenes Trauma aufgewühlt und dazu geführt, dass sie jetzt unter posttraumatischer Belastungsstörungen und Panikattacken leiden, berichten die Opfer.
Jede der sechs Frauen soll zwischen 1 und 2,3 Millionen Euro erhalten. Ob sie das Geld tatsächlich bekommen, ist unklar. Die Musik von R. Kelly generiert zwar immer noch Einnahmen, aber ein großer Teil der Tantiemen wird bereits für die Entschädigung verwendet, die den Opfern wegen der Sexualverbrechen zustehen.",2023-08-26T02:30:19Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD

"R. Kelly and Universal Music Group to pay $520,549 in royalties to his victims, judge orders","More than half a million of R. Kelly’s music royalties held by the Universal Music Group will be given to his sex abuse victims, a New York judge has ordered.
On Wednesday (23.08.23), US District Judge Ann Donnelly ruled that the disgraced R’n’B star will have to give up $520,549 from his music publisher to cover the cost of unpaid restitution and fines.
UMG has 10 days to hand over the cash.
Sony’s royalties of more than $1.5 million are being sought by a Chicago child pornography victim, who was awarded $4 million, as Kelly still owes them $42,000 in fines and restitution.
However, Sony Music won’t have to hand over any more money this time, as the Universal royalties are enough to foot the rest of the fines.
The judge had previously ordered the ‘Ignition’ hitmaker to pay $28,000 to cover his unpaid fines.
Kelly is serving 30 years in prison for his 2021 racketeering and sex trafficking convictions in New York.
He was found guilty of all nine counts against him, including racketeering and violations of the Mann Act, which prohibits the transport of “any woman or girl” across state lines for any “immoral purpose”.
The singer denied all the charges he faced.

He had faced years of allegations and the judge said he showed an “indifference to human suffering” after the court heard how Kelly forced his victims into “obedience” and “horrors”.
The singer did not appear to react as his sentence was passed, but his lawyer insisted he wanted to speak at his sentencing.
Jennifer Bonjean added she advised him against it while he had open cases in Chicago and Minnesota.
During the Chicago pornography trial, the jury viewed segments of videos of Kelly sexually abusing an underage girl, who was the singer’s goddaughter.
The girl, who went by ‘Jane’ during the trial, said Kelly began sexually abusing her when he was only 14, and when she turned 15, she told the jury that they began having sexual intercourse “innumerable times”, adding the instances were “uncountable”.
Jane said in a statement: “I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly … I have been permanently scarred by Robert.
“When your virginity is taken by a paedophile at 14... your life is never your own.”
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym ‘Nia’ during the trial addressed Kelly directly and said: “Now you are here... because there is something wrong with you.
“No longer will you be able to harm children.”",2023-08-25T07:10:07Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow

More than $500,000 in royalties earned by R. Kelly will be garnished to pay victims of his sex trafficking scheme, a Brooklyn judge ruled Wednesday.
Universal Music Group has held the money since Kelly was charged with several sex trafficking and child pornography crimes in New York and Chicago. UMG must pay $520,549, according to Billboard.

Federal prosecutors had initially targeted UMG and Sony Music Entertainment for the garnishment. However, Universal held $567,444, enough to cover the entire debt, so Sony was dropped from the claim.
Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, has appealed his convictions and told Billboard the team of lawyers “will seek the return of every cent that has been wrongfully taken from him.”

R. Kelly was convicted in Brooklyn Federal Court in September 2021 of running a decades-long sex trafficking scheme that targeted his young fans, both male and female, some of whom were underage.
Nine months later, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison and fined around $500,000. While law enforcement officers hauled him behind bars, Kelly never produced the money. In court filings, his lawyers said he was broke.
Though Judge Ann Donnelly approved the garnishment on Wednesday, it will likely not be the last battle over Kelly’s money.
The “Ignition” artist, 56, was successfully sued by one of his victims in civil court, and the judge awarded the victim $4 million — which has also not yet been paid.
Additionally, a landlord who owned Kelly’s music studio in Chicago is seeking $3.5 million in unpaid rent. And Kelly was fined $42,000 after he was convicted separately in Chicago of enticing minors for sex and child pornography.",2023-08-24T23:06:00Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News
R. Kelly's Universal Music pay must go to sex abuse victims,"More than half a million dollars in R. Kelly’s music royalties held by the Universal Music Group must be turned over to his sex abuse victims, a New York judge ruled.
US District Judge Ann Donnelly signed an order Wednesday ordering UMG, the disgraced R&B singer’s music publisher, to hand over $520,549 to cover unpaid restitution and fines.
Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June 2022 for sexually abusing women and underage girls and boys over the course of decades.
UMG has 10 days to deliver the money to pay the debt, according to the court documents.
Following UMG’s agreement to hand over the cash to victims, prosecutors said they would drop their move to go after Sony’s royalties of more than $1.5 million.

The “Ignition” singer, 56, still owes more than $42,000 in fines and restitution in that case, Billboard reports.
Jennifer Bonjean, Kelly’s attorney, said in a statement that she will seek to have the payments returned to her client as she is currently appealing both his convictions.

Representatives for UMG and Sony did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.
The move to go after Kelly’s royalties came after Donnelly ordered the fallen 90s R&B icon to surrender nearly $28,000 in his prison inmate account to pay his victims.
Donnelly had rejected the defense’s claim that prosecutors had taken “unprecedented” steps in freezing all but $500 in Kelly’s account.
Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison last year in New York, and 20 years in his Chicago trial. AP
In addition to his sentencing in New York on federal racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, Kelly was sentenced in February to 20 years in prison in a separate Chicago case — but with nearly all the time having to be served simultaneously with the 30-year sentence.

Two years after a jury convicted the singer of sex trafficking and racketeering – and a year after she sentenced him to 30 years in prison — Judge Ann Donnelly signed a so-called writ of garnishment directing UMG to hand over $520,549 in his publishing royalties to pay restitution and criminal fines.
Prosecutors had moved to seize royalties held both by UMG and by Sony Music Entertainment, Kelly’s former label. But because UMG’s account held enough to cover the entire penalty (UMG disclosed to the judge it was holding $567,444) prosecutors said Wednesday they would drop their request to tap Sony’s account.
That doesn’t mean Sony will be keeping Kelly’s funds, though. The label, which held more than $1.5 million in Kelly royalties as of 2020, is facing other demands to access that money – to an abuse victim who won a $4 million civil judgment, as well as a Chicago landlord that’s owed $3.5 million.
Federal prosecutors in Chicago, who won a separate conviction against Kelly on child pornography charges, could also seek to collect money, either from Sony or from the remaining funds in UMG’s account. Kelly owes more than $42,000 in fines and restitution in that case.
A spokesman for UMG declined to comment. A spokesman for Sony did not return a request for comment. In a statement to Billboard, Jennifer Bonjean – Kelly’s attorney, who is currently appealing his convictions – vowed that the royalty money would eventually be returned to her client.
“We maintain that Mr. Kelly’s convictions and the restitution orders were erroneous and the Second Circuit will have the final word on it,” Bonjean said, referring to the U.S. Court of Appeal. “I can promise that when the Second Circuit reverses Mr. Kelly’s convictions, we will seek the return of every cent that has been wrongfully taken from him.”
After decades of accusations of sexual misconduct, Kelly was convicted in New York in 2021 on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from accusations that he orchestrated a long-running scheme to recruit and abuse women and underage girls. Last summer, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
In September 2022, he was convicted in Chicago on separate of federal charges of child pornography and enticement of minors for sex. Kelly was sentenced to 20 years on those convictions in February, but he will serve nearly all of the time simultaneously with the earlier 30-year sentence.",2023-08-24T14:50:42Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy: ‘I can’t regret working with R Kelly - it made me better able to judge my behaviour and that of others’,"Your work is often considered to be bleak, dark and mostly for grownups. Given your young offspring, what children’s songs do you find yourself singing? Grimpeurs
One of the earliest Sesame Street characters is a fellow called Grover, who is blue with a big pink nose. Last week, in the children’s section of a record store, I found a record called Grover Sings the Blues. I hadn’t heard What Do I Do When I’m Alone? or Has Anyone Seen My Dog? in 45 years but my daughter has been playing them over and over again. It’s so gratifying that she likes the songs I liked as a child in the 1970s. I still know every word and note.
What drew you to cover Mariah Carey’s Can’t Take That Away (Mariah’s Theme)? ChanteuseV
Around the time of that record she had a very public breakdown that had to do with the demands of having a very public persona. It almost destroyed her and she cried out for help. We allow terrible things to be done to people we admire or the planet and tend to look the other way, but it’s such a powerful song. A friend of mine had been in jail with a rapper who knew the Wu-Tang Clan producer Buddha Monk, so we went to his apartment and did that song with Buddha’s brilliant production.
Will Oldham … ‘I don’t listen to R Kelly now.’
Do you regret associating with R Kelly after the first abuse allegations against him? CaptainShabby
When I did the Mariah Carey song at Buddha’s, the TV had news about the first R Kelly scandals coming out. They were serious allegations, yet R Kelly’s 2003 album Chocolate Factory was No 1. I bought it and thought it was tremendous. I listened to more of his music, covered one of his songs, then I was brought to Texas to potentially make music for the film of the food industry book Fast Food Nation. In one of the scenes an R Kelly video was playing in the background. It turned out a woman on the film worked with R Kelly and she asked if I’d like to be in the Trapped in the Closet video. They flew me to Chicago, we rehearsed at his house and I interviewed him for Interview magazine. I live covered Ignition Part 1, and recorded his song The World’s Greatest for the movie Ali. So I had multiple associations. I can’t regret them because, ideally, the closer I was to that man, his music and his world – and even the horrific and tragic complications that have since come to light – would make me a stronger person, better able to make judgments on my behaviour and the behaviour of others. You know, as a child Bill Cosby conned me because he presented his work through the lens of morality. R Kelly never did. But I don’t listen to R Kelly now.
During the infamous 9/11 jam session, who was most shaken by the day’s events – Jason Molina, Alasdair Roberts or yourself? FizzyGua
We were recording at my brother’s old farmhouse in Kentucky and were already in unfamiliar territory, exploring each other’s ways of working. My brother got a phone call and it was obvious something very significant was happening. We were able to watch the second plane hit the building live, but we didn’t know what to do. So we got back to work. I’d say Molina’s reaction was the most interesting because of his ability to spontaneously improvise lyrics. He came up with the song September 11 on the spot.

How do you end up taking the photograph that became the front cover of Slint’s seminal album Spiderland? Clewballs
We were super-close friends and when they started the band I was invited to join. I’d never played music, but was so touched and honoured it felt like a suitable challenge. At their first show under the name Small Dirty Tight Tufts of Hair: BEADS, in a Unitarian church, I just sat down in front of Brett Walford’s kick drum to stop it sliding. Eventually I dropped out, but for the cover of their first record, Tweez, they used a picture of me that my father took. Then they asked me to take the one for Spiderland. A couple of years ago, we went back to the abandoned limestone quarry where we took it and took pictures of ourselves swimming in the water like we had when we were teenagers.
Why did you decide to take all your solo work off Spotify? phil2282
I am offended by Spotify’s existence and people’s passive acceptance of it as a dominant form of musical consumption. They treat musicians like garbage. When people go “it’s just so easy”, I think: “So you don’t want musicians to continue to try to make the best music they can?” Because it’s unsustainable. When I play a song, I want to be reminded of where I heard it or who recommended it, not that my algorithm told me.
What do you recall of the fantastic film Matewan? How did you get the part and are you annoyed that you never got to play a Jason Bourne bad guy, like your fellow cast members, Chris Cooper and David Strathairn? Haigin88
I love those Jason Bourne movies, but by the time they were made I’d realised the movie business was not conducive to my temperament or vice versa. I got the part because I’d done a lot of regional theatre. I was 16 years old and just tried to follow actors like Ken Jenkins, Chris Cooper and Mary McDonnell. The film is about the Matewan mining massacre in the Appalachian hills and to this day I get college professors say: “I teach that movie in my labour history class.” It’s impossible to list all the ways the making of it influenced the way I make records. The director, John Sayles, is in the video for a song on my new album called Crazy Blue Bells. He’s uncredited but if you know what he looks like you can’t miss him. He’s almost seven feet tall and very handsome.
Watch the video for Crazy Blue Bells.
Sinéad O’Connor’s death reminded me that you used to cover All Babies from her Universal Mother album. With songs you cover, do you dig deep on an artist or simply hear something and want to sing it? icyberg
Mostly you hear a song that you wish you could have written. With that song, it’s her voice, the way it makes me feel, a connection with some or all of the lyrics. Then you want to deepen your relationship with the song and learn how it was created, to strengthen your own practice.
Is it true you like to bodyboard? Thepuffpastryhangman
I actually like to bodysurf – surfing without the board. It just makes my brain and body feel good. My favourite wave is a dangerous and slightly daunting wave at Makapu‘u Beach on the island of O‘ahu in Hawaii. There’s a similarly frightening wave nearby in Sandy Beach – there’s a famous photo of Barack Obama bodysurfing there.
Your latest album, Keeping Secrets Will Destroy You, features volcanic imagery on the opener Like It or Not, and closes with a song entitled Good Morning, Popocatépetl (“smoking mountain”). You were also writer in residence at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park in 2018. Are you drawn to volcanoes? VerulamiumParkRanger
I’m grateful for such a beautiful question. I think volcanoes are such a dramatic, traumatic, greatest example of the way the planet we live on is a living, breathing thing. They are beautiful and horrific to witness. In January 2018, my wife and I spent a month in Hawaii living on an active volcano and you could trek out to where lava was popping out of the ground. Three months later that volcano erupted and destroyed wonderful places. They are beautiful role models for the way, as artists or human beings in general, we are creating and destroying, and are microbacteria compared with the planet we live on.

Who is Birdman, the guitarist on your 2022 album High and High and Mighty Parts 1 and 2? FizzyGua
I made that album for my friend Emmett Kelly’s primarily cassette-only label, Haha. It’s a piece of work I feel most strongly about but I’m not at liberty to say who Birdman was. He’s an incredible musician, but also an academic who researches gun ownership. Even though we only made 100 copies, he was concerned that if he was identified his family might be in danger. I was devastated because I’d been looking forward to years of collaboration, but we agreed on a pseudonym. Fortunately, he didn’t say: “Don’t put it out.”
Your Merle Haggard tribute album, Best Troubadour, led me to discover and now love his music. How did that record come about? graham627
I’ve explored his music for decades and think that in the last 20 years of his life he made some of the greatest work in country music. Sometimes I’d even write songs thinking of him – a specific one is I Called You Back – and hoping that one day he’d hear them. His live shows were dominated by his earlier work, so I wanted to make a record to highlight his later brilliance. Then in 2016 he died. I didn’t know what to do about the album, but read that he’d made Roots, Volume 1 for the indie label Anti- by recording live to two-track. I spoke to his engineer for advice and we did Best Troubadour the same way. It’s one of the most rewarding things I’ve ever done. Unlike most artists, Merle Haggard continued to develop. His only formula was to continually challenge himself.",2023-08-24T14:00:41Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian
DeSantis on Trump pardon: Not good ‘for almost 80-year-old former president’ to serve time,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said on the possibility of him issuing a pardon for former President Trump that he does not believe having “an almost 80-year-old former president” serve time in prison is in the country’s interest.
DeSantis said during an interview on Megyn Kelly’s podcast, looking at the example of then-President Ford pardoning former President Nixon over Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, that the move caused Ford to receive some backlash, but it allowed the country to move forward.
“I’m going to do what’s right for the country. I don’t think it would be good for the country to have an almost 80-year-old former president go to prison. It doesn’t seem like it would be a good thing,” he said.
The interview first aired on SiriusXM.
DeSantis said he believes the country wants a “fresh start,” and leaders need to focus on the issues facing people.
His comments come as Trump could soon face additional charges over his actions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and broader efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
He has already been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York over a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels and a range of counts, including willful retention of national defense information, over his possession of classified and sensitive documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida after his presidency.
The Justice Department filed an updated superseding indictment against Trump on Thursday adding additional charges against him in the classified documents case, accusing him of trying to delete surveillance footage that was to be used in the investigation.
The hush money case is in state court and would not be under the purview of the president’s pardon power, but the documents and Jan. 6 cases are federal investigations that Trump could be pardoned for by the president.
DeSantis previously said in May that he would consider pardoning Jan. 6 defendants determined to be victims of “political targeting,” potentially including Trump.
He told Kelly that Trump could have “leaned in harder” to try to stop the unrest during the Jan. 6 attack, but he questioned if the former president’s conduct reached the level of being criminal.
“You can identify flawed conduct. You can criticize his conduct. But you have to find a statue that was violated,” DeSantis said.
Trump revealed last week that he received a letter from special counsel Jack Smith’s office notifying him that he is a target of the Jan. 6 investigation, often a sign that criminal charges are impending.

Ayotte announces run for New Hampshire governor,"Former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) announced Monday that she’s running for governor in New Hampshire, capping off speculation about her plans on the open gubernatorial seat.
“The battle to protect our Live Free or Die way of life must continue. I’m running for Governor because New Hampshire is one election away from becoming Massachusetts – from becoming something we are not,” Ayotte said in a statement that touched on issues including crime, energy costs and the economy.
“I was born here and raised here. I raised my kids here, and you know what? I am going to die here because this state and it’s people are different. What we have here is worth fighting for,” she added.
Ayotte served as senator in the Granite State for one term before losing reelection in 2016 to Sen. Maggie Hassan (D). Before her Senate term, she served as New Hampshire’s attorney general.
The one-term senator’s announcement makes her the second major Republican to enter the race; former state Senate President Chuck Morse has also thrown his hat in the ring.
On the Democratic side, Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig and Executive Councilor Cinde Warmington are also running for the governor’s mansion.
Gov. Chris Sununu (R) announced last week that he wasn’t running for another term, after winning a fourth term last November. Nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report has rated the gubernatorial race as a “toss up.”",2023-07-24T13:32:55Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
"Η σκιτσογράφος δικαστηρίου που δημιούργησε ένα ιστορικό εξώφυλλο του περιοδικού ""New Yorker""","Το 1935, στις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες διεξαγόταν η δίκη για το λεγόμενο «έγκλημα του αιώνα». Ο Μπρούνο Χόπτμαν κατηγορούνταν ότι είχε απαγάγει και δολοφονήσει τον γιο του διάσημου πιλότου Τσαρλς Λίντμπεργκ. Η υπόθεση καταγράφηκε από περισσότερες από 120 κάμερες μέσα στη δικαστική αίθουσα.
Εκείνη την εποχή, ο Λίντμπεργκ – ήδη ένας Αμερικανός ήρωας επειδή ήταν ο πρώτος που πέταξε από τη Νέα Υόρκη στο Παρίσι με το αεροπλάνο του το 1927 – είχε τη συμπάθεια της χώρας για έναν πολύ πιο σπαρακτικό λόγο: Τα λείψανα του 20 μηνών μωρού του είχαν βρεθεί σε ένα δάσος κοντά στο σπίτι του στο Νιου Τζέρσεϊ, αφού ο πιλότος είχε καταβάλει λύτρα 50.000 δολαρίων.
Δείτε το βίντεο
Μια αναχρονιστική δουλειά
Κανείς δεν αμφισβήτησε την ετυμηγορία που έκρινε τον Χόπτμαν ένοχο, αλλά ο ίδιος άσκησε έφεση με το σκεπτικό ότι το τσίρκο των μέσων ενημέρωσης που τον περιέβαλε του είχε στερήσει το δικαίωμα σε μια δίκαιη δίκη.
Η έφεσή του ήταν ανεπιτυχής, αλλά παρακίνησε τον Αμερικανικό Δικηγορικό Σύλλογο να απαγορεύσει την πρόσβαση καμερών στις αίθουσες δικαστηρίων. Αυτός ο κανόνας είναι έκτοτε αμφιλεγόμενος και η απαγόρευση εφαρμόζεται άνισα σε διάφορες πολιτείες της χώρας.
Η απαγόρευση των καμερών έχει επίσης συζητηθεί επανειλημμένα σε υποθέσεις που αφορούν το τσίρκο των μέσων ενημέρωσης, όπως η δίκη του Ο Τζέι Σίμπσον και, πιο πρόσφατα, η αγωγή της Γκουίνεθ Πάλτροου.
Η Νέα Υόρκη, ωστόσο, δεν κατήργησε ποτέ την απαγόρευση- πέρα από το ερώτημα αν είναι περισσότερο ή λιγότερο επίκαιρη στην εποχή της παγκόσμιας μιντιακής φρενίτιδας, αυτό σημαίνει ότι άνθρωποι όπως η Τζέιν Ρόζενμπεργκ έχουν μια από τις πιο ιδιόμορφες -και ίσως αναχρονιστικές- δουλειές στον κόσμο: Σκιτσογράφος δικαστηρίου.
Η viral στιγμή της
Σε μια συνομιλία στο Zoom από το σπίτι της στο Μπρούκλιν, η Ρόζενμπεργκ εξηγεί ότι από τότε που άρχισε να εργάζεται ως σκιτσογράφος σε δικαστικές αίθουσες το 1980, ο κόσμος έλεγε ότι η δουλειά της θα εξαφανιστεί.
Παρά την πανταχού παρουσία της φωτογραφίας και του βίντεο, ή ίσως εξαιτίας της, η Νεοϋορκέζα (η οποία δεν έχει λογαριασμούς στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης) βιώνει μια μικρή αλλά εξαιρετική στιγμή viral φήμης.
Ο λόγος είναι το πορτρέτο που έφτιαξε στον Ντόναλντ Τραμπ κατά την απαγγελία κατηγορίας του στις 4 Απριλίου νωρίτερα φέτος. Μετά την έκρηξη των μέσων ενημέρωσης, το σκίτσο της έγινε το πρώτο του είδους του που κοσμεί το εξώφυλλο του New Yorker.
«Έκανα δύο σκίτσα εκείνη την ημέρα. Στο πρώτο, ο Ντόναλντ Τραμπ απλώς καθόταν εκεί χωρίς πραγματική έκφραση. Και την επόμενη φορά που τον σκιτσάρισα, μόλις είχε δηλώσει αθώος. Έτσι, σκέφτηκα, ω, πρέπει να το αποτυπώσω αυτό: Να μιλάει στο μικρόφωνο. Αλλά όταν έφτασα στο χαρτί μου, είχε γυρίσει και κοίταξε επίμονα τον εισαγγελέα. Και τον έβλεπα με αυτή την έκφραση. Έτσι, σκέφτηκα, ω, πρέπει να το καταγράψω αυτό» εξηγεί.
Ζωγράφισε τον δολοφόνο του Τζον Λένον
Το 1981, όταν η Ρόζενμπεργκ ξεκινούσε για πρώτη φορά την καριέρα της, ζωγράφισε τον δολοφόνο του Τζον Λένον.
«Η πρώτη μεγάλη υπόθεση που θυμάμαι ήταν όταν ο Μαρκ Ντέιβιντ Τσάπμαν πυροβόλησε τον Τζον Λένον… Και θυμάμαι να πηγαίνω στο δικαστήριο, να κοιτάζω τον δικηγόρο του και σκέφτηκα, πώς μπορεί αυτός ο δικηγόρος να εκπροσωπεί αυτόν τον τύπο; Και τώρα είμαι παντρεμένη με δικηγόρο υπεράσπισης και καταλαβαίνω πώς λειτουργεί το σύστημα, ότι όλοι έχουν δικαίωμα σε υπεράσπιση».
Στη συνέχεια, το 1993, κάλυψε τη δίκη για την επιμέλεια των παιδιών του Γούντι Άλεν και της Μία Φάρου. «Ήταν πολύ πριν από το MeToo. Σε εκείνη τη δίκη δεν κρίθηκε ένοχος για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση. Αφορούσε την επιμέλεια, ποιος είναι καλύτερος γονέας για να μεγαλώσει αυτά τα παιδιά… Και δεν γνώριζε κανέναν από τους παιδικούς σταθμούς των παιδιών, δεν γνώριζε κανέναν από τους γιατρούς τους. Έτσι, έχασε την επιμέλεια. Δεν κέρδισε τη μάχη για την κηδεμονία» θυμάται με σοβαρότητα.
Το σκίτσο της είναι ανεπηρέαστο
Εξηγεί ότι εργάζεται για να αντικατοπτρίζει την πραγματικότητα των όσων συμβαίνουν στο δικαστήριο. «Η δουλειά μου είναι να δείχνω ακριβώς τι συμβαίνει. Η γνώμη μου δεν έχει καμία σχέση με το σκίτσο μου. Αν κάποιος κλαίει ή κάποιος γελάει, αν πετάγεται από τη θέση του, πρέπει να αποτυπώσω αυτή τη στιγμή, ό,τι κι αν είναι- είναι εν μέρει δημοσιογραφία. Αυτή είναι η δουλειά μου» δηλώνει.
Ένα άλλο από τα viral σκίτσα της είναι από τη δίκη της Γκισλέιν Μάξγουελ το 2021.
Η Μάξγουελ, το δεξί χέρι του Τζέφρι Επστάιν στο κύκλωμα εμπορίας παιδιών, ανέλαβε να ζωγραφίσει η ίδια τη Ρόζενμπεργκ και η Ρόζενμπεργκ σχεδίασε ένα μετα-σκίτσο. Η ίδια λέει ότι δεν ήταν η πρώτη φορά: Αυτό συνέβη και με τον Έντι Μέρφι, ο οποίος τη ζωγράφισε να τον ζωγραφίζει.
Θυμάται επίσης τη εντυπωσιακή ασφάλεια στην υπόθεση του 2019 κατά του Μεξικανού εμπόρου ναρκωτικών Χοακίν –Ελ Τσάπο- Γκουσμάν, η οποία την έκανε να κολλήσει σε ένα ταξί πριν καν διασχίσει τη γέφυρα του Μπρούκλιν.
Πώς έφτασε να κάνει αυτό το ασυνήθιστο επάγγελμα;
Σχετικά με τις πιο αρνητικές αντιδράσεις σε κάποια πορτρέτα της -όπως όταν οι οπαδοί του Τομ Μπρέιντι διαμαρτυρήθηκαν για το πόσο άχαρα τον είχε απεικονίσει- η Ρόζενμπεργκ παρατηρεί ότι «τις διασημότητες είναι λίγο πιο δύσκολο να τις ζωγραφίσεις. Πρέπει πραγματικά να πετύχεις την ομοιότητά τους, επειδή όλοι νομίζουν ότι ξέρουν πώς είναι από τις ταινίες, αλλά σε μια αίθουσα δικαστηρίου έχουν διαφορετικό φωτισμό. Κάθονται εκεί σε φωτισμό φθορισμού χωρίς μακιγιάζ ή οτιδήποτε άλλο» λέει.
Η Ρόζενμπεργκ κατέληξε σε αυτό το ασυνήθιστο επάγγελμα όταν συνειδητοποίησε ότι το να κάνει πορτραίτα αξίας 1 δολαρίου σε τουριστικές περιοχές στο Κέιπ Κοντ της Μασαχουσέτης δεν ήταν τρόπος να βγάλει τα προς το ζην.
«Μετά το κολλέγιο, ήμουν μια καλλιτέχνις που πάλευε. Έκανα ό,τι μπορούσα για να βγάλω λεφτά και να κερδίσω τα προς το ζην. Ήταν πολύ δύσκολο. Και τότε είδα μια διάλεξη από έναν άλλο καλλιτέχνη δικαστηρίου στο Society of Illustrators…
»Ποτέ δεν σκέφτηκα να είμαι σε δικαστήριο. Όταν είδα αυτή τη διάλεξη, σκέφτηκα, ω, αυτό μοιάζει με κάτι που θα ήθελα πολύ να κάνω, αλλά δεν ξέρω αν είμαι αρκετά καλός. Και μετά είχα φίλους δικηγόρους που με πήγαν στο δικαστήριο και τους έκανα ένα εκατομμύριο ερωτήσεις όπως, πού καθόταν ο καλλιτέχνης; Τι έφεραν; Μου είπαν, έλα την επόμενη εβδομάδα- θα σε αφήσουμε να καθίσεις με τα μέσα ενημέρωσης.
»Έτσι, πήγα και κάθισα στο έδρανο των ενόρκων. Υπήρχαν άλλοι δύο καλλιτέχνες. Έκανα το σκίτσο μου και σκέφτηκα ότι πρέπει πραγματικά να το δοκιμάσω. Το NBC κατέληξε να χρησιμοποιήσει το σκίτσο μου, γυρίζοντάς το σε φιλμ. Και γύρισα σπίτι και το παρακολούθησα στη μικρή ασπρόμαυρη τηλεόρασή μου στο σαλόνι μου. Και τηλεφώνησα στους γονείς μου» θυμάται.
Μέσα ενημέρωσης και δικαιοσύνη
Στα 43 χρόνια των δημοσιογραφικών σκίτσων στα δικαστήρια, η Ρόζενμπεργκ υπήρξε μάρτυρας της εξέλιξης δύο πυλώνων της δημοκρατίας: Των μέσων ενημέρωσης και της δικαιοσύνης.
Είναι πιο αισιόδοξη για το δεύτερο παρά για το πρώτο. «Φαίνεται ότι υπάρχουν θέματα. Στις δεκαετίες που ασχολούμαι με την τέχνη των δικαστικών αιθουσών, επί 43 χρόνια, υπάρχουν υποθέσεις μαφίας για μεγάλο χρονικό διάστημα.
»Υπήρχαν πολλές υποθέσεις τρομοκρατίας. Για μεγάλο χρονικό διάστημα, υπήρχαν επιχειρήσεις, ο Μπέρναντ Μάντοφ και όλα αυτά. Και τώρα φαίνεται να υπάρχει ένα θέμα MeToo. Φαίνεται ότι πολλές από τις υποθέσεις που κάνω είναι MeToo.
»Πάντα υπήρχαν υποθέσεις αστυνομικής βίας από την αρχή μέχρι σήμερα. Και δεν υπήρχαν κινητά τηλέφωνα όταν ξεκίνησα. Έτσι, στην πρώτη υπόθεση αστυνομικής βίας, δεν υπήρχε βίντεο, όπως στην υπόθεση του Τζορτζ Φλόιντ. Και νομίζω ότι οι ένορκοι έκαναν πάντα το σωστό» λέει.
Πώς τα βλέπει τα πράγματα;
«Δεν αισθάνομαι ότι υπήρξε εξέλιξη του συστήματος δικαιοσύνης. Αισθάνομαι ενδεχομένως ότι υπήρξε εξέλιξη των μέσων ενημέρωσης, για τα οποία εργάζομαι. Όταν ξεκίνησα, υπήρχαν μόνο τρεις μεγάλοι τηλεοπτικοί σταθμοί και οι ειδήσεις ήταν μόνο στις έξι και επτά.
»Και στη συνέχεια ήταν στις πέντε, έξι και επτά. Μετά υπήρχε μια μεσημεριανή εκπομπή. Έτσι, οι προθεσμίες μου γίνονταν όλο και πιο γρήγορες. Τώρα, είναι 24 ώρες το 24ωρο. Τώρα πρέπει να βγάζω τα σκετς μου εκεί έξω όσο πιο γρήγορα μπορώ. Με περιμένουν. Βγάλτε το τώρα. Αυτό είναι λοιπόν που εξελίχθηκε» λέει η Ρόζενμπεργκ.
Στο αποκορύφωμα της πανδημίας του Covid-19, η σκιτσογράφος έπρεπε επίσης να κάνει τα πορτρέτα της μέσω τηλεδιάσκεψης (για παράδειγμα, έκανε σκίτσα για τις δίκες των ταραξιών στο Καπιτώλιο) και συνέχισε ακόμη και να κάνει πορτρέτα κατηγορουμένων και μαρτύρων φορώντας τις μάσκες του προσώπου τους.
Τα υπαρκτά εμπόδια
Αναφέρει τις δυσκολίες που αντιμετώπισε στην υπόθεση της δημοσιογράφου Τζιν Κάρολ – η οποία κατηγόρησε τον Ντόναλντ Τραμπ ότι τη βίασε – ως αποτέλεσμα του αριθμού των υπολογιστών και των οθονών που της εμπόδιζαν τη θέα του ενάγοντος.
Είναι αγχωτικό; «Είναι πιο αγχωτικό να ξεκινάς από την πρώτη ημέρα της υπόθεσης. Ποτέ δεν ξέρω τι πρόκειται να αντιμετωπίσω. Δεν ξέρω πού θα καθίσω. Οι δίκες είναι διαφορετικές από τις προσαγωγές ή τις ακροάσεις. Είναι τόσο γρήγορες… Αλλά μια δίκη παίρνει πραγματικά χρόνο για να συμβεί κάτι» εξηγεί.
Μαλακώνει όταν κάνει έναν απολογισμό του τι σημαίνει η καριέρα της γι’ αυτήν: «Αγαπώ τη δουλειά μου. Αισθάνομαι ότι προσφέρω δημόσια υπηρεσία. Και παρόλο που δεν έχω πολύ χρόνο για την προσωπική μου ζωή, εξακολουθεί να είναι συναρπαστικό για μένα να παρακολουθώ μια δίκη.
»Νιώθω ότι σχεδόν κάθε μέρα κάθομαι μπροστά σε μια εκπομπή με κάποιο τρόπο».
Ωστόσο, επιστρέφοντας στο αρχικό σημείο, υποστηρίζει ότι, με ή χωρίς αυτήν, η εκπομπή πρέπει να προστατευτεί από τη σόουμπιζ. «Νομίζω ότι η αίθουσα του δικαστηρίου είναι ένας ιερός χώρος. Δεν νομίζω ότι πρέπει να μετατρέπεται σε ψυχαγωγία. Νομίζω ότι πολλοί άνθρωποι φοβούνται να βρεθούν μπροστά στην κάμερα. Οι μάρτυρες μπορεί να είναι φοβισμένοι. Οι δικηγόροι μπορεί να παίζουν στις κάμερες. Υπάρχει μεγάλη δύναμη σε ένα δωμάτιο μοντάζ για το τι βγαίνει στην τηλεόραση».

Εκείνη την εποχή, ο Λίντμπεργκ – ήδη ένας Αμερικανός ήρωας επειδή ήταν ο πρώτος που πέταξε από τη Νέα Υόρκη στο Παρίσι με το αεροπλάνο του το 1927 – είχε τη συμπάθεια της χώρας για έναν πολύ πιο σπαρακτικό λόγο: Τα λείψανα του 20 μηνών μωρού του είχαν βρεθεί σε ένα δάσος κοντά στο σπίτι του στο Νιου Τζέρσεϊ, αφού ο πιλότος είχε καταβάλει λύτρα 50.000 δολαρίων.

Μια αναχρονιστική δουλειά
Κανείς δεν αμφισβήτησε την ετυμηγορία που έκρινε τον Χόπτμαν ένοχο, αλλά ο ίδιος άσκησε έφεση με το σκεπτικό ότι το τσίρκο των μέσων ενημέρωσης που τον περιέβαλε του είχε στερήσει το δικαίωμα σε μια δίκαιη δίκη.
Η έφεσή του ήταν ανεπιτυχής, αλλά παρακίνησε τον Αμερικανικό Δικηγορικό Σύλλογο να απαγορεύσει την πρόσβαση καμερών στις αίθουσες δικαστηρίων. Αυτός ο κανόνας είναι έκτοτε αμφιλεγόμενος και η απαγόρευση εφαρμόζεται άνισα σε διάφορες πολιτείες της χώρας.
Η απαγόρευση των καμερών έχει επίσης συζητηθεί επανειλημμένα σε υποθέσεις που αφορούν το τσίρκο των μέσων ενημέρωσης, όπως η δίκη του Ο Τζέι Σίμπσον και, πιο πρόσφατα, η αγωγή της Γκουίνεθ Πάλτροου.
Η Νέα Υόρκη, ωστόσο, δεν κατήργησε ποτέ την απαγόρευση- πέρα από το ερώτημα αν είναι περισσότερο ή λιγότερο επίκαιρη στην εποχή της παγκόσμιας μιντιακής φρενίτιδας, αυτό σημαίνει ότι άνθρωποι όπως η Τζέιν Ρόζενμπεργκ έχουν μια από τις πιο ιδιόμορφες -και ίσως αναχρονιστικές- δουλειές στον κόσμο: Σκιτσογράφος δικαστηρίου.
Η viral στιγμή της
Σε μια συνομιλία στο Zoom από το σπίτι της στο Μπρούκλιν, η Ρόζενμπεργκ εξηγεί ότι από τότε που άρχισε να εργάζεται ως σκιτσογράφος σε δικαστικές αίθουσες το 1980, ο κόσμος έλεγε ότι η δουλειά της θα εξαφανιστεί.
Παρά την πανταχού παρουσία της φωτογραφίας και του βίντεο, ή ίσως εξαιτίας της, η Νεοϋορκέζα (η οποία δεν έχει λογαριασμούς στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης) βιώνει μια μικρή αλλά εξαιρετική στιγμή viral φήμης.
Ο λόγος είναι το πορτρέτο που έφτιαξε στον Ντόναλντ Τραμπ κατά την απαγγελία κατηγορίας του στις 4 Απριλίου νωρίτερα φέτος. Μετά την έκρηξη των μέσων ενημέρωσης, το σκίτσο της έγινε το πρώτο του είδους του που κοσμεί το εξώφυλλο του New Yorker.
«Έκανα δύο σκίτσα εκείνη την ημέρα. Στο πρώτο, ο Ντόναλντ Τραμπ απλώς καθόταν εκεί χωρίς πραγματική έκφραση. Και την επόμενη φορά που τον σκιτσάρισα, μόλις είχε δηλώσει αθώος. Έτσι, σκέφτηκα, ω, πρέπει να το αποτυπώσω αυτό: Να μιλάει στο μικρόφωνο. Αλλά όταν έφτασα στο χαρτί μου, είχε γυρίσει και κοίταξε επίμονα τον εισαγγελέα. Και τον έβλεπα με αυτή την έκφραση. Έτσι, σκέφτηκα, ω, πρέπει να το καταγράψω αυτό» εξηγεί.
Ζωγράφισε τον δολοφόνο του Τζον Λένον
Το 1981, όταν η Ρόζενμπεργκ ξεκινούσε για πρώτη φορά την καριέρα της, ζωγράφισε τον δολοφόνο του Τζον Λένον.
«Η πρώτη μεγάλη υπόθεση που θυμάμαι ήταν όταν ο Μαρκ Ντέιβιντ Τσάπμαν πυροβόλησε τον Τζον Λένον… Και θυμάμαι να πηγαίνω στο δικαστήριο, να κοιτάζω τον δικηγόρο του και σκέφτηκα, πώς μπορεί αυτός ο δικηγόρος να εκπροσωπεί αυτόν τον τύπο; Και τώρα είμαι παντρεμένη με δικηγόρο υπεράσπισης και καταλαβαίνω πώς λειτουργεί το σύστημα, ότι όλοι έχουν δικαίωμα σε υπεράσπιση».
Στη συνέχεια, το 1993, κάλυψε τη δίκη για την επιμέλεια των παιδιών του Γούντι Άλεν και της Μία Φάρου. «Ήταν πολύ πριν από το MeToo. Σε εκείνη τη δίκη δεν κρίθηκε ένοχος για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση. Αφορούσε την επιμέλεια, ποιος είναι καλύτερος γονέας για να μεγαλώσει αυτά τα παιδιά… Και δεν γνώριζε κανέναν από τους παιδικούς σταθμούς των παιδιών, δεν γνώριζε κανέναν από τους γιατρούς τους. Έτσι, έχασε την επιμέλεια. Δεν κέρδισε τη μάχη για την κηδεμονία» θυμάται με σοβαρότητα.
Το σκίτσο της είναι ανεπηρέαστο
Εξηγεί ότι εργάζεται για να αντικατοπτρίζει την πραγματικότητα των όσων συμβαίνουν στο δικαστήριο. «Η δουλειά μου είναι να δείχνω ακριβώς τι συμβαίνει. Η γνώμη μου δεν έχει καμία σχέση με το σκίτσο μου. Αν κάποιος κλαίει ή κάποιος γελάει, αν πετάγεται από τη θέση του, πρέπει να αποτυπώσω αυτή τη στιγμή, ό,τι κι αν είναι- είναι εν μέρει δημοσιογραφία. Αυτή είναι η δουλειά μου» δηλώνει.
Ένα άλλο από τα viral σκίτσα της είναι από τη δίκη της Γκισλέιν Μάξγουελ το 2021.
Η Μάξγουελ, το δεξί χέρι του Τζέφρι Επστάιν στο κύκλωμα εμπορίας παιδιών, ανέλαβε να ζωγραφίσει η ίδια τη Ρόζενμπεργκ και η Ρόζενμπεργκ σχεδίασε ένα μετα-σκίτσο. Η ίδια λέει ότι δεν ήταν η πρώτη φορά: Αυτό συνέβη και με τον Έντι Μέρφι, ο οποίος τη ζωγράφισε να τον ζωγραφίζει.
Θυμάται επίσης τη εντυπωσιακή ασφάλεια στην υπόθεση του 2019 κατά του Μεξικανού εμπόρου ναρκωτικών Χοακίν –Ελ Τσάπο- Γκουσμάν, η οποία την έκανε να κολλήσει σε ένα ταξί πριν καν διασχίσει τη γέφυρα του Μπρούκλιν.
Πώς έφτασε να κάνει αυτό το ασυνήθιστο επάγγελμα;
Σχετικά με τις πιο αρνητικές αντιδράσεις σε κάποια πορτρέτα της -όπως όταν οι οπαδοί του Τομ Μπρέιντι διαμαρτυρήθηκαν για το πόσο άχαρα τον είχε απεικονίσει- η Ρόζενμπεργκ παρατηρεί ότι «τις διασημότητες είναι λίγο πιο δύσκολο να τις ζωγραφίσεις. Πρέπει πραγματικά να πετύχεις την ομοιότητά τους, επειδή όλοι νομίζουν ότι ξέρουν πώς είναι από τις ταινίες, αλλά σε μια αίθουσα δικαστηρίου έχουν διαφορετικό φωτισμό. Κάθονται εκεί σε φωτισμό φθορισμού χωρίς μακιγιάζ ή οτιδήποτε άλλο» λέει.
Η Ρόζενμπεργκ κατέληξε σε αυτό το ασυνήθιστο επάγγελμα όταν συνειδητοποίησε ότι το να κάνει πορτραίτα αξίας 1 δολαρίου σε τουριστικές περιοχές στο Κέιπ Κοντ της Μασαχουσέτης δεν ήταν τρόπος να βγάλει τα προς το ζην.
«Μετά το κολλέγιο, ήμουν μια καλλιτέχνις που πάλευε. Έκανα ό,τι μπορούσα για να βγάλω λεφτά και να κερδίσω τα προς το ζην. Ήταν πολύ δύσκολο. Και τότε είδα μια διάλεξη από έναν άλλο καλλιτέχνη δικαστηρίου στο Society of Illustrators…
»Ποτέ δεν σκέφτηκα να είμαι σε δικαστήριο. Όταν είδα αυτή τη διάλεξη, σκέφτηκα, ω, αυτό μοιάζει με κάτι που θα ήθελα πολύ να κάνω, αλλά δεν ξέρω αν είμαι αρκετά καλός. Και μετά είχα φίλους δικηγόρους που με πήγαν στο δικαστήριο και τους έκανα ένα εκατομμύριο ερωτήσεις όπως, πού καθόταν ο καλλιτέχνης; Τι έφεραν; Μου είπαν, έλα την επόμενη εβδομάδα- θα σε αφήσουμε να καθίσεις με τα μέσα ενημέρωσης.
»Έτσι, πήγα και κάθισα στο έδρανο των ενόρκων. Υπήρχαν άλλοι δύο καλλιτέχνες. Έκανα το σκίτσο μου και σκέφτηκα ότι πρέπει πραγματικά να το δοκιμάσω. Το NBC κατέληξε να χρησιμοποιήσει το σκίτσο μου, γυρίζοντάς το σε φιλμ. Και γύρισα σπίτι και το παρακολούθησα στη μικρή ασπρόμαυρη τηλεόρασή μου στο σαλόνι μου. Και τηλεφώνησα στους γονείς μου» θυμάται.
Μέσα ενημέρωσης και δικαιοσύνη
Στα 43 χρόνια των δημοσιογραφικών σκίτσων στα δικαστήρια, η Ρόζενμπεργκ υπήρξε μάρτυρας της εξέλιξης δύο πυλώνων της δημοκρατίας: Των μέσων ενημέρωσης και της δικαιοσύνης.
Είναι πιο αισιόδοξη για το δεύτερο παρά για το πρώτο. «Φαίνεται ότι υπάρχουν θέματα. Στις δεκαετίες που ασχολούμαι με την τέχνη των δικαστικών αιθουσών, επί 43 χρόνια, υπάρχουν υποθέσεις μαφίας για μεγάλο χρονικό διάστημα.
»Υπήρχαν πολλές υποθέσεις τρομοκρατίας. Για μεγάλο χρονικό διάστημα, υπήρχαν επιχειρήσεις, ο Μπέρναντ Μάντοφ και όλα αυτά. Και τώρα φαίνεται να υπάρχει ένα θέμα MeToo. Φαίνεται ότι πολλές από τις υποθέσεις που κάνω είναι MeToo.
»Πάντα υπήρχαν υποθέσεις αστυνομικής βίας από την αρχή μέχρι σήμερα. Και δεν υπήρχαν κινητά τηλέφωνα όταν ξεκίνησα. Έτσι, στην πρώτη υπόθεση αστυνομικής βίας, δεν υπήρχε βίντεο, όπως στην υπόθεση του Τζορτζ Φλόιντ. Και νομίζω ότι οι ένορκοι έκαναν πάντα το σωστό» λέει.
Πώς τα βλέπει τα πράγματα;
«Δεν αισθάνομαι ότι υπήρξε εξέλιξη του συστήματος δικαιοσύνης. Αισθάνομαι ενδεχομένως ότι υπήρξε εξέλιξη των μέσων ενημέρωσης, για τα οποία εργάζομαι. Όταν ξεκίνησα, υπήρχαν μόνο τρεις μεγάλοι τηλεοπτικοί σταθμοί και οι ειδήσεις ήταν μόνο στις έξι και επτά.
»Και στη συνέχεια ήταν στις πέντε, έξι και επτά. Μετά υπήρχε μια μεσημεριανή εκπομπή. Έτσι, οι προθεσμίες μου γίνονταν όλο και πιο γρήγορες. Τώρα, είναι 24 ώρες το 24ωρο. Τώρα πρέπει να βγάζω τα σκετς μου εκεί έξω όσο πιο γρήγορα μπορώ. Με περιμένουν. Βγάλτε το τώρα. Αυτό είναι λοιπόν που εξελίχθηκε» λέει η Ρόζενμπεργκ.
Στο αποκορύφωμα της πανδημίας του Covid-19, η σκιτσογράφος έπρεπε επίσης να κάνει τα πορτρέτα της μέσω τηλεδιάσκεψης (για παράδειγμα, έκανε σκίτσα για τις δίκες των ταραξιών στο Καπιτώλιο) και συνέχισε ακόμη και να κάνει πορτρέτα κατηγορουμένων και μαρτύρων φορώντας τις μάσκες του προσώπου τους.
Τα υπαρκτά εμπόδια
Αναφέρει τις δυσκολίες που αντιμετώπισε στην υπόθεση της δημοσιογράφου Τζιν Κάρολ – η οποία κατηγόρησε τον Ντόναλντ Τραμπ ότι τη βίασε – ως αποτέλεσμα του αριθμού των υπολογιστών και των οθονών που της εμπόδιζαν τη θέα του ενάγοντος.
Είναι αγχωτικό; «Είναι πιο αγχωτικό να ξεκινάς από την πρώτη ημέρα της υπόθεσης. Ποτέ δεν ξέρω τι πρόκειται να αντιμετωπίσω. Δεν ξέρω πού θα καθίσω. Οι δίκες είναι διαφορετικές από τις προσαγωγές ή τις ακροάσεις. Είναι τόσο γρήγορες… Αλλά μια δίκη παίρνει πραγματικά χρόνο για να συμβεί κάτι» εξηγεί.
Μαλακώνει όταν κάνει έναν απολογισμό του τι σημαίνει η καριέρα της γι’ αυτήν: «Αγαπώ τη δουλειά μου. Αισθάνομαι ότι προσφέρω δημόσια υπηρεσία. Και παρόλο που δεν έχω πολύ χρόνο για την προσωπική μου ζωή, εξακολουθεί να είναι συναρπαστικό για μένα να παρακολουθώ μια δίκη.
»Νιώθω ότι σχεδόν κάθε μέρα κάθομαι μπροστά σε μια εκπομπή με κάποιο τρόπο».
Ωστόσο, επιστρέφοντας στο αρχικό σημείο, υποστηρίζει ότι, με ή χωρίς αυτήν, η εκπομπή πρέπει να προστατευτεί από τη σόουμπιζ. «Νομίζω ότι η αίθουσα του δικαστηρίου είναι ένας ιερός χώρος. Δεν νομίζω ότι πρέπει να μετατρέπεται σε ψυχαγωγία. Νομίζω ότι πολλοί άνθρωποι φοβούνται να βρεθούν μπροστά στην κάμερα. Οι μάρτυρες μπορεί να είναι φοβισμένοι. Οι δικηγόροι μπορεί να παίζουν στις κάμερες. Υπάρχει μεγάλη δύναμη σε ένα δωμάτιο μοντάζ για το τι βγαίνει στην τηλεόραση».

"Jane Rosenberg, la retratista de los juicios y autora de una histórica portada para ‘The New Yorker’","En 1935 se vivía en Estados Unidos el juicio del llamado “crimen del siglo”. Bruno Hauptmann estaba acusado de haber secuestrado y asesinado al hijo del famoso piloto Charles Lindbergh. El caso fue registrado por más de 120 cámaras dentro de la sala. Lindbergh, toda una gloria nacional estadounidense al ser considerado el primero en cruzar de Nueva York a París en su avión en 1927, tenía entonces al país con un corazón en un puño por una razón mucho más desgarradora: los restos de su bebé de apenas 20 meses habían sido encontrados en un bosque cercano a su casa de Nueva Jersey, después de haber pagado 50.000 dólares de la época por su rescate. Nadie cuestionó el veredicto que halló culpable a Hauptmann, pero este recurrió la sentencia amparándose en que el circo mediático le había negado el derecho a un juicio justo. Su apelación no llegó a buen puerto, pero sí impulsó que la Asociación de Abogados de Estados Unidos vetara el acceso de las cámaras a los tribunales. Esta ha sido desde entonces una regla polémica, que ha entrado y salido de manera desigual en los diferentes Estados del país y que se ha vuelto a comentar a propósito de casos mediáticos como el de O. J. Simpson o, más recientemente, el de Gwyneth Paltrow. En Nueva York, sin embargo, esta prohibición nunca llegó a desactivarse y, al margen del planteamiento sobre si es más o menos relevante en la era del circo mediático global, hace que algunas personas como Jane Rosenberg tengan uno de los oficios más peculiares y quizá anacrónicos del mundo: retratista de juzgado.
“Desde que empecé este trabajo en 1980, siempre se ha dicho que estábamos a punto de desaparecer”, explica Rosenberg desde su casa en Brooklyn, en una conversación vía Zoom. A pesar de la ubicuidad de la fotografía y el vídeo, o precisamente por eso, esta neoyorquina que no tiene redes sociales vive un pequeño y extraordinario momento de fama viral. El “culpable” es el retrato de Donald Trump en plena instrucción de cargos el día 4 de abril de este año. Tras la explosión mediática, su viñeta se convirtió en la primera de este tipo en copar una portada de The New Yorker. “Ese día había hecho dos esbozos. En el primero, Donald Trump estaba sentado, sin expresión, y en el otro estaba declarándose no culpable, hablando en el micrófono. Pero luego se dio la vuelta y miró encendido al fiscal y me di cuenta de que ese era el gesto que resumía el momento, que era eso lo que tenía que capturar”, describe.
Casi al principio de su carrera, en 1981, le tocó dibujar al asesino de John Lennon. “Fue mi primer gran caso, el de Mark David Chapman. Llevaba dos meses en el trabajo y mi reacción fue odiar al abogado defensor, me preguntaba cómo podía representar a alguien así. Pero ahora estoy casada con un abogado defensor y entiendo cómo funciona el sistema. Todo el mundo tiene derecho a una defensa”. Unos años más tarde, en 1993, cubrió el juicio por la custodia de los hijos de Woody Allen y Mia Farrow. “Fue mucho antes del MeToo y hubo alguna mención a los abusos, pero lo que se dirimía era quién era mejor padre, y Woody no sabía nada de los amigos de juegos de sus hijos ni los nombres de sus médicos, así que perdió la custodia”, recuerda, siempre factual, nada mitómana y tirando a desapasionada. “Mis opiniones no entran en mis dibujos. Soy periodista, es mi trabajo”, sentencia. “Ya me había pasado con Eddie Murphy antes”, dice cuando se le menta otro de sus momentos virales: cuando Ghislaine Maxwell, la mano derecha de Jeffrey Epstein en su trama de tráfico de menores, se dedicó durante su juicio en 2021 a dibujar a la propia Rosenberg y ella le hizo una metacaricatura. También recuerda el espectacular despliegue de seguridad en 2019 para el caso contra el narcotraficante mexicano Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán, que le hizo quedarse atascada en un taxi antes de cruzar el puente de Brooklyn. Y sobre reacciones más agrias a algunos de sus retratos —como cuando los fans de Tom Bra­dy protestaron por lo poco agraciado que lo había sacado— reflexiona: “Los famosos son difíciles de retratar, porque todo el mundo piensa que los conocen por las películas o las cámaras de televisión. En los tribunales hay otra luz, llevan otro maquillaje o no llevan”, atestigua.
Rosenberg llegó a esta peculiar profesión tras darse cuenta de que vivir a dólar por retrato en las zonas más turísticas de Cape Cod, en Massa­chusetts, no era una manera de hacer carrera. “Era una artista luchando por su propia supervivencia cuando fui a una charla de una retratista de juzgado. Pensé que era algo que me gustaría hacer, aunque no sabía si se me daría bien. Pero tenía varios amigos abogados que me llevaron a los tribunales. Hice miles de preguntas a los funcionarios del juzgado: dónde se sienta el artista, qué materiales traen…, hasta que me dejaron entrar al estrado del jurado, compartiendo espacio con otros dos artistas, hice un bosquejo… y me gustó cómo quedó. En 1980 la NBC hizo una pieza en la que incluyó mis dibujos. Lo vi en mi televisión pequeña en blanco y negro y llamé a mis padres”, recuerda.
En 43 años de retrato-periodismo judicial, Rosenberg se ha convertido en una testigo de excepción de la evolución de dos de los pilares de la democracia: los medios y la justicia. Es más optimista con lo segundo que con lo primero. “Es difícil trazar una evolución de la justicia. Hubo un tiempo en el que había muchos juicios sobre mafia, otra época en la que hubo más casos de terrorismo, otras de delito financiero, con Bernie Madoff y demás, y ahora hay mucho del MeToo. Lo que ha estado ahí desde el principio ha sido la brutalidad policial. No había teléfonos móviles cuando empecé y ahora es muy distinto, porque hay vídeos como en el caso de George ­Floyd. Pero sí puedo decir que el jurado suele acertar”, declara. “Pero sí ha habido una evolución clara de los medios de comunicación para los que trabajo: cuando empecé había tres grandes cadenas. Las noticias eran a las seis y a las siete de la tarde. Luego empezaron a ser a las cinco, a las seis y a las siete, luego al mediodía… Así que las entregas comenzaron a ser más y más ajustadas. Ahora es las 24 horas del día los siete días de la semana, así que siempre me están atosigando con que quieren el retrato para ya. Siento que trabajo más que nunca, es una locura”, asegura quien, además, tuvo que arreglárselas durante la parte más dura de la pandemia para hacer los retratos por videoconferencia (en concreto, los de los juicios sobre el asalto al Capitolio) e incluso seguir haciendo retratos a acusados y testigos con mascarilla.
Días antes de esta conversación acababa de presenciar la instrucción de cargos contra Daniel Penny, el marine que causó la muerte de un joven afroamericano en el metro de Nueva York, y habla de las dificultades que ha sufrido con el caso de la periodista E. Jean Carroll —que acusó a Donald Trump de haberla violado— debido a la cantidad de ordenadores y pantallas que bloqueaban su visión de la demandante. “Todavía me pongo nerviosa el primer día con un nuevo caso. No sé lo que me voy a encontrar, dónde me van a sentar, si voy a tener buena o mala visibilidad. Cada día es un reto distinto. No es lo mismo un juicio de meses que una audiencia breve”, explica. Solo se ablanda cuando hace balance de lo que significa su carrera para ella: “Me encanta mi trabajo. Siento que hago un servicio público. Y aunque no tengo mucho tiempo para mi vida personal, para mí sigue siendo fascinante ver un juicio. Siento que casi cada día estoy sentada frente a un espectáculo de alguna manera”. Un espectáculo, no obstante, que, volviendo al punto inicial, defiende que siga, con o sin ella, protegiéndose de las reglas del show business. “La sala del juzgado es un lugar sagrado. No creo que deba convertirse en un lugar de entretenimiento, que es en lo que se convertiría con las televisiones. Los testigos se podrían sentir intimidados, los abogados quizá actuarían más ante las cámaras y el montaje de las imágenes tiene demasiado poder”.",2023-07-19T03:40:00Z,https://elpais.com,El País
Super agent at centre of payments scandal who calls clients 'the family' described as being 'bigger than RTE',"SUPER agent Noel Kelly was today described as being “bigger than RTE”.
Politicians told of their concerns over the influence of agents, including Ryan Tubridy trusted manager at the Oireachtas Media Committee hearing today.

3 Senator Shane Cassells asked whether there was evidence that other media outlets were willing to pay Tubridy more than €500k
And in response to questions, RTE executives accepted that they often pay larger salaries than elsewhere in the industry.
Fianna Fail Senator Shane Cassells asked Interim Deputy Director General Adrian Lynch how execs allowed “one man and his agent to become bigger than RTÉ”.
And he asked whether there was evidence that other media outlets were willing to pay Tubs more than €500,000. Mr Lynch was unable to provide any.
Insiders say RTE and their stars have become reliant on Mr Kelly who helped transform their earnings.
A source explained: “Noel can deliver sponsors for RTE ­programmes.”
Another told us: “RTE stars had a hard time getting decent money before Noel came on the scene. Celebrity has never been valued in this country.
“Remember Gay Byrne was on a rolling 13-week contract for over 20 years at RTE before he threatened to walk and finally got paid his worth.”
Mr Kelly refers to his clients as “the family”.
He also has Pat Kenny, Claire Byrne, Joe Duffy and Dermot Bannon Kathryn Thomas as clients. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on their parts.
And he’s reached such popularity, he can choose clients.
A source added: “There’s a 100 more people who’d like Noel as their agent but he’s picky who he takes on.”
Asked it was appropriate for a host to interview a client also repped by their agent, Mr Lynch said this should be clearly stated if it happens.
OUT OF CONTRACT
This comes as Ryan Tubridy's RTE future is up in the air after the national broadcaster revealed he is out of contract.
Having left the Late Late Show last month, the highest-earning presenter's latest contract - which was negotiated back in 2020 - had come to an end.

Mulher de 50 anos investe R$ 73 mil em cirurgia plástica para 'voltar aos 30',"A norte-americana Kelly Beasley, de 50 anos, viralizou nas redes sociais após compartilhar o desejo de realizar procedimentos estéticos para “voltar aos 30”. O resultado, no entanto, dividiu opiniões de internautas, que, inclusive, disseram que a mulher não teve o efeito esperado.
Pelas redes sociais, a mulher contou que seu sonho de uma pele facial sem rugas e linhas de expressão que apareciam em seu rosto.
Para a realização do procedimento, Beasley viajou até a cidade de Tijuana (México), na fronteira com San Diego (Califórnia, EUA) e revela que desembolsou cerca de US$ 14,8 mil (o equivalente a R$ 73 mil) em um lifting — tipo de cirurgia cujo objetivo é retardar o envelhecimento. A recuperação, segundo ela, durou cerca de quatro meses.
No TikTok, Kelly compartilhou um vídeo mostrando todo processo de recuperação, além de exibiu o resultado da cirurgia. A publicação já atingiu mais de 700 mil visualizações.
""Aqui está a minha versão 2.0. Estou vivendo a minha melhor forma agora. Se você quiser, vá em frente. Não tenha vergonha"", afirmou ela.
Porém, algumas pessoas contrariam a mulher: ""Eu não consigo ver muita diferença"", disse uma internauta. Outra ainda afirmou: ''Linda, mas não tem 33 anos, eu é que tenho''. As críticas, no entanto, foram rebatidas por outros seguidores: ""Alguém notou que as pessoas que sempre têm algo negativo a dizer literalmente não têm absolutamente nenhuma foto de si mesmas nas redes sociais"", defendeu uma seguidora.

THE BIG STORY: Feds Move to Seize R. Kelly’s Royalty Funds
In the wake of criminal convictions that will see him spend decades in prison, R. Kelly is also facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and restitution payments. Last week, the feds told his record label and music publisher to help him pay up.
Prosecutors in Brooklyn asked a federal judge for so-called writs of garnishment against Sony Music and Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) — court orders that would compel the two companies to hand over funds tied to Kelly. The two companies are “in possession of property” belonging to Kelly, the filing said, that could be used to pay down the $504,289 he owes to victims and the government.
It’s unclear how much Sony Music and UMPG are holding in Kelly-tied money, but the feds aren’t the only ones trying to get at it.
R. Kelly victim Heather Williams, who won a $4 million civil judgment against the singer, is also seeking to tap into the Sony Music account — as is Midwest Commercial Funding, a property management company that won a separate $3.5 million ruling against Kelly over unpaid rent at a Chicago studio.
In March, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that Williams had priority to the funds over Midwest Commercial Funding because she was the first to properly demand the money from Sony. But that ruling left unclear whether she’ll enjoy similar priority over federal prosecutors.

After a whirlwind week of litigation, Adidas abruptly dropped a federal court case aimed at freezing $75 million held by Kanye West’s Yeezy brand.

Timbaland Says R. Kelly Is Still the 'King of R&B',"Timbaland said R. Kelly is still the ""king of R&B"" and ""we all know that"" during a podcast appearance.
""His art is his art, I ain't gonna bash the man's art,"" the award-winning producer added.
Kelly, 56, is currently in prison after being convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking charges.

Timbaland insisted that R. Kelly is still the R&B G.O.A.T., despite his being convicted of sex-trafficking women.
""R. Kelly's the king of R&B. We all know that, man,"" the award-winning music producer said during a recent appearance on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast while discussing with host Shannon Sharpe whether it's possible to separate Kelly's art from his crimes.
In June 2022, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a New York Court after being found guilty on nine counts of racketeering and sex-trafficking charges related to Kelly's decades-long practice of grooming women and girls for illegal sex.
In February of this year, the 56-year-old was then sentenced by a Chicago court to an additional 20 years in prison after being found guilty of producing child pornography and abusing minors.
Kelly will serve 19 years of his Chicago sentence concurrently with his New York sentence, meaning that Kelly could serve a total of 31 years in prison.
""Everybody jump when you say R. Kelly,"" Timbaland said. ""I'm like, so we just gonna ignore his music that he gave us, that we all jam to?""
""No, we can't do that. His art is his art, I ain't gonna bash the man's art,"" he added. ""Don't mix music up with personal. Music is a feeling, it stands alone. Music is something that don't have no race, it brings people together. It don't have no drama with it. It is a place of enjoyment; a feeling, so don't bring drama into music. Leave that outside.""
Representatives for Timbaland did not immediately reply to Insider's request for comment.
Though Timbaland never worked with Kelly, he did produce numerous songs, including ""One in a Million"" and ""Try Again,"" for the late Aaliyah, who married Kelly in 1994 when she was 15 and he was 27.
During an episode of ""True Hollywood Story"" in 2011, Timbaland confessed to being ""in love"" with Aaliyah when they first met in 1995.
He said he did not act on his feelings because of their seven-year age difference.
""She just a baby, I'm old,"" he said. ""I said to myself, 'I'm just gonna be her brother.' Oh man, I was fightin', I was fightin' a lot, a big war. But I loved Aaliyah.""",2023-05-25T04:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Minnesota prosecutors drop charges against R. Kelly,"A courtroom sketch shows defense attorneys Ashley Cohen, from left, and Jennifer Bonjean with singer R. Kelly at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago on Sept. 14, 2022. (Cheryl Cook / Chicago Tribune)
Prosecutors in Minnesota have decided to drop sex charges against R. Kelly, noting that the disgraced R&B singer has already been sentenced to decades behind bars on two separate federal convictions.
“The overwhelming impact of proceeding to trial in this case on the survivor victim, the community and the Hennepin County legal system would be enormous while a conviction would not add any additional time in prison,” the Hennepin County attorney’s office stated this week.

The Minnesota case was the final pending criminal case against Kelly, who was charged with sex offenses in multiple jurisdictions across the country in 2019. He was found guilty of racketeering by a federal jury in New York in 2021. Last year, he was convicted in Chicago’s federal court on charges of child pornography and sexual conduct with minors. Appeals of the federal convictions are pending.
Earlier this year, Cook County prosecutors dropped their four pending cases against Kelly. State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said the office believed strongly that the accusations against Kelly were credible but that the office’s resources would be better spent elsewhere, given that Kelly likely will spend the rest of his life in prison.

The Minnesota charges, brought in August 2019, alleged Kelly solicited a teenage girl who asked him for his autograph in 2001. She approached Kelly at an event in downtown Minneapolis and asked him to sign an autograph for her, prosecutors said at the time.
Kelly also gave her his phone number, and she later went to his hotel suite. He paid her $200 to take off her clothes and dance for him, and the two had some sexual contact, prosecutors said.
In a statement Tuesday, Hennepin County prosecutors said they “continue to believe the victim survivor as to what Mr. Kelly did to her in this case” and believe that Kelly would be convicted if the case went to trial. But that conviction would not add to Kelly’s time in prison, the statement noted.
Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said Wednesday that she was pleased with the decision to drop the charges.
“It was the right thing to do for a number of reasons,” said Bonjean. “It would have been an enormous waste of resources for the state of Minnesota.”
Bonjean said that while they were happy to not have to defend Kelly against the allegations, his team was “absolutely ready” to go to trial and likely would have prevailed.
“We would have defended that case,” she said. “I don’t think the evidence would have shaken out the way they thought it would.”
Meanwhile, attorney Gloria Allred issued a statement on behalf of the alleged victim in the case, identified only as Jane Doe. It said what Kelly did to her has been weighing heavily on her for more than 20 years and would continue to hurt her for the rest of her life.

“As a surviving victim of R. Kelly, I feel sad about the fact that Hennepin County attorney’s office in Minnesota decided not to hold him accountable for what he did to me when I was a minor,” the statement said. “If there had been a criminal trial, I would have been willing to testify against R. Kelly. Even though it wouldn’t have brought any extra prison time for him, it would have given me closure.”
Kelly, a Chicago native, got his start busking in subway stations before rocketing to fame with hits such as “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Ignition: Remix.”
Allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers dogged him for years, and were first reported by the Chicago Sun-Times more than two decades ago.
Cook County prosecutors in 2002 charged him with child pornography, alleging he filmed himself having sex with his 14-year-old goddaughter. He was acquitted six years later after a bombastic trial during which the victim never testified.
In the years after that, he enjoyed something of a career renaissance, playing the Pitchfork Music Festival in his hometown in 2013 and collaborating with artists such as Lady Gaga and Mariah Carey.
But controversy continued to swirl around him, and came to a head a few years later driven largely by investigative stories by music critic and reporter Jim DeRogatis in BuzzFeed and The New Yorker, as well as damning accusations in the blockbuster Lifetime documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.”

After the documentary aired in January 2019, Foxx held an unusual news conference, saying she was “sickened” by the allegations and putting out a public plea for Kelly’s accusers to come forward.

The Cook County indictments were announced about a month later, and the federal indictments were brought down later that year. The Minnesota case followed about a month afterward.
A federal jury in Brooklyn convicted Kelly in 2021 on racketeering conspiracy charges alleging his musical career doubled as a criminal enterprise aimed at satisfying his predatory sexual desires. That case resulted in the 30-year sentence.
The latest conviction came in September in Chicago’s federal courthouse, where Kelly was found guilty of abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter on videotape in the 1990s, as well as sexual misconduct with two other minors around the same time period. The same jury acquitted Kelly on charges that he rigged his 2008 trial.
Kelly was sentenced to 20 years in prison on that conviction, though U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber ordered that only one year will be served consecutive to his 30-year sentence in New York.

"Minnesota prosecutors drop state sex abuse charges against R. Kelly, citing federal convictions","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota prosecutors have dropped sex abuse charges against disgraced R&B superstar R. Kelly that alleged he invited a 17-year-old girl to his hotel room in 2001 and paid her $200 to dance naked with him.
The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office said in a statement Tuesday that it believes her and that Kelly would likely be convicted if tried, but prosecuting him on charges that had been dormant since being filed in 2019 wouldn’t make a difference now that Kelly’s federal convictions could keep him in prison for the rest of his life.
“The overwhelming impact of proceeding to trial in this case on the survivor victim, the community, and the Hennepin County legal system would be enormous while a conviction would not add any additional time in prison,” the statement said.
The woman Kelly allegedly abused in Minnesota wanted to testify at a trial anyway, her lawyer said.
Attorney Gloria Allred issued a statement on behalf of the woman, identified only as Jane Doe. It said what Kelly did to her has been weighing heavily on her for more than 20 years and would continue to hurt her for the rest of her life.
“As a surviving victim of R. Kelly, I feel sad about the fact that Hennepin County Attorney’s Office in Minnesota decided not to hold him accountable for what he did to me when I was a minor,” the statement said. “If there had been a criminal trial, I would have been willing to testify against R. Kelly. Even though it wouldn’t have brought any extra prison time for him, it would have given me closure.”
Federal juries in Chicago and New York convicted Kelly, now 56, of crimes including child pornography, enticement, racketeering and sex trafficking related to allegations that he victimized women and girls. Born Robert Sylvester Kelly, he was sentenced to 30 years in the New York case last year and a mostly concurrent 20 years in February in the Chicago case.
The woman in Minnesota sued Kelly in 2021, but that case remans dormant, too, because Kelly is in prison and is unable to defend himself, cord records show. He was transferred to a federal prison in North Carolina last month.
The Grammy-winning Kelly rose from poverty in Chicago to become one of the world’s biggest R&B stars. Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” he sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.
When he announced the Minnesota charges in 2019, then-County Attorney Mike Freeman said Kelly met the young woman before a concert in Minneapolis when she tried to get his autograph. Freeman said the performer gave her his signature and a phone number, and when she called it, she was invited to Kelly’s hotel room. She was offered $200 to take off her clothes and dance, and Kelly took his clothes off as well and they danced together, Freeman said.
The criminal complaint said she told investigators that Kelly lay on his bed and she climbed on top of him “body to body.” He allegedly touched her all over her body and fondled himself.
Cook County prosecutors in Chicago dropped state sex abuse charges there in January, citing his lengthy federal prison sentences.

Trump taunts DeSantis over Craft’s loss in Kentucky GOP race: ‘Ron’s magic is GONE!’,"Former President Trump took a victory lap on Wednesday, taunting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) after two of the governor’s endorsees lost their races on Tuesday night.
Trump endorsed state Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R), who beat out DeSantis-backed candidate former U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft in the Kentucky GOP gubernatorial primary. Cameron placed first, Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles placed second and Craft placed third.
DeSantis also backed Republican candidate Daniel Davis in the Jacksonville, Fla. mayoral race, who lost to Democrat Donna Deegan.
“Congratulations to a ‘star’ in Kentucky, Danial Cameron, who easily won the Republican Nomination for Governor. He had my Complete and Total Endorsement,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
“The DeSanctimonious backed candidate came in a DISTANT third. Ron’s magic is GONE! He also lost, shockingly, in Jacksonville last night (Mayor),” he added, using the belittling nickname he’s given DeSantis.
Trump claimed in a separate post that had Davis asked Trump for his endorsement, “he would have won, easily”
“Too proud to do so. Fools! This is a BIG LOSS for the Republican Party. Remember, ‘Rob’ only won because of me!!!” Trump added, referring to his endorsement of DeSantis in 2018
Trump’s remarks come as DeSantis is expected to officially launch a 2024 White House bid in the coming weeks and is seen as the former president’s chief rival for the GOP nomination.

Trump-backed Daniel Cameron wins Kentucky GOP governor’s primary,"State Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R), who’s backed by former President Trump, is projected to win Kentucky’s GOP gubernatorial primary, according to The Associated Press.
Cameron’s toughest opponents in the crowded GOP field were former U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft and Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles. He was widely seen as the front-runner in the race and was aided by Trump’s endorsement in a state that the former president won by double digits in 2020.
The state attorney general garnered national attention in 2020 for a breakout speech at the Republican National Convention.
“I think often about my ancestors who struggled for freedom,” Cameron, who is Black, said at the RNC. “I also think about Joe Biden, who says, ‘If you aren’t voting for me, you ain’t Black,’ who argued that Republicans would put us back in chains, who said there is no diversity of thought in the Black community.”
“Mr. Vice President, look at me. I am Black; we are not all the same, sir. I am not in chains. My mind is my own,” he added.
Cameron now faces Gov. Andy Beshear (D) in November’s general election. But Beshear holds a 63 percent approval rating in the state, meaning unseating the Democrat will be no easy feat.",2023-05-16T23:13:18Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
DeSantis backs Craft in Kentucky governor’s race,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is backing former U.N. ambassador Kelly Craft in the Kentucky GOP gubernatorial primary as voters head to the polls on Tuesday to choose the Republican nominee to take on Gov. Andy Beshear (D).
The Florida governor’s endorsement sets up a proxy war against former President Trump, who has backed another frontrunner in the race, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron.
“You’ve had a woke liberal governor who’s put a radical agenda ahead of Kentuckians. The stakes couldn’t be higher. I know what it takes to stand up for what’s right, and Kelly Craft’s got it. She’s proven it. I’m strongly encouraging you to go out and vote for my friend Kelly Craft,” DeSantis said in an audio ad endorsing Craft.
“Kelly shares the same vision we do in Florida. She will stand up to the left as they try to indoctrinate our children with their woke ideology. Kelly will fight against crazy ESG policies that are trying to end the coal industry in Kentucky, and Kelly’s going to do everything in her power to end the fentanyl crisis that is hurting Kentucky families,” he continued.
Craft, Cameron and Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles are largely seen as the three frontrunners in the crowded field. Craft has generally polled in second place behind Cameron, who is backed by Trump.
But it’s unclear who will benefit the most from the low turnout, with just 10 percent of voters expected to cast votes Tuesday.

Trump-backed candidate widens lead in bruising Kentucky governor primary: poll,"Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R), who’s backed by former President Trump, is widening his lead in the contentious Kentucky GOP gubernatorial primary, according to a new poll.
An Emerson College Polling/Fox 56 Lexington survey released on Sunday found Cameron receiving 33 percent support among Kentucky Republican likely voters, compared to former U.N. Ambassador Kelly Craft at roughly 18 percent and Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles at 13 percent.
Another 13 percent said they were undecided. The polling shows that Cameron’s support grew 3 percent since a similar poll conducted last month, which found the Trump-backed candidate at 30 percent while Craft sat at 24 percent and Quarles was at 15 percent.
The polling comes two days before the Kentucky GOP gubernatorial primary. Cameron has widely been viewed as the frontrunner in the race, though Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams (R) estimated last week that voter turnout may be around 10 percent, posing some uncertainty in the race.
“Cameron has grown his support amongst women, from 29% in April to 36% in the current poll,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in a statement. “Men have shifted away from Craft by 10 points since April, 29% to 19%. [Suspended attorney Eric] Deters has gained 7 points among men this month going from 5% to 12%.”
Whoever wins Tuesday’s primary will go head-to-head against Gov. Andy Beshear (D), who enjoys unusually high approval ratings for a red state Democrat.
The Emerson College Polling/Fox 56 Lexington survey polled 500 very likely Republican primary voters between May 10 and 12. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.",2023-05-15T15:21:04Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
Recension Take a chance Prime Video,"”De skulle nog inte ta till sig några råd, för de skulle inte medge att de är stalkare”, säger Zoe Dronfield i ”Take a chance”, Prime Videos dokumentär om Gert van der Graaf, mannen som stalkade Agnetha Fältskog.
Dronfield – i dokumentären presenteras hon som stalkingexpert och bästsäljande författare – må prata om stalkare som grupp, men avsikten är förstås att tittaren ska tänka på Gert van der Graaf.
Vid ett tillfälle i ”Take a chance” läser regissören Maria Thulin högt från ett förhör med Agnetha Fältskog. Då hävdas att Gert van der Graaf under perioden 1997-1999 ska ha skrivit ”cirka 300 brev till Fältskog”. Han ska även ha ringt hem till Fältskog ”mycket ofta, cirka en till tre gånger per dag” och ”följt efter Fältskog vart hon än tog vägen”.
Enligt förhöret ska Gert van der Graaf också, bland mycket annat, ha ”bevakat platser som Fältskog har besökt”.
Maria Thulin fortsätter läsa: ”Hennes liv har blivit oerhört inskränkt. Hon törs inte röra sig ute utan att ha sin granne med sig”.
En stund senare frågar Thulin om Gert van der Graaf kan förstå, nu när han får höra det här, att Agnetha Fältskog blivit rädd.
Nej, svarar Gert van der Graaf.
Det är det starkaste och mest avslöjande ögonblicket i ”Take a chance”. När kameran slutar att fokusera på Gert van der Graaf, klipps till bland andra Zoe Dronfield, som ger ett slags någorlunda djupare förklaring till Gert van der Graafs stalkning.
""TAKE A CHANCE"" Regi: Maria Thulin. Med: Gert van der Graaf, Fredrik Strage, Rhonda Saunders, Laura Richards, Zoe Dronfield, Lesley-Ann Jones, Staffan Erfors, Leif Schulman, Paul Gambaccini med flera. Premiär: 19 maj på Prime Video. Visa mer
Regissören Maria Thulin och exekutiva producenten Joel Karsberg – han har tidigare bland annat gjort ”Surviving R. Kelly” – har berättat att syftet med ”Take a chance” är att utforska ”farorna när tvångsmässig idoldyrkan övergår till kriminell handling” och att dokumentären ”följer Gerts unika synvinkel och tidslinje”.
Med det lyckas de.
Maria Thulin rör sig varsamt fram när hon berättar om Gert van der Graaf, hans Abba-dyrkan och påstådda förhållande med Agnetha Fältskog. I stället för att nyttja genrens många dramatiska och numera uttjatade knep får van der Graafs egna ord ofta väga tyngst, ett bevis på att Thulin litar på att tittaren kan dra sina egna slutsatser.
Däremot gör dokumentärmakarna vid ett antal tillfällen fel musikval. De av oss som sedan tidigare har läst om Gert van der Graaf vill inte att musiken ska ha ett slags sympatisyfte; vi är intresserade av vad Gert van der Graaf har att säga och inte att tycka synd om honom.
Detta blir ett återkommande störningsmoment.
Nåväl.
Även om ”Take a chance” vigt rör sig framåt – arkivbilderna är många gånger fint valda och iscensättandet av sådant som berättas fungerar överlag – är det omöjligt att bortse från dokumentärens elefant i rummet: ”Agnetha Fältskog har blivit tillfrågad att medverka i dokumentären men har tackat nej.”
När ”Take a chance” är slut sitter tittaren med fler frågor än svar i sitt knä. En av få personer – med stor sannolikhet den enda – som kunde hjälpt oss är Agnetha Fältskog.
Att Abba-stjärnan inte medverkar – detta är naturligtvis hennes fulla rätt – förstör inte balansen i ”Take a chance” då det finns många som ifrågasätter Gert van der Graaf, men gör att dokumentären endast blir en bland flera.
Jag hade förväntat mig mer.",2023-05-11T04:00:00Z,https://www.expressen.se,Expressen
Ted Cruz to stump for Kelly Craft in heated Kentucky GOP primary,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is stumping for Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Kelly Craft ahead of the Republican primary on May 16.
Craft announced on Thursday that Cruz would be joining her at two get out the vote rallies on May 13 in Louisville and Richmond.
“Please join my friend Senator Ted Cruz and me at our get out the vote rallies next weekend! #TeamCraft has the energy and momentum going into May 16 and we would love to see you in Louisville and Richmond,” Craft tweeted.
The development comes as recent polling has shown Craft, who served as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. during the Trump administration, trailing behind state Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R).
An Emerson College Polling/Fox 56 Lexington survey released last month showed Cameron receiving 30 percent support in the GOP gubernatorial primary among very likely Republican primary voters, compared to Craft who received 24 percent. Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles received 15 percent.
Polling from Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy released in January also showed Cameron performing the best of four Republican challengers against Gov. Andy Beshear (D) in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, according to the Louisville Courier Journal. Still, that matchup saw Cameron trailing Beshear at the time at 40 percent to 49 percent.
The GOP primary will be widely watched given that Beshear has unusually high support as a Democrat governing a state that former President Trump won in 2020 by double digits. Despite the fact that Craft served as an ambassador during the Trump administration, the former president has endorsed Cameron in the race.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has not endorsed a candidate in the race, though Cameron is a former aide to the Kentucky Republican.",2023-05-04T13:46:57Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
"R. Kelly Moved To Federal Prison Facility Where The ""Unabomber"" Is Being Held","Photo by Antonio Perez – Pool via Getty Images
R. Kelly has been transferred from a prison in Chicago to a federal prison in North Carolina to serve his sentence on child pornography, racketeering, and sex trafficking conviction, AP reports.
Article continues after video.
Kelly was moved to the federal prison in Butner, North Carolina on April 19, and its medical facility currently houses “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, CNN notes. It was also where Bernie Madoff, the deceased mastermind of a notorious Ponzi scheme, was detained.
Kelly is serving concurrent terms for different cases: a 20-year prison sentence for three counts of production of child pornography and three counts of enticement of a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity and a 30-year sentence on racketeering and sex trafficking charges for forming a “network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.”
The transfer comes after his attorneys moved to appeal his federal racketeering conviction last week.
Kelly has repeatedly asserted his innocence, famously decrying the allegations in an emotionally charged interview with Gayle King in 2019.
“What I was really thinking to myself was: I’m not done with this interview, so I’m going to let him have his moment,” King explained later. “If I stood up even to comfort him, that could have been his invitation to say ‘This is over.’ So I didn’t interrupt his anger and let him have that.”",2023-04-25T20:57:43Z,https://www.essence.com,Essence
R. Kelly transferred to federal prison in North Carolina,"CNN —
Disgraced R&B singer and convicted sex trafficker R. Kelly has been transferred to a federal prison in North Carolina.
R. Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was moved to FCI Butner Medium I, a “medium security federal correctional institution,” according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website.
The Butner complex sits north of the Raleigh-Durham area and includes two medium security facilities, a low-security facility and a medical facility. “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski is being held at the Butner medical facility, which is also where Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernie Madoff died in 2021 while serving a 150-year sentence.
R. Kelly was previously being held in Chicago, where he was sentenced in February to 20 years in federal prison after being convicted on three counts of production of child pornography and three counts of enticement of a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity.
He was already serving a 30-year sentence on racketeering and sex trafficking charges after being convicted in New York in September 2021. Prosecutors accused R. Kelly of using his status as a celebrity and a “network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.”
Last week, attorneys for the former entertainer moved to appeal his federal racketeering conviction, calling the charge “absurdly remote” and saying it aimed to prosecute him for “alleged misdeeds going back decades without pesky statutes of limitations obstacles.”
The federal statute under which R. Kelly was charged requires proof of an ongoing criminal enterprise. His attorneys allege the prosecution failed to show there was a “collective of individuals who shared any common purpose other than to promote” R. Kelly’s music.
“Numerous seated jurors were either familiar with accusations that Defendant had a history of sexually abusing underage girls, had previously faced legal problems, and/or had seen the highly unflattering docuseries, Surviving R. Kelly, in which several government witnesses had appeared,” a brief filed last Wednesday said.
“Defense counsel did not move to disqualify jurors who admitted they had prejudged Defendant’s guilt or had gathered knowledge about the case from other sources,” it added.",2023-04-25T15:52:19Z,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network
R. Kelly moved from Chicago to North Carolina Butner prison,"Disgraced singer R. Kelly, who is currently serving 30 years behind bars for child sex crimes and sex trafficking, was moved last week from a Chicago correctional center to a medium-security prison known for housing high-profile inmates in North Carolina.
The 56-year-old R&B artist, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was transferred from the Metropolitan Correctional Center Chicago to Butner Federal Correctional Complex on April 19.
FMC Butner has housed some of America’s most notorious criminals, including Bernie Madoff, the “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, John Hinckley Jr. and Joe Exotic.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons does not disclose reasons for inmate transfers, but a statement from Kelly’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, indicated that Kelly was in need of medical treatment.
“He continues to suffer from health issues caused by medical negligence at the MCC Chicago. We are hopeful that Butner will ensure that his medical needs are met,” Bonjean said.
In February, Kelly was sentenced to 20 years in prison for child pornography and enticement of minors for sex. He will serve 19 of those years concurrently with his existing 30-year sentence for sexually abusing women and underage girls and boys.

The 56-year-old Grammy Award-winning singer, who was raised in poverty in Chicago and went on to become one of the world’s biggest R&B stars, has forcefully denied the allegations, which first began circulating in the 1990s.
After his transfer, Kelly’s attorney said they filed his brief in the Second Circuit to challenge his “unjust conviction” and 30-year sentence.
Last year, the disgraced recording artist was convicted on federal child pornography charges for making videos of himself abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter.

It topped a 30-year sentence that the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer received after he was found guilty of sex trafficking and racketeering in a separate federal case in Brooklyn.
Kelly is expected to be eligible for release from prison when he is 80 years old.
FMC Butner is a medium-security facility located about 25 miles northwest of Raleigh.
It houses 771 inmates in total, according to its website, and is known for its medical facilities.

Prime Video Nordics Lines Up Study Of ABBA Stalker As First Doc,"EXCLUSIVE: Prime Video has been quietly ramping up its Nordic originals slate, and it’s now found its first documentary.
We can reveal the streamer’s Nordic arm has ordered Take a Chance, which will launch in the UK, Nordics and the rest of Europe on May 19. You can watch a trailer for the program below.
The doc has “unique, unfiltered” access to Gert van der Graaf, an infamous stalker who reveals how a childhood crush on ABBA superstar Agnetha Fältskog turned into an obsession that shaped the rest of his life. Experts, psychologists, friends and van der Graaf himself explore how compulsive fandom can become criminal obsession.
The 85-minute doc comes from Kreativ Inc., Sweden’s A Rabbit Hole and Banjiay Americas-owned U.S. producer Bunim-Murray Productions. Maria Thulin is the director and Banijay Rights has international distribution rights outside Europe.
The EPs are Swedish-born former Zodiak USA CEO Joel Karlsberg, who was an exec producer on Lifetime’s crime doc series ratings hit Surviving R. Kelly through his Kreativ Inc. imprint, and A Rabbit Hole CEO John Mork (Rörelsen, Balkongfallet).
Kreativ Inc. has a production deal with Bunim-Murray, the unscripted producer known for the likes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, The Real World and Born This Way. Bunim-Murray was also part of the Surviving R. Kelly squad.
“Obsessive fandom and stalkers can feel far removed from our daily lives, but they are a reality for some,” said director Thulin. “According to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, hundreds of thousands of Swedish women have been harassed or persecuted by stalkers, and we believe it is important to shed light on this. The documentary gives the audience inside access into a hair-raising story about stalking.”
Take a Chance marks the first Prime Video Nordics original since Deadline revealed Martin Backlund had been promoted to Managing Director os Amazon’s streaming business in the region. Previously, he was Head of Content for the UK and the Nordics, with Tushar Jindal upped from a movie-focused role to replace him in the UK.
Last year, Prime Video Nordics ordered a slew of unscripted originals, including LOL: Last One Laughing, The Bridge, Pranked, and Good Luck Guys. It was also behind scripted comedy Toppen.
“Our local content slate is growing, and with Take a Chance, we add a genre-bending documentary that spans crime, music, mystery, and fandom,” said Backlund. “We aim to offer our Nordic customers relevant content, with local storytelling and filmmaking behind it, and we believe this local story will be of interest to many.”",2023-04-24T05:00:00Z,https://deadline.com,Deadline

R. Kelly is appealing his 2021 sex trafficking and racketeering convictions in New York and wants a new trial,"CNN —
Disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly is appealing one of his two federal convictions – his September 2021 guilty verdicts on sex trafficking and racketeering charges in New York – and is seeking a reversal of that conviction or a new trial, court documents show.
In a brief filed Wednesday, the singer’s attorneys argue at least four seated jurors in the New York case were already familiar with the sex trafficking accusations raised against R. Kelly prior to trial, with some having seen a documentary series about him.
“Numerous seated jurors were either familiar with accusations that Defendant had a history of sexually abusing underage girls, had previously faced legal problems, and/or had seen the highly unflattering docuseries, Surviving R. Kelly, in which several government witnesses had appeared,” the brief said.
“Defense counsel did not move to disqualify jurors who admitted they had prejudged Defendant’s guilt or had gathered knowledge about the case from other sources,” it added.
R. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in a New York federal court after a jury convicted him of nine counts, including one charge of racketeering and eight counts of violations of the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York accused Kelly of using his status as a celebrity and a “network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.”
Separately, R. Kelly earlier this year was sentenced to 20 years in prison in a Chicago federal courtroom following a 2022 conviction on charges of child pornography and enticement of a minor.
In their brief filed in the New York case this week, R. Kelly’s attorneys described his federal racketeering charge as “absurdly remote,” saying it aimed to prosecute him for “alleged misdeeds going back decades without pesky statutes of limitations obstacles.”
The federal statute under which R. Kelly was charged requires proof of an ongoing criminal enterprise. His attorneys allege the prosecution failed to show there was a “collective of individuals who shared any common purpose other than to promote” R. Kelly’s music.
“The government brought a (racketeering) prosecution against Defendant, not to remedy widespread criminal activity of an enterprise, but to punish one man whose alleged crimes could no longer be prosecuted by state and local agencies,” the brief says.
The attorneys also argue prosecutors “swamped the jury with excessive other bad act evidence” that should not have been allowed in the trial, including medical documents that detail R. Kelly’s contraction and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases; his alleged mistreatment of employees; audio in which he allegedly both verbally and physically assaulted his girlfriend, which they allege was unrelated to the case; and “audio and video-recordings of this conduct with women and men, some of whom never testified.”
After R. Kelly’s sentencing, the government seized nearly $28,000 from his trust account. He also was ordered to pay more than $360,000 in restitution to two separate women who alleged they had contracted herpes from him.
The singer’s attorneys are also seeking to vacate those orders and return the funds confiscated from his trust account.",2023-04-20T23:43:17Z,https://edition.cnn.com,Cable News Network
Surviving R Kelly Part III: The Final Chapter review - this glorious series has helped to make history,"Learning about the crimes of Robert Sylvester Kelly is a gruelling experience for even the most unflappable among us. Anyone susceptible to being triggered by sexual abuse, violence and child cruelty should give the subject the widest of berths. But after two seasons of unflinchingly charting allegations of decades of horrific abuse enacted by R Kelly, the tone of Netflix’s third season is markedly different from what came before: it is joyful, at times bordering on giddy. The R&B megastar was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking in 2021 and faces trial for two more charges in Minnesota and 10 in Illinois. This is no longer just about survival – it’s a victory lap.
The programme does not understate its impact and begins with a montage of politicians and celebrities referencing it. At its most deliciously smug moment, it even shows footage of Kelly and his lawyers freaking out about the documentary, calling the creators and subject liars and fruitlessly mocking their campaign. Oronike Odeleye, co-founder of Mute R Kelly, grins from ear to ear as she talks about being sent the footage by those who thought it was “outrageous”, but she would respond: “No, it’s wonderful. This is beautiful. He knows who we are. He is actually feeling the effects of what we’re doing.”
With dozens of accusers, hundreds of witnesses and mountains of evidence, it may seem surprising that Kelly “feeling the effects” of his victims speaking out was not assured. But, as we are frequently reminded, the justice system is skewed in favour of powerful men, and for 30 years, his crimes amounted to little more than punchlines for Dave Chappelle and Aziz Ansari. The documentary credits not just itself but the cultural shifts post #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter for finally holding him to account. Journalist Jim De Rogatis appears frequently, having been the interviewee in a 2013 piece that sparked much of the activism and attention that snowballed as those cultural changes happened. One of his interview’s most potent and upsetting lines is quoted here by #MeToo founder Tarana Burke: “The saddest fact I’ve learned is: nobody matters less to our society than young Black women.” Now, seeing survivors empowered by this odious sadist’s comeuppance, taking their recovery and mental health seriously, and having their stories given weight not just by the documentary but by broader society, is beautiful to behold.
The abuse, of course, does not end with Kelly. Many lawyers, assistants, music executives and managers who were accused of facilitating his crimes were granted immunity by the courts or faced no real consequences. But even the most enraging injustices evolve into a moving tribute to the bravery of the victims, and the fortitude required to recount the worst events of your life and then have them picked apart by Kelly’s lawyers and many fans. Even for those familiar with the accusations that sent him to prison, hearing details of groomed Black children being raped, ejaculated on and forced to drink the urine and eat the faeces of a middle-aged singer is utterly nauseating. The journalist Taryn Finley is noticeably shaking as she says: “Even recounting, my body is kind of having the same physiological response that it had then. I was sick.”
But watching the four episodes, repulsion and righteous fury give way to immense pride in every activist, survivor, journalist and film-maker who took on this wolf in wolf’s clothing and demanded he be held accountable. Seeing their relief when Kelly is finally convicted is genuinely glorious. The show’s creator, Dream Hampton, accepts a large slice of the credit and receives effusive compliments in a conversation with fellow film-maker-activist W Kamau Bell to celebrate the tangible impact of her work. But she sets her ambitions even higher: to break down the system that underserves and abuses Black women. There is work to be done but, ultimately, this is a celebration, and it invites us to laugh at comedians speculating that the number of years in R Kelly’s sentence “is going to look like a bowling score”.
The show makes its intentions explicit: whatever motivated Kelly is unimportant. This is about the women who can now rebuild their lives while he rots in a cell. The charismatic survivor Kitti Jones almost pleads down the lens when she asks: “Can we focus on the fact that this happened here? And these Black women were heard and they made history. They fought no matter what they were up against.” For all the cruelty, this is ultimately a tale of David taking on Goliath. There are horrors that still need to be confronted, but for now, a well-deserved breath of relief can be taken, and a rapturous round of applause should be received.

Opinion | The Painful Lesson Donald Trump Could Learn from R. Kelly and Michael Avenatti,"But today’s announcement is not good news for Trump. Even if he ultimately beats the charges in Manhattan, the mere fact that he is facing charges there will make it more difficult for him to defend himself in criminal cases elsewhere, be it Fulton County, federal court in Washington, or Florida where a classified documents case might be filed.
I’ve defended clients who face charges in multiple jurisdictions at the same time, and it’s a challenge. One might think that each case stands on its own merits, but in reality there is a multiplier effect that works against defendants. Instead of considering the best move in any one particular case, defense counsel have to consider how their words or actions in one case (Manhattan, for example) will impact other cases, including ones that haven’t been charged yet. Defending a client facing charges in multiple jurisdictions requires a defense team to weigh competing priorities and play three-dimensional chess while the prosecutors in each case can focus like a laser on the case at hand.
Don’t believe me? Just ask the beleaguered lawyers who defended R. Kelly in a wide-ranging racketeering case in New York federal court, an obstruction and child pornography case in Chicago federal court, a solicitation of a minor and child prostitution case in Minnesota state court, and a child sex abuse case in Chicago state court at the same time. They managed to ensure that the weakest case — the New York racketeering case — went first. But Kelly lost in both New York and Chicago federal court, even though some of his Chicago co-defendants were acquitted, and he was subsequently sentenced to 31 years in federal prison.
Michael Avenatti, who once represented Trump accuser Stormy Daniels, faced a similar meat grinder. In late March 2019, Avenatti was charged by federal prosecutors in New York with attempting to extort $25 million from Nike. On the same day, federal prosecutors in California charged Avenatti with wire fraud and bank fraud. Less than a month later, he was charged with embezzling money from clients. A month after that, prosecutors charged him with defrauding Daniels out of proceeds from her book deal. Avenatti lost the Nike extortion trial in New York in early 2020. Two years later, he pleaded guilty to stealing millions of dollars from his clients in California. The bottom line is that he prevailed in none of the cases and is due to be released in 2036.
One of the challenges facing most defendants who juggle cases in multiple jurisdictions is a drain on resources and attention. By the time Avenatti stood trial in California, he was out of funds and represented himself. Kelly, a multiple platinum-selling R&B singer whose net worth was once estimated at nearly $100 million, was so broke that he was unable to post $100,000 in bail. Trump likely won’t have that problem, so long as he can continue to pay for his legal bills using money raised by his political action committee.
But a conviction can be a problem for a defendant like Trump in a later trial. By the time Avenatti and Kelly reached their second trials, they were both convicted felons, which made it difficult for either to take the stand in his own defense. One of R. Kelly’s co-defendants testified for over four hours, and was ultimately acquitted, but Kelly couldn’t even consider doing so given his prior conviction. Trump needs a clean sweep in Manhattan to avoid a similar fate. Even a conviction on a misdemeanor falsifying business records charge, for example, would potentially be admissible to impeach Trump’s credibility if he testified in a federal trial.
Even if Trump is acquitted in Manhattan, that case might still create problems for his legal team. Typically, defense attorneys avoid taking positions — or having their clients say much at all — because every word from the client can be used against him in subsequent proceedings. If Trump takes the witness stand in Manhattan, prosecutors in other jurisdictions can comb through the transcript for nuggets to use against him in other trials.
Of course, Trump’s lawyers also appear to be unable to keep him from speaking publicly about the Manhattan charges. Those public statements, outside of a courtroom, can be used against him too.
The documents produced by Trump’s team in the Manhattan case can be obtained and used by prosecutors elsewhere. The legal positions he takes can preclude him from taking the opposite position elsewhere. A judge would be far less likely to take Trump’s position seriously in a subsequent case if he had taken a contradictory position earlier. The witnesses who testify on his behalf will never surprise another prosecutor again with their presence or their testimony.
When I was a federal prosecutor, the defense attorneys who gave me the most trouble were nimble and aggressive, hitting me with arguments and evidence that I did not expect. But it’s difficult to be nimble or aggressive when you have to consider how each word you say and action you take impacts multiple other cases that have been or could be brought against your client. That is the unenviable position that Trump’s attorneys find themselves in.
To be clear, Trump is not going to prison simply because multiple prosecutors might indict him simultaneously. Facts matter, of course, and defendants have tools they can use to manage this difficult situation. Trump’s team could try to employ a strategy used by the attorneys for the late Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, who requested a speedy trial in his corruption case and won an acquittal. But there was only one case against Stevens and it was weak from the start. (A subsequent investigation revealed that federal prosecutors withheld evidence beneficial to Stevens.)
Trump and his team can take solace that the first prosecutor up to the plate has a relatively weak case, but no one with experience handling multiple cases at once would argue that Thursday was a good day for Team Trump. They face the prospect of a multi-front war and they may not have the luxury of fighting one battle at a time.",2023-03-30T23:29:05Z,https://www.politico.com,POLITICO
"Financial Literacy Needed For CA Kids, Southwest RivCo Lawmaker Says","Crime & Safety Financial Literacy Needed For CA Kids, Southwest RivCo Lawmaker Says Young adults have worse outcomes, more debt, and fewer assets than ever before, according to state Sen. Kelly Seyarto (R-Murrieta). Replies (2)
Currently, only one in four students participate in personal finance courses where offered, according to state Sen. Kelly Seyarto (R-Murrieta). (Shutterstock)
MURRIETA, CA — A California bill introduced by a Southwest Riverside County lawmaker would, if passed, make it mandatory that California’s K-12 curriculum include periodic financial literacy education, but a vote this week pushed that from happening in the near term.
State Senate Bill 342 introduced by Sen. Kelly Seyarto (R-Murrieta) failed during a vote Wednesday in the state Senate’s Education Committee, although the bill will be reconsidered in committee at a later date. Wednesday's vote was 3 yeas, 1 no, and 3 absent. Disappointment prompted Seyarto to pen an op-ed, laying out his impassioned push for financial literacy among young people.
The state senator, who represents all Southwest Riverside County cities, wrote that students should be prepared for real-life scenarios and best practices when it comes to managing their money. Under SB 342, ""teachers would be able to include age-appropriate information based on their students’ grade levels and proficiency, and could address various topics, including personal banking, budgeting, taxes, and planning for college expenses. Since SB 342 would not add an additional class, and would be integrated into the already-scheduled 2024 curriculum revision, it would not impose financial burdens on California’s schools,"" according to Seyarto.
He continued, ""Personally, I benefitted from being raised by a teacher who knew the value of instilling financial literacy skills in his kids. We struggled financially, but my father managed to keep our home, keep us clothed and keep us fed, even after having our household income slashed in half after our mother’s death. This taught me valuable lessons that I took into adulthood. ""Unfortunately, with today’s volatile economy and lack of financial literacy education, young adults have worse outcomes, more debt, and fewer assets than ever before, and the problem is even more prevalent in black and brown communities,"" he wrote.
During Wednesday's committee hearing, Sen. Josh Newman (D-Fullerton) voted no on the legislation — not because he doesn't support it. Instead, he argued the state legislature makes recommendations on education curriculum, not mandates. Seyarto snapped back.
""I'll be damned if I'm going to let [the state's Instructional Quality Commission] dictate what we parents and we as citizenry want our kids to learn,"" he said during Wednesday's hearing. If SB 342 were passed, financial literacy could be included in the state's 2024 curriculum update, according to Seyarto. Money management for kids is on the state's radar, but it's a slow process. In September, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond hosted a virtual webinar to update K-12 educators about news that over $3.6 billion in state block grants and other resources were available to promote financial literacy in classrooms. The one-time grant is available through the 2025–26 fiscal year. The month prior, Thurmond announced he had secured $1.4 million in private funding for teachers in California high schools to receive professional development courtesy of Next Gen Personal Finance to teach financial literacy.",2023-03-30T20:40:13Z,https://patch.com,"Joliet, IL Patch"
"Who Gets R. Kelly’s Royalties? Plus 50 Cent, Childish Gambino, Afroman","This is The Legal Beat, a weekly newsletter about music law from Billboard Pro, offering you a one-stop cheat sheet of big new cases, important rulings and all the fun stuff in between.
This week: A court ruling on R. Kelly’s music royalties offers some answers but raises new questions; 50 Cent reaches a deal to end his lawsuit over alleged insinuations that he had penis surgery; Donald Glover defeats a copyright lawsuit over the Childish Gambino hit “This Is America”; Ohio cops sue Afroman for using their images after they raided his home with guns drawn; and much more.
THE BIG STORY: Who Gets R. Kelly’s Record Royalties?
Twice convicted on allegations of sexual abuse and facing decades in federal prison, R. Kelly owes a lot of money to a lot of people. Luckily, a pile of recording royalties are sitting in his account at Sony Music. But who gets first access to them?
In a ruling last week, the Illinois Supreme Court said first dibs belong to Heather Williams, an abuse victim who won a $4 million civil judgment against Kelly in 2020. For procedural reasons, the appeals court said Williams should take priority over Midwest Commercial Funding, a Chicago landlord that’s owed $3.5 million from Kelly over unpaid rent at a local studio space. The court upheld an earlier ruling that had ordered Sony to hand over “any funds currently in Kelly’s royalty account” to Williams, and keep giving her his incoming royalties until the judgment was paid off.
While state high court’s decision offered some important clarity – the Sony account had been frozen for years while the case played out across the appeals courts – it left plenty of big questions unanswered.
-According to the decision, Kelly’s account held $1.5 million in 2020 when Williams initially demanded that Sony hand it over. But how much more money has been accrued since then? And how much is coming in each year? Sony declined to comment on the situation when asked.
-What about Kelly’s criminal victims? Federal judges in New York and Illinois have ordered him to pay more than $500,000 in restitution and fines after he was convicted on sex trafficking, racketeering and child porn charges. Should those victims also get access to the record royalties? Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Chicago both declined to comment on the situation.
-Kelly’s lawyers are currently trying to overturn the underlying $4 million judgment for Williams, arguing it was handed down when the singer was stuck in prison and that he was not afforded a proper chance to fight back. Those efforts face an uphill climb, but at the very least could delay any final payments.
-Finally, it’s important to note that last week’s ruling was limited to his record royalties. The extent to which Kelly is still earning money from his compositional rights, and whether he would be able sell those rights for anything other than “fire sale” prices, is an even murkier situation.

“ENTIRELY DIFFERENT” – A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing Donald Glover of ripping off his chart-topping Childish Gambino hit “This Is America” from an earlier song by a rapper named Kidd Wes called “Made In America.” The judge said the lyrics were “entirely different” and that the accuser failed to satisfy even basic procedural requirements.

"R. Kelly Victim Gets Priority Access to Sony Royalties, Court Rules","An R. Kelly victim who won a $4 million judgment against the singer will get first crack at pulling money from the singer’s royalty account with Sony Music — after the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that her claims should take priority over a Chicago landlord that’s also owed millions.
In a decision on Thursday (March 23), the state high court said Heather Williams was entitled to tap into Kelly’s account with Sony — valued at $1.5 million in 2020 — before Midwest Commercial Funding, a property manager that won its own separate $3.5 million ruling against Kelly over unpaid rent at a Chicago studio, can access it.
Williams filed a civil lawsuit against Kelly in 2019, alleging that when she was 16 years old, the singer lured her into his studio with promises that she could be in a music video and then repeatedly had sex with her as a minor. In 2020, she won a judgment of $4 million against Kelly on those accusations.
Thursday’s decision upheld a lower court’s earlier ruling that Williams — and not Midwest Commercial — should be given priority access to the royalties because she was the first to properly demand the money from Sony. That earlier ruling had ordered Sony to hand over to Williams “any funds currently in Kelly’s royalty account,” and to keep giving her his royalties until the judgment was paid off.
Disbursement of Kelly’s funds held by Sony has been paused while litigation has played out; it’s unclear how much money is now in the account. The company is not named in any lawsuits and is not accused of any wrongdoing. A rep for Sony declined to comment on the ruling or on the status of Kelly’s royalties.
Following Thursday’s ruling, Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, tells Billboard that she’s currently seeking to overturn the underlying $4 million judgment. She says the award to Williams — a so-called default judgment, meaning it was issued after Kelly failed to respond — “never should have been entered.”
“I’ve never in my career seen such a flouting of the rules to deny him even the opportunity to defend these civil cases, even when the courts were fully aware that Kelly was incarcerated, unrepresented at points, and facing multiple criminal indictments,” Bonjean says. “Indeed, much of these civil proceedings occurred without Kelly’s knowledge.”
But the $4 million judgment was already upheld once by an appeals court, and Bonjean said she faces an “uphill battle” to overturn the judgment because of the actions of Kelly’s prior lawyers.
An attorney for Williams declined to comment on the litigation. An attorney for Midwest Commercial Funding did not return a request for comment.
Though Thursday’s decision gave priority to Williams over Midwest Commercial Funding, it’s unclear whether she’ll enjoy similar priority over a slew of additional monetary penalties that Kelly owes to victims as a result of his federal criminal convictions.
After he was sentenced last summer to 30 years in prison for sex trafficking and racketeering in New York, Kelly was ordered to pay more than $480,000 in fines and restitution; after he was sentenced in February on child pornography charges in Illinois, another $42,000 was tacked on. Last fall, prosecutors confiscated nearly $30,000 in Kelly’s prison account in an effort to start paying those penalties.

"How Long Will R. Kelly, Harvey Weinstein Be in Jail?","Photo: Getty Images
On February 23, convicted sex criminals Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly, both currently in jail, were sentenced in their second respective sex-crimes trials in as many years. Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison after being found guilty of rape in his Los Angeles trial last December. In Chicago, Kelly, real name Robert Sylvester Kelly, was sentenced to 20 years in lockup following a September 2022 trial where, after years of allegations, he was found guilty of child-pornography counts. Their decades-long sentences mark the end of an arduous journey of cross-country criminal proceedings, numerous survivors, and dozens of accusers. The fallen film producer was previously found guilty on February 24, 2020, of rape in his New York City trial, and was sentenced on March 11 of that year to 23 years’ imprisonment. The disgraced R&B singer was convicted on September 27, 2021, in his Brooklyn federal court racketeering and sex-crimes trial and was sentenced on June 29, 2022, to 30 years in prison. The trials of the two men who used their power and influence to target primarily young women and, for R. Kelly, minor teens, will forever be linked to the against these men during the Me Too movement, which inspired survivors to speak out and share — which was itself prompted by revelations of sexual-misconduct allegations against Weinstein. While both men have been twice convicted of sex crimes, legal proceedings against them have yet to end. Ahead of the next developments in their appeals, here are your biggest questions about Weinstein and Kelly’s criminal proceedings answered.
How many years will Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly be in jail?
The jail time is racking up. Weinstein, 70, is serving what effectively amounts to a life sentence. The judge in his Los Angeles case said that Weinstein’s near-two-decade sentence would run consecutively with his New York sentence, totaling 39 years behind bars. Kelly has a chance that he won’t spend the rest of his life in prison. His Chicago sentence will run concurrently with his Brooklyn sentence, so he would only wind up serving one more year on top of the sentence from his New York case.
Have R. Kelly and Weinstein already appealed their convictions?
Weinstein is currently appealing his New York City conviction. After a lower-state appeals panel rejected his bid for appeal, the New York State Court of Appeals agreed to hear his case. Weinstein has said he will also appeal his California conviction, according to the New York Times. Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, told Vulture that he would not be appealing the Chicago conviction but is reportedly appealing his Brooklyn conviction.
The chances of securing a new trial, let alone overturning a conviction, are very slim at the state and federal levels. While both men have described themselves as victims of the Me Too movement and their sentencings a result of a desire to punish them for society’s overall neglect to address sexual violence against women, they have to argue on legal grounds, not purported unfairness. Official data shows that less than 9 percent of federal appeals resulted in reversals of lower-court outcomes.
Aren’t there other cases against Weinstein and Kelly that are ongoing?
Weinstein remains in legal hot water on several fronts. A model at the center of his L.A. trial sued him in early February, citing sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, according to the Los Angeles Times. In June 2022, prosecutors in England authorized indecent-assault charges against Weinstein. While the state-level charges against Kelly in Chicago were dismissed, it’s unclear what will happen with his pending Minnesota sex-abuse case. “We will defend that case too if need be,” Bonjean said.
What have the men said about their latest sentencing?
For years, Weinstein and Kelly have maintained the proceedings against them were more about societal anger over women’s treatment than anything they personally did. “My general comment is that these blood-thirsty #metoo prosecutions of high-profile men have done nothing more than allow prosecutors to pat themselves on the back in press conferences and make a lot of people rich,” Bonjean told Vulture in an email. “These symbolic prosecutions have done nothing to improve the lives of women in society. Misogyny is alive and well.”
Weinstein’s rep, Juda Engelmayer, described the proceedings as “alarming and awful for our society”: “The media coverage has been driven by a seemingly popular appeal, which I believe has led to biased legal and judicial processes by people more concerned about their political and professional lives, or their own extreme ideologies, than truly being arbiters of justice. Harvey Weinstein was the symbol and truth or facts didn’t matter … That’s what this societal shift has caused: Just get him at any cost, no matter how — laws and due process be damned. That’s a scary and slippery slope for us all.” In a statement sent through Engelmayer, Weinstein said, “It is incredible to be convicted for a crime I wasn’t even present for. I am innocent. I never raped or assaulted anyone. This person perjured herself at least three times and then sued for money when she said on the stand that she would ‘never.’ I was never with her. Her entire claim thing was a setup for a money grab.”
What about the survivors?
Survivors and accusers have heralded the sentences, while acknowledging there is still more to be done, especially amid ongoing conversations around Me Too and its longevity. In previous statements and in the final installation of the three-part documentary series Surviving R. Kelly, Kelly’s survivors have spoken out about the yearslong wait to see Kelly face consequences for his actions and abuse. Last week, Saving Grace actress Caitlin Dulany, who first spoke out about an alleged 1996 assault following the New York Times’ investigation of Weinstein, shared an emotional statement in light of Weinstein’s sentence. “While there will always be a deep sadness and a heaviness in my heart because of the sexual assault I suffered at the hands of Harvey Weinstein more than 27 years ago, today I feel a sense of vindication. Knowing that Weinstein was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the crimes he committed against me and others ensures that some measure of justice was served today.” Dulany continued, “I stand with my fellow survivors who bravely came forward to tell the world about their experiences with Weinstein and then to relive those stories year after year, trial after trial to be a collective voice for all survivors, especially the voiceless. While any amount of time in prison could never make up for the trauma Weinstein caused each of his victims to suffer — a trauma we carry and will continue to carry with us every day of our lives — I have a sense of peace knowing that he will likely spend the remainder of his life in prison.”",2023-03-03T20:00:12Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
"R. Kelly bekommt die nächsten 20 Jahre Knast, doch das ""Schlimmste"" bleibt ihm erspart","30 plus 20 macht 50. Diese Rechnung bekommt wohl jeder hin, der halbwegs mathematisch unterwegs ist.

"R. Kelly, condenado a 20 años de cárcel por abusos sexuales a menores","El reconocido y popular cantante americano Robert Sylvester Kelly, más conocido artísticamente como R.Kelly, ha sido condenado a 20 años de prisión por delitos de pornografía infantil y seducción de menores, tal y como recoge la sentencia emitida por un juez federal del Tribunal del Distrito Norte de Illinois. El intérprete musical fue declarado culpable de hasta seis delitos sexuales por grabar videos pornográficos a menores de edad, entre los que se incluía su ahijada de 14 años.
La Fiscalía, que considera que el acusado ostenta “una ausencia total de remordimiento”, solicitó al magistrado que la única forma de asegurar que Kelly no sea un verdadero peligro para la sociedad “es mantenerlo en prisión el resto de su vida”, según declaró el fiscal Jeannice Williams Appenteng.
Estas acusaciones se remontan a la década de los 90 cuando varias personas anónimas sacaron a la luz varias cintas explícitas, donde se apreciaba al cantante manteniendo relaciones sexuales con menores. Además, una mujer de 37 años, llamada Jane, reconoció que con 15 años estuvo obligada a ejercer “cientos de actos sexuales” hasta que cumplió la mayoría de edad.
Una nueva condena
Esto no es todo, el cantante de I Believe I Can Fly ya fue condenado previamente a 30 años de cárcel tras ser acusado por asociación ilícita y tráfico sexual, por lo que cumplirá ambos castigos de manera simultánea. Sin embargo, Jennifer Bonjean, su defensa, ha conseguido que solo este un año en la cárcel de Chicago por este nuevo castigo, una vez que finalice la condena de 30 años que tiene que cumplir en el estado de Nueva York.

A federal judge on Thursday rejected a call from prosecutors to keep R. Kelly behind bars until he is 100, instead telling the Grammy Award-winning R&B singer he would serve all but one of his 20 years on child sex convictions simultaneously with a previous racketeering sentence.
Handed down in a courtoom in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago, the sentence means Kelly could make it out of prison alive, when he is about 80. Prosecutors had asked Judge Harry Leinenweber to sentence him to 25 years — and to not let him begin serving those until after he completed the first 30-year sentence, imposed on him last year in New York.
“The nature of this offense is … horrific,” Leinenweber said in explaining the 20-year sentence. He noted that Kelly’s sexual abuse victims would suffer from his crimes for the rest of their lives.
At the same time, he accepted defense arguments that Kelly might not even make it to 80, so handing him a consecutive lengthy sentence, rather than allowing him to serve all but one year of it simultaneously, didn’t make much sense.
“He has a life expectancy of not a hell of a lot more,” the judge said. “He is 56 years of age.”
Kelly’s defense lawyer celebated the ruling as a victory, and some of the singer’s fans could be heard cheering outside the courtroom.
Kelly remained still, his eyes downcast, as Leinenweber explained what was at times a hard-to-follow sentence. He did seem to show some emotion when a representative read a statement written by “Jane,” one of his accusers and a key prosecution witness.
“I was brainwashed by Robert and a sex slave,” Jane’s statement said. “It almost killed me.”
Kelly did not make a statement in court prior to the sentencing decision, heeding the advice of his lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, to stay quiet while they appeal both his Chicago and New York convictions.
“It’s the right outcome,” Bonjean said. “The judge was reasonable. He, I think, took into account both sides and ultimately was fair.”
The U.S. Attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, conceded that prosecutors were disappointed Kelly didn’t receive more consecutive prison time. But he added, “Twenty years is a significant sentence, and we are happy that that was imposed in this case.”
The judge said at the outset of the hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to woo underage girls for sex, a determination that was important in deciding whether to extend Kelly’s current term sigificantly.
“The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court. “It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly)’. … It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”
Two of Kelly’s accusers asked the judge to punish him harshly.
“When your virginity is taken by a pedophile at 14 … your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia,” addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly point out her alleged faults while he abused her.
“Now you are here … because there is something wrong with you,” she said. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”
Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly last year on six of 13 counts: three of producing child porn and three of enticement of minors for sex. Prosecutors did not get a conviction on the marquee charge: that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Kelly rose from poverty in Chicago to become one of the world’s biggest R&B stars. Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” he sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.
Prosecutors described Kelly as “a serial sexual predator” who used his fame and wealth to reel in, sexually abuse and then discard star-struck fans.
U.S. Assistant Attorney Jeannice Appenteng urged the judge to keep Kelly in prison “for the rest of his life.”
Kelly’s abuse of children was especially appalling, she said Thursday, because he “memorialized” his abuse by filming victims, including Jane. Appenteng told the court Kelly “used Jane as a sex prop, a thing” for producing pornographic videos.
But Bonjean has accused prosecutors of offering an “embellished narrative” to get the judge to join what she called the government’s “bloodthirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement.”
The singer has suffered enough, including financially, Bonjean said. She said his worth once approached $1 billion, but that he “is now destitute.”
Given his age and current 30-year sentence, Bonjean said sentencing Kelly to 25 more years would be “overkill.”
“It is symbolic,” she said. “Why? Because it is R. Kelly.”
Just before Kelly was taken back to detention Thursday, he requested that he not be placed on suicide watch because constant checks by guards “is in and of itself cruel” and “creates mental health issues,” Bonjean said.
“He was expecting this,” she told the judge. “Mr. Kelly … is not suicidal.”

R. Kelly wurde wegen Missbrauchs verurteilt. Nun verkündete ein US-Gericht das Strafmaß. Trotz langer Haftstrafe stellt dies einen kleinen Erfolg für den ehemaligen Musikstar dar.
Der ehemalige Musikstar R. Kelly ist von einem Gericht in Chicago zu einer Gefängnisstrafe von 20 Jahren verurteilt worden. Das berichteten mehrere US-Medien übereinstimmend, darunter die ""New York Times"". Das Urteil stellt jedoch einen juristischen Erfolg für Kelly dar. Denn der 56-Jährige wird lediglich ein zusätzliches Jahr hinter Gittern verbringen. Die restlichen 19 Jahre Haftzeit werden auf die 30-jährige Haftstrafe angerechnet, zu der Kelly bereits im Juni 2022 in New York verurteilt worden war.
R. Kelly wird 31 Jahre hinter Gittern verbringen
Richter Harry Leinenweber entschied damit weitestgehend gegen den Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft, die gefordert hatte, dass Kelly beide Strafen hintereinander und nicht größtenteils gleichzeitig verbüßen soll. ""Der einzige Weg sicherzustellen, dass [Kelly] nicht rückfällig werden wird, ist, eine Strafe zu verhängen, durch die er für den Rest seines Lebens im Gefängnis bleibt"", hatte Staatsanwältin Jeannice Williams Appenteng vor der Strafmaßverkündung im Gerichtssaal dargelegt.
Kelly habe in dem Prozess keine Reue für seine Taten gezeigt. Die Verteidigung hatte dagegen argumentiert, dass der Ex-Popstar ""wahrscheinlich in beiden Fällen im Gefängnis sterben"" werde.

Si R. Kelly a toujours été soupçonné d’agressions sexuelles, il a longtemps régné dans le domaine de la musique. Acquitté pour des accusations d’obstruction à la justice, il lui a également été reproché d’avoir perturbé le déroulement d’un procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, dont il était jugé non coupable, en menaçant une victime afin qu’elle ne témoigne pas.

R. Kelly condamné : combien d'années va-t-il passer en prison ?,"R KELLY. Déjà condamné à 30 ans de prison pour une série de crimes sexuels, le chanteur R. Kelly, a écopé de 20 ans supplémentaires pour pédopornographie.
[Mis à jour le 24 février 2023 à 09h53] R. Kelly de nouveau condamné. Le chanteur américain a été condamné ce jeudi 23 février à une peine de vingt ans de prison pour pédopornographie, par une cour fédérale de Chicago. La star déchue du R'n'B a été reconnue coupable de production pédopornographique et détournement de mineur. Ont notamment été diffusées des vidéos de violences sexuelles commises sur une adolescente de 14 ans.
Toutefois, cette peine de vingt ans ne s'additionnera pas à celle de trente ans à laquelle R. Kelly a déjà été condamné en juin 2022 à New York pour une série de crimes sexuels. Le juge de la cour fédérale a ordonné qu'un an supplémentaire serait ajouté à ces 30 ans de prison.
R Kelly déjà condamné
Le tribunal fédéral de Brooklyn a condamné, mercredi 29 juin 2022, le chanteur R.Kelly. Une peine qui soldait un grand nombre de chefs d'accusation, notamment extorsion, exploitation sexuelle de mineur, enlèvement, trafic, corruption et travail forcé, sur une période allant de 1994 à 2018. R. Kelly, qui a fait appel, a toujours nié ces faits dont il avait été reconnu coupable en septembre dernier.
A l'époque, les procureurs fédéraux avaient requis 25 ans de réclusion criminelle, décrivant l'interprète de I Believe I Can Fly, comme un ""criminel, prédateur"" et un ""danger"" pour ses victimes. Il avait aussi été reconnu coupable, entre autres, d'avoir dirigé pendant près de 25 ans un ""système"" d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes femmes, dont des mineures.
R.Kelly, 30 ans d'accusations
Condamné à 30 ans de prison, R.Kelly défraie la chronique depuis près d'une trentaine d'année. Dès le début de sa carrière, il est accusé de pédophilie. Le premier scandale remonte à 1994, époque à laquelle il fréquence une jeune femme, Aaliyah, avec qui il se serait marié en falsifiant son âge, la faisant passer de 15 ans à 18 ans. A l'époque, R.Kelly lui, était âgé de 27 ans. Le mariage sera annulé deux mois plus tard et la jeune femme décèdera en 2001.
En 1998, R.Kelly aurait acheté le silence de Tiffany Hawkins, qui assure avoir eu des relations sexuelles avec le chanteur lorsqu'elle avait 15 ans, pour 250 000 dollars. Même processus en 2001 avec Tracy Sampson, une ancienne stagiaire avec qui il aurait eu des rapports sexuels lorsqu'elle avait 17 ans. A l'époque, toutes ces accusations se soldent par un acquittement ou un non lieu.
En 2019, le documentaire intitulé Surviving R.Kelly déclenche un séisme et les accusations de viol pleuvent. Pour R.Kelly, c'est le début de la chute. Le chanteur est inculpé dans plusieurs États américains pour différents chefs d'accusation, notamment à Chicago et dans les Etats de l'Illinois et de New York
R. Kelly jugé coupable
Après plus d'un mois de procès, le verdict est tombé : R. Kelly a été reconnu coupable de ""trafic sexuel"", lundi 27 septembre 2021 par le tribunal fédéral de Brooklyn, à New York. Pendant plus d'un mois, l'ancienne star du R'n'B, connue pour son tube I Believe I Can Fly, a été jugée pour une série de crimes sexuels, notamment pour extorsion, exploitation sexuelle de mineur, enlèvement, corruption et travail forcé, sur une période allant de 1994 à 2018.
Cette affaire et cette condamnation marquaient déjà un tournant fort dans le mouvement #metoo, la star déchue étant accusée majoritairement par des femmes, noires, venues décrire à la barre des viols, des prises de drogues forcées, des situations d'emprisonnement ou encore des faits de pédopornographie. R. Kelly, lui, a toujours plaidé non coupable.
Les témoignages contre R. Kelly
Au total, onze personnes ont témoigné contre l'artiste, neuf femmes et deux hommes. A la barre, une accusatrice du nom d'Angela a affirmé avoir été témoin d'agressions sexuelles du chanteur sur la chanteuse Aaliyah (décédée dans un crash d'avion en 2001), que l'artiste avait épousée illégalement alors qu'elle était âgée de 15 ans. Devant les juges, Angela a expliqué à la barre avoir surpris un rapport sexuel entre le chanteur et la jeune fille, âgée de 13 ou 14 ans à l'époque, rapporte le New York Times. Elle serait la plus jeune victime connue de R. Kelly.
Parmi les autres accusateurs de l'artiste, Jane Doe No 5 (selon le nom cité dans le rapport judiciaire), qui accuse R. Kelly de l'avoir abusé à plusieurs reprises durant cinq ans, alors qu'il était âgé de 17 ans. Ce témoin explique avoir contracté de l'herpès après ses rapports avec le chanteur, qui serait sous traitement pour cette maladie sexuellement transmissible depuis 2007. Une autre des neuf accusatrices de R. Kelly assure également avoir été contaminée.
Outre les accusations d'agressions sexuelles, les témoins ont évoqué à la barre les violences qu'ils auraient subies de la part de R. Kelly, notamment des ""punitions"" s'ils n'accédaient pas à ses désirs, ou affirment avoir été filmés contre leur gré lors d'actes sexuels, comme le détaille la BBC.
Qui est le chanteur R. Kelly ?
Robert Sylvester Kelly, alias R. Kelly, est né le 8 janvier 1967 à Chicago, dans l'Illinois, aux Etats-Unis. C'est au début des années 1990 qu'il fait ses débuts dans la musique, en participant au concours télévisé Big Break, qu'il remporte. Le jeune artiste sort un premier album, Born into the 90's, en 1992, puis 12 Play en 1993. R. Kelly se fait rapidement un nom dans le R'n'B aux Etats-Unis : en 1995, il est nommé deux fois aux Grammy Awards, pour l'écriture et la composition de la chanson de Michael Jackson, You Are Not Alone.
En 1995, sa carrière prend un tout autre tournant avec la parution de l'album R. Kelly, qui contient le tube de sa vie : I Believe I Can Fly, écrit à l'origine pour le film Space Jam. Nommée trois fois aux Grammy Awards, la chanson fait de l'artiste une star internationale. Passionné de basket, R. Kelly signe en 1997 avec les Atlantic City Seagulls de l'United States Basketball League (USBL). Il publie ensuite une douzaine d'albums, notamment R. en 1998, TP-2.com en 2000, Chocolate Factory en 2003, Double Up en 2007, Untitled en 2009, Love Letter en 2010 ou encore Write Me Back en 2012 et Black Panties en 2013. R. Kelly a travaillé avec les plus grands artistes du monde, de Michael Jackson à Lady Gaga en passant par Lil Wayne ou T.I. et T-Pain.
Une carrière prolifique entachée de scandales, dès les années 2000. En janvier 2019, le documentaire Surviving R. Kelly, diffusé sur la chaîne de télévision américaine Lifetime, le présente comme un prédateur sexuel, pédophile, à la tête d'un réseau d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes femmes et met fin à sa carrière musicale, en plein mouvement #metoo.
Qui sont les femmes de R. Kelly ?
Parallèlement à l'explosion de sa notoriété dans les années 1990, R. Kelly épouse en 1994 la chanteuse et actrice Aaliyah, âgée de 15 ans (lui en avait 27). Un mariage qui fait scandale et qui se termine par l'annulation par les parents de la mariée, qu'ils envoient en Europe. En 1996, R. Kelly se remarie avec la chorégraphe et danseuse Andrea Lee, avec qui il a trois enfants. Cette dernière fait partie des accusatrices du chanteur.",2023-02-24T08:53:00Z,https://www.linternaute.com,Linternaute.com

R. Kelly: Weitere heftige Haftstrafe - bis zu 31 Jahre,"Der Musiker R. Kelly (hier bei einer Strafmaßverkündung im Jahr 2019) wurde erneut wegen Sexualverbrechens verurteilt.
Nachdem der Musiker R. Kelly bereits im vergangenen Jahr wegen Sexualverbrechens verurteilt wurde, folgte nun eine weitere Urteilsverkündung.
Das Urteil ist gesprochen! Von der schillernden Karriere des US-Musikers R. Kelly in den 90er Jahren ist nicht mehr viel übrig. Der einstige Popstar wurde nun wegen Kinderpornografie und Verführung Minderjähriger zu 20 Jahren Haft verurteilt.
Ein Gericht in Kellys Heimatstadt Chicago entschied am Donnerstag (23. Februar 2023) jedoch, dass der frühere R&B-Star die 20-jährige Haftstrafe bis auf ein Jahr gleichzeitig mit einer im vergangenen Jahr in New York verhängten Haftstrafe von 30 Jahren für Sexualverbrechen verbüßen kann.
Weitere Haftstrafe für US-amerikanischen R&B-Sänger
Die teilweise Zusammenlegung der beiden Strafzeiten bedeutet, dass der 56-Jährige nun de facto insgesamt zu 31 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt ist. In dem Prozess in Chicago wurde Kelly zugleich von dem Vorwurf freigesprochen, die Justiz in einem früheren Kinderpornografie-Prozess von 2008 behindert zu haben, indem er die Geschworenen manipuliert habe.
Bereits im September 2022 war der Künstler, der als Robert Sylvester Kelly geboren wurde, in seinem Chicagoer Prozess in sechs von 13 Anklagepunkten schuldig gesprochen worden: drei Mal wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornographie, drei Mal für die Verführung Minderjähriger.

"R. Kelly, nuova condanna a 20 anni per crimini sessuali su minori","Nuova condanna a 20 anni di carcere per il cantante R. Kelly che va a sovrapporsi a quella di 30 che sta già scontando. Secondo quanto riporta il New York Times, il 56enne, produttore e cantante noto per successi come la hit I believe I can fly, sarebbe stato condannato dalla giuria per sei delle tredici accuse mosse contro di lui, relative a crimini contro i minori commessi negli anni '90.
Tra le accuse per le quali R. Kelly è stato condannato c'è quella di avere costretto dei minori ad avere rapporti sessuali. Inoltre, l'uomo avrebbe girato tre video che lo immortalavano mentre abusava sessualmente della sua figlioccia, che all'epoca aveva 14 anni. È stato, invece, assolto dall'accusa di avere tentato di ostacolare le indagini sugli abusi che avrebbe commesso sulla quattordicenne.
Come spiega Variety, R. Kelly sta già scontando 30 anni di prigione per sfruttamento sessuale. Sebbene la richiesta fosse quella di fargli scontare altri 25 anni in carcere da aggiungere ai 30 attuali, il giudice ha stabilito che gli anni delle due condanne, eccetto uno, siano scontati contemporaneamente. Dunque, R. Kelly ha evitato così l'ergastolo e sconterà 31 anni di prigione in totale. Il New York Times fa sapere che il motivo per cui era stata richiesta per il cantante una condanna a 25 anni da sommare ai 30 della condanna precedente era la sua «assenza di rimorso».",2023-02-24T07:20:00Z,https://www.lastampa.it,La Stampa

En effet, en septembre dernier, il a été reconnu coupable mais avait été acquitté pour d'autres chefs d'inculpation. ""Robert Kelly est un prédateur sexuel en série qui, au fil des années, a ciblé des jeunes femmes tout en prenant toujours soin de cacher les abus qu'il commettait sur ses victimes"", ont détaillé les procureurs.
Les hommes de loi ont continué : ""À l'heure d'aujourd'hui, même après le verdict du jury en sa défaveur, Kelly refuse d'endosser la responsabilité de ses crimes.""Les avocats de R. Kelly ont demandé à ce que ses deux condamnations soient faites en même temps : ""Il y a peu de chances qu'il récidive à 80 ans passés. La majorité de ses crimes ont été commis il y a un demi-siècle"", a lâché la défense du chanteur qui s'est d'ailleurs félicité quant à la nouvelle condamnation annoncée : ""Nous nous sentons bien. La peine était principalement concurrente. Une année supplémentaire a été ajoutée. Presque aucune restitution. Bon résultat.""
Des accusations très graves
Dans cette nouvelle affaire, R. Kelly a été accusé d'avoir abusé de 4 personnes, dont 3 mineures. Il a été reconnu coupable de 6 des 13 chefs d'accusation, le jury l'ayant condamné pour pornographie juvénile, mais l'acquittant des accusations de complot et d'incitation. Ainsi, R.

Singer R. Kelly Sentenced to One Additional Year on Federal Sex-crime Charges,"CHICAGO: Grammy-winning R&B artist R. Kelly was sentenced on Thursday to one additional year in prison on federal child pornography and other charges to be served on top of the 30 years he received on an earlier conviction in New York, local media reported.
At a 90-minute hearing, Judge Harry Leinenweber of the U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois in Chicago also ordered Kelly to serve 19 years simultaneously with the previous sentence, a local CBS affiliate and other media reported.
In September, Kelly was convicted in federal court of felony sexual exploitation of a child, enticement of a female, and possession of material containing child pornography.
In the earlier case in New York, Kelly was convicted of multiple felonies including illegal sex with minors and sexual exploitation of minors.
In Illinois, prosecutors argued that the singer was so incorrigible that “the only way to ensure Kelly does not re-offend is to impose a sentence that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life."" They want to add another 25 years to his existing 30-year sentence.
Defense attorneys said Kelly, who is 56 and suffers from diabetes, was already facing an effective life sentence with a 30-year term. They acknowledged that the judge must impose a sentence of 10 years, but contended that it should run concurrently.
They also questioned why federal prosecutors have dedicated significant resources to prosecuting a Black artist when, they argued, many of the biggest white stars in rock ‘n’ roll history had been accused of abusing underage girls, and “none have been prosecuted and none will die in prison.""
Defense lawyer Jennifer Bonjean alleged a double standard, naming 11 white rock stars in her sentencing memo who have been accused of abusing underage girls and have gone unpunished.
Kelly did not address the judge because he still faced prosecution in other jurisdictions and any statement could be used against him, Bonjean said.

R. Kelly Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison in Federal Child Pornography Case,"R. Kelly has been sentenced to 20 years in prison on federal child pornography charges, The Associated Press reports. Following Kelly’s September conviction, a federal court in Chicago ruled that he’ll serve 19 of those years concurrently with the 30-year sentence a New York judge handed down for Kelly’s sex trafficking and racketeering convictions last summer.
At the end of January, prosecutors in Cook County, Illinois dropped indictments against Kelly for state-level charges of aggravated sexual abuse. State’s Attorney Kim Foxx cited the “extensive sentences” of the federal cases, along with the need to allocate investigative resources to other, less high-profile cases.
Kelly is still facing state charges in Minnesota for allegedly engaging in prostitution with a minor. Along with his prison sentence for the New York charges, Kelly must pay $309,000 in restitution, which a judge ruled could be partially paid from his inmate commissary account.

Handed down in a courtroom in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago, the sentence means Kelly could make it out of prison alive, when he is about 80.
Prosecutors had asked Judge Harry Leinenweber to sentence him to 25 years – and to not let him begin serving those until after he completed the first 30-year sentence, imposed on him last year in New York.
“The nature of this offence is horrific,” Judge Leinenweber said in explaining the 20-year sentence. He noted that Kelly’s sexual abuse victims would suffer from his crimes for the rest of their lives.

At the same time, he accepted defence arguments that Kelly might not even make it to 80, so handing him a consecutive lengthy sentence, rather than allowing him to serve all but one year of it simultaneously, did not make much sense.
“He has a life expectancy of not a hell of a lot more,” the judge said. “He is 56 years of age.”
Kelly’s defence lawyer celebrated the ruling as a victory, and some of the singer’s fans could be heard cheering outside the courtroom.
Kelly remained still, his eyes downcast, as Judge Leinenweber explained what was at times a hard-to-follow sentence.
He did seem to show some emotion when a representative read a statement written by “Jane”, one of his accusers and a key prosecution witness.
“I was brainwashed by Robert and a sex slave,” Jane’s statement said. “It almost killed me.”
Kelly did not make a statement in court prior to the sentencing decision, heeding the advice of his lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, to stay quiet while they appeal both his Chicago and New York convictions.
“It’s the right outcome,” Ms Bonjean said. “The judge was reasonable. He, I think, took into account both sides and ultimately was fair.”

The US Attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, conceded that prosecutors were disappointed Kelly did nt receive more consecutive prison time.
But he added, “Twenty years is a significant sentence, and we are happy that that was imposed in this case.”
The judge said at the outset of the hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to woo underage girls for sex, a determination that was important in deciding whether to extend Kelly’s current term significantly.
“The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court.

“It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly)’. It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”
Two of Kelly’s accusers asked the judge to punish him harshly.
“When your virginity is taken by a paedophile at 14 – your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia”, addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly point out her alleged faults while he abused her.
“Now you are here – because there is something wrong with you,” she said. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”
Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly last year on six of 13 counts: three of producing child porn and three of enticement of minors for sex.
Prosecutors did not get a conviction on the marquee charge: that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Kelly rose from poverty in Chicago to become one of the world’s biggest R&B stars. Known for his smash hit I Believe I Can Fly and for sex-infused songs such as Bump n’ Grind, he sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.
Prosecutors described Kelly as “a serial sexual predator” who used his fame and wealth to reel in, sexually abuse and then discard star-struck fans.
US Assistant Attorney Jeannice Appenteng urged the judge to keep Kelly in prison “for the rest of his life”.
Kelly’s abuse of children was especially appalling, she said on Thursday, because he “memorialised” his abuse by filming victims, including Jane.
Ms Appenteng told the court Kelly “used Jane as a sex prop, a thing” for producing pornographic videos.
But Ms Bonjean has accused prosecutors of offering an “embellished narrative” to get the judge to join what she called the government’s “bloodthirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement”.
The singer has suffered enough, including financially, Ms Bonjean said. She said his worth once approached one billion US dollars (£840 million), but that he “is now destitute”.
Given his age and current 30-year sentence, Ms Bonjean said sentencing Kelly to 25 more years would be “overkill”.
“It is symbolic,” she said. “Why? Because it is R Kelly.”
Just before Kelly was taken back to detention on Thursday, he requested that he not be placed on suicide watch because constant checks by guards “is in and of itself cruel” and “creates mental health issues,” Ms Bonjean said.
“He was expecting this,” she told the judge. “Mr Kelly is not suicidal.”",2023-02-23T22:30:07Z,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk,Belfast Telegraph
R. Kelly condenado a 20 anos de prisão por crimes de pornografia infantil,"Um juiz de Chicago condenou, esta quinta-feira, R. Kelly a 20 anos de prisão por pornografia infantil e aliciamento de um menor, mas o antigo cantor irá cumprir a maior parte simultaneamente com uma pena anterior de 30 anos.
R. Kelly, de 56 anos, está já a cumprir uma pena de 30 anos de prisão, após um júri de Brooklyn, num julgamento federal separado, o ter condenado por extorsão e tráfico sexual.
O juiz Harry D. Leinenweber decretou agora que 19 anos de prisão seriam cumpridos em simultâneo com a pena anterior (a de 30 anos), com exceção de um ano.

O facto de Kelly passar no máximo 31 anos atrás das grades é uma vitória para a defesa, que considerou que ""uma sentença simultânea é o que a justiça exige"", acusando o Ministério Público de querer ""garantir que Kelly nunca veja a luz do dia.""
A advogada do antigo cantor de R&B, Jennifer Bonjean, informou que as duas condenações vão ser alvo de recurso.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, mais conhecido por R. Kelly, foi condenado em setembro de 2022 por três acusações de pornografia infantil e três de aliciamento de um menor.
O antigo cantor conhecido por sucessos como ""I Believe I Can Fly"" foi absolvido por um júri federal de sete outras acusações, incluindo a de que ele obstruiu a justiça num julgamento anterior.
Em 2021, Kelly foi condenado em Nova Iorque por recrutar sistematicamente adolescentes e mulheres para relações sexuais. Um veredicto que foi amplamente visto como um marco para o movimento #MeToo, uma vez que foi o primeiro grande julgamento de abuso sexual em que a maioria das vítimas eram mulheres negras.
Foi também a primeira vez que Kelly enfrentou consequências criminais pelo abuso que terá praticado durante décadas a mulheres e crianças.",2023-02-23T22:28:00Z,https://www.dn.pt,Diário de Notícias - Lisboa
R Kelly avoids lengthy add-on to 30-year prison sentence,"Kelly was sentenced on Thursday to 20 years in prison for child pornography and enticement of minors for sex but will serve all but one of those simultaneously with a 30-year sentence on racketeering and sex trafficking convictions.
US District Judge Harry Leinenweber ordered that Kelly serve one year in prison following the racketeering sentence, imposed last year in New York.
The central question going into the sentencing in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago was whether Leinenweber would order the 56-year-old Grammy Award winner to serve the sentence simultaneously with or only after he completes the New York term. The latter would have been tantamount to a life sentence.
Prosecutors had acknowledged that a lengthy term served only after the New York sentence could have erased any chance of Kelly ever getting out of prison alive. It’s what they asked for, arguing his crimes against children and lack of remorse justified it.
With Thursday’s sentence, though, Kelly will serve no more than 31 years.
That means he will be eligible for release at around age 80, providing him some hope of one day leaving prison alive.
Leinenweber said at the outset of the hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to woo underage girls for sex.

“The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court.
“It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly)’. … It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”Prosecutors say Kelly’s crimes against children and his lack of remorse justify the stiffer sentence. A calm Kelly spoke briefly at the start of the hearing, when the judge asked him if he had reviewed key presentencing documents for any inaccuracies.“Your honor, I have gone over it with my attorney,” Kelly said.
“I’m just relying on my attorney for that.”
Two of Kelly’s accusers asked the judge to punish him harshly. In a statement read aloud in court, a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane” said she had lost her early aspirations to become a singer herself and her hopes for fulfilling relationships.

“I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly,” the statement said. “I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly. … “I have been permanently scarred by Robert.”
The woman was a key witness for prosecutors during Kelly’s trial; four of his convictions are tied to her. “When your virginity is taken by a pedophile at 14 … your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia,” attended the hearing and addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly pick at her supposed faults while he abused her. “Now you are here … because there is something wrong with you,” she said.

In court Thursday, Bonjean said Kelly will be lucky to survive his 30-year New York sentence alone.
To give him a consecutive 25-year sentence on top of that “is overkill, it is symbolic,” she said. “Why? Because it is R. Kelly.”She also argued that Kelly’s silence should not be viewed as a lack of remorse. She said that while she advised Kelly not to speak because he continues to appeal his convictions and could face other legal action, “He would like to, he would like to very much.”",2023-02-23T22:10:43Z,https://indianexpress.com,The Indian Express
R. Kelly é condenado a 20 anos de prisão por abuso sexual,"São Paulo
O cantor e compositor R. Kelly foi sentenciado a 20 anos de prisão, nesta quinta-feira (23), por abuso sexual infantil. O júri do tribunal federal de Chicago, nos Estados Unidos, o considerou culpado por ter feito três vídeos nos quais ele abusa sexualmente da afilhada de 14 anos.
A sentença vem cinco meses após o artista ser condenado, por um júri de Nova York, a 30 anos de prisão por tráfico sexual e extorsão de menores.

O juiz Harry Leinenweber, de Chicago, determinou que R. Kelly vai cumprir, em prisão federal, 19 dos 20 anos do cárcere hoje definido simultaneamente à condenação anterior. Na prática, o parecer desta quinta acrescenta um ano a mais de prisão para o artista.
Em Chicago, o cantor e compositor de 56 anos foi considerado culpado em seis das 13 acusações feitas contra ele, todas ocorridas na década de 1990.
Os procuradores haviam pedido 25 anos de prisão para o cantor e compositor alegando que ele representa um ""perigo para a sociedade"" e que o abuso sexual de menores praticado por R. Kelly foi ""intencional e prolífico"".
A advogada do artista, Jennifer Bonjean, pediu que a sentença fosse de aproximadamente uma década e que fosse cumprida com a de Nova York.
""Não importa o que eu faça, o sr. Kelly não vai sair [da cadeia] pelos próximos dez ou 20 anos"", afirmou Leinenweber. ""Uma das coisas que nós deveríamos ter em mente é que ele tem 56 anos e, como Bonjean apontou, a expectativa de vida dele não é grande coisa.""
No processo judicial, a advogada de R. Kelly argumentou que a sentença de Nova York já era equivalente a uma prisão perpétua. ""Ele teria que desafiar todas as probabilidades estatísticas para sair vivo da prisão"", ela argumentou.

R. Kelly: Νέα καταδίκη για βιασμό της ανήλικης βαφτιστήρας του - Επιπλέον 20 χρόνια,"«Να θυμάστε ότι είναι 56 ετών. Και το προσδόκιμο ζωής του δεν είναι πολύ περισσότερο», είπε ο δικαστής
Ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο στο Σικάγο καταδίκασε τον R. Kelly σε επιπλέον χρόνο φυλάκισης των 30 ετών που περνάει στη φυλακή λόγω προηγούμενης καταδίκης.
Ο 56χρονος τραγουδιστής του «I Believe I Can Fly», καταδικάστηκε σε 20 χρόνια φυλάκισης αφού κρίθηκε ένοχος για τρεις κατηγορίες παραγωγής παιδικής πορνογραφίας και τρεις κατηγορίες παρακίνησης ανηλίκου σε εγκληματική σεξουαλική δραστηριότητα.
Ωστόσο, ο δικαστής είπε ότι μπορεί να εκτίσει τα 19 από αυτά τα χρόνια ταυτόχρονα με την ποινή που εκτίει αυτή τη στιγμή στη Νέα Υόρκη.
Αφού ολοκληρώσει την ποινή του για την καταδίκη του στη Νέα Υόρκη, πρέπει να εκτίσει ένα ακόμη έτος για την καταδίκη του στο Σικάγο.
«Ό,τι κι αν γίνει, ο κύριος Kelly δεν πρόκειται να βγει από την πόρτα μετά τη σημερινή ημέρα», δήλωσε ο δικαστής Harry Leinenweber, σύμφωνα με τους Chicago Sun-Times.
«Δεν θα βγει τα επόμενα 10 χρόνια, δεν θα βγει τα επόμενα 20 χρόνια. Να θυμάστε ότι είναι 56 ετών. Και όπως τονίζει η [η δικηγόρος του Jennifer] Bonjean, το προσδόκιμο ζωής του δεν είναι πολύ περισσότερο - οκτώ, δέκα χρόνια», πρόσθεσε.
Η Bonjean λέει ότι σκοπεύει να ασκήσει έφεση κατά της ποινής, η οποία έρχεται πέντε μήνες αφότου κρίθηκε ένοχος για διάφορα σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα.
Κατά τη διάρκεια της δίκης, οι ένορκοι παρακολούθησαν αποσπάσματα από διάφορα βίντεο με τον Kelly να κακοποιεί σεξουαλικά ένα ανήλικο κορίτσι, το οποίο ήταν βαφτιστήρα του.
Το κορίτσι, το οποίο κατά τη διάρκεια της δίκης χρησιμοποιούσε το όνομα Jane, δήλωσε ότι ο Kelly άρχισε να την κακοποιεί σεξουαλικά όταν ήταν μόλις 14 ετών. Όταν έγινε 15 ετών, είπε στους ενόρκους, άρχισαν να έχουν σεξουαλική επαφή «αμέτρητες φορές».
Τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2021, ο Kelly κρίθηκε ένοχος και για τις εννέα κατηγορίες που τον βάρυναν και τον επόμενο Ιούνιο καταδικάστηκε σε 30 χρόνια φυλάκισης για τα εγκλήματα.",2023-02-23T21:05:40Z,https://www.lifo.gr,LiFO mobile

Violences sexuelles
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 56 ans, avait été reconnu coupable par un jury fédéral de Chicago de production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur. Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur des jeunes filles, dont l’une n’avait que 14 ans, avaient été diffusés pendant le procès.
Le chanteur avait en revanche été acquitté pour des accusations d’obstruction à la justice. Il lui était reproché d’avoir perturbé le déroulement d’un précédent procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, dont il était ressorti non coupable, en menaçant une victime pour qu’elle ne témoigne pas.
L’artiste, mondialement connu pour son tube « I Believe I Can Fly » et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, avait longtemps régné sur le R&B malgré des soupçons d’agressions sexuelles.

Cântăreţul în vârstă de 56 de ani, cunoscut în întreaga lume pentru hitul său „I Believe I Can Fly” şi pentru cele 75 de milioane de discuri vândute, a fost găsit vinovat în septembrie anul trecut. El a fost însă achitat de alte acuzaţii de obstrucţionare a justiţiei. O cerere pentru un nou proces a fost respinsă.
Robert Kelly este un prădător sexual în serie care, de-a lungul anilor, a vizat femeile tinere, având mereu grijă să ascundă abuzurile pe care le comite asupra victimelor sale”, au spus procurorii. „Astăzi, chiar şi după verdictul juriului împotriva sa, Kelly refuză să-şi asume responsabilitatea pentru infracţiunile sale”.
Apărarea a cerut ca cele două pedepse ale sale să fie ispăşite în acelaşi timp, şi nu consecutiv, pentru că R. Kelly să îşi poată sfârşi viaţa în afara închisorii. „Sunt puţine şanse ca el să recidiveze la vârsta de 80 de ani”, au insistat avocaţii săi. „Majoritatea infracţiunilor sale au fost comise acum o jumătate de secol”.

Μάλιστα το δικαστήριο περιέγραψε τον ράπερ ως ένα κατά συρροή σεξουαλικό αρπακτικό που «στόχευε σε νεαρά κορίτσια και έκανε διάφορα για να κρύψει την κακοποίησή τους».
Οι εισαγγελείς αναφέρουν επίσης ότι μέχρι και σήμερα, ακόμα και μετά την ετυμηγορία των ενόρκων εναντίον του, ο Κέλι αρνείται τις κατηγορίες. Σημειώνεται ότι τον περασμένο Ιούνιο στον ράπερ είχε επιβληθεί ποινή 30 ετών από ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο της Νέας Υόρκης, για εκβιασμούς, σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση και μαστροπεία.
Ο R. Kelly είναι ένας από τους πιο διάσημους καλλιτέχνες που καταδικάστηκαν για σεξουαλικής φύσεως αδικήματα κατά τη διάρκεια των μεγάλων αποκαλύψεων του κινήματος MeToo.
Η δίκη για τα σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα σε βάρος ανηλίκων ξεκίνησε τον Ιανουάριο και οι εισαγγελείς τον κατηγόρησαν για την βιντεοσκόπηση σεξουαλικών επαφών με ανήλικους, ενώ μαρτυρίες στην δικαστική αίθουσα σόκαραν, ειδικά από την 37χρονη σήμερα βαφτιστήρα του, η οποία ισχυρίστηκε πως ο τραγουδιστής είχε σεξουαλικές επαφές μαζί της εκατοντάδες φορές, όπως χαρακτηριστικά είπε, πριν εκείνη ενηλικιωθεί, ενώ όπως είπε η πρώτη φορά που είχαν ερωτική επαφή ήταν στα 15 της χρόνια.
Μάλιστα η 37χρονη Τζέιν κατήγγειλε ότι ο R. Kelly την εξανάγκαζε να προβεί σε ερωτικές περιπτύξεις μαζί του, ενώ ανέφερε ότι είχε ερωτικό βίντεο με εκείνην. Ο τραγουδιστής δεν δίστασε να χρηματίσει την κοπέλα για να μην διακινδυνεύσει την φήμη του εάν η κασέτα χανόταν από εκείνον και να μπορέσει να ισχυριστεί ότι επρόκειτο για μία ιερόδουλη που συνάντηση τυχαία.
«Σε περίπτωση που κάποιος έβλεπε την κασέτα ή αν κυκλοφορούσε για τον οποιοδήποτε λόγο, θα έλεγε ότι είμαι πόρνη» κατέθεσε η 37χρονη ενώπιον του Δικαστηρίου.
Επίσης, η βαφτιστήρα του τραγουδιστή σημείωσε ότι οι ερωτικές επαφές μεταξύ τους διήρκησαν μόνο μέχρι να κλείσει τα 18. Για την πρώτη φορά που την άγγιξε ο τραγουδιστής ανέφερε στην κατάθεσή της πως έγινε όταν εκείνος ήταν 30 ετών, σε ένα στούντιο ηχογράφησης στο Σικάγο και έπειτα άρχισε να την καλεί πολύ συχνά στο σπίτι του στο North Side.
Σοκαριστική ήταν η αποκάλυψή της ότι στις συναντήσεις τους, αρκετές φορές, βρίσκονταν και άλλες έφηβες κοπέλες, τις οποίες μάλιστα της είχε πει εκείνος να βρίσκει και να πηγαίνει στο σπίτι του.",2023-02-23T20:20:00Z,https://www.cnn.gr,CNN Greece

Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur des jeunes filles, dont l’une n’avait que 14 ans, avaient été diffusés pendant le procès.
Le chanteur avait en revanche été acquitté pour des accusations d’obstruction à la justice. Il lui était reproché d’avoir perturbé le déroulement d’un précédent procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, dont il était ressorti non coupable, en menaçant une victime pour qu’elle ne témoigne pas.
L’artiste, mondialement connu pour son tube «I Believe I Can Fly» et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, avait longtemps régné sur le R&B, malgré des soupçons d’agressions sexuelles. Il avait finalement été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 d’avoir piloté pendant des années un «système» d’exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes, et condamné en juin dernier à 30 ans de prison par un tribunal fédéral à New York.",2023-02-23T20:03:38Z,https://www.lematin.ch,Le Matin
Nur Bruchteil für Haft relevant: R. Kelly kassiert weiteres Urteil von 20 Jahren,"Diese Audioversion wurde künstlich generiert. Mehr Informationen zu unserer Vorlesefunktion finden Sie hier . Wir freuen uns über Ihr Feedback zu diesem Angebot.
Der ehemalige Musikstar ist längst verurteilt. Nun ist das Strafmaß in einem weiteren Prozess um Kinderpornografie und Kindesmissbrauch verkündet worden. Es lautet auf 20 Jahre, stellt aber einen juristischen Erfolg für den Sexualstraftäter dar. Verbüßen wird er nur ein zusätzliches Jahr.
Der ehemalige Musikstar R. Kelly ist von einem Gericht in Chicago zu einer Gefängnisstrafe von 20 Jahren verurteilt worden. Das berichteten mehrere US-Medien übereinstimmend, darunter die ""New York Times"". Das Urteil stellt jedoch einen juristischen Erfolg für Kelly dar. Denn der 56-Jährige wird lediglich ein zusätzliches Jahr hinter Gittern verbringen. Die restlichen 19 Jahre Haftzeit werden an die 30-jährige Haftstrafe angerechnet, zu der Kelly bereits im Juni 2022 in New York verurteilt worden war.
Richter Harry Leinenweber entschied damit weitestgehend gegen den Antrag der Staatsanwaltschaft, die gefordert hatte, dass Kelly beide Strafen hintereinander und nicht größtenteils gleichzeitig verbüßen soll. ""Der einzige Weg sicherzustellen, dass [Kelly] nicht rückfällig werden wird, ist eine Strafe zu verhängen, durch die er für den Rest seines Lebens im Gefängnis bleibt"", hatte Staatsanwältin Jeannice Williams Appenteng vor der Strafmaßverkündung im Gerichtssaal dargelegt. Kelly habe in dem Prozess auch keine Reue für seine Taten gezeigt. Die Verteidigung hatte dagegen argumentiert, dass der Ex-Popstar ""wahrscheinlich in beiden Fällen im Gefängnis sterben"" wird.
In dem Prozess in Chicago war Kelly im September letzten Jahres für schuldig befunden worden, Kinderpornografie angefertigt und Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt zu haben, darunter seine zum Tatzeitpunkt 14-jährige Patentochter. Auch in dem vorherigen Prozess in New York wurde er im Zusammenhang mit Vorwürfen verurteilt, nach denen er Minderjährige ausgebeutet und missbraucht haben soll.
Die New Yorker Staatsanwaltschaft hatte laut ""Billboard"" erklärt: ""Einfach ausgedrückt, die Verbrechen des Angeklagten waren kalkuliert, methodisch und Teil eines langjährigen Musters, seine Plattform als Mega-Star und sein tiefgreifendes Netzwerk zu nutzen, um Zugang zu Teenagern zu erhalten, von denen viele besonders verwundbar waren, und diese dann auszunutzen für seinen persönlichen Vorteil und seine sexuelle Befriedigung"".",2023-02-23T20:02:28Z,https://www.n-tv.de,n-tv NACHRICHTEN

R. Kelly: Ποινή φυλάκισης 20 χρόνων για σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα σε βάρος ανηλίκων,"ΗΠΑ: Σοκάρουν οι λεπτομέρειες για τους εκβιασμούς και τις ερωτικές περιπτύξεις στις οποίες ανάγκαζε την ανήλικη τότε βαφτιστήρα του ο γνωστός ράπερ R. Kelly
Ποινή φυλάκισης 20 ετών για σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα σε βάρος ανηλίκων επέβαλε το Ομοσπονδιακό Δικαστήριο του Σικάγο στον ράπερ R. Kelly, για υπόθεση παιδικής πορνογραφίας και αποπλάνησης ανηλίκου αναφορικά με την βαφτισιμιά του.
Μάλιστα το δικαστήριο περιέγραψε τον ράπερ ώς ένα κατά συρροή σεξουαλικό αρπακτικό που «στόχευε σε νεαρά κορίτσια και έκανε διάφορα για να κρύψει την κακοποίησή τους».

Σημειώνεται ότι τον περασμένο Ιούνιο στον ράπερ είχε επιβληθεί ποινή 30 ετών απο ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο της Νέας Υόρκης, για εκβιασμούς, σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση και μαστροπεία.
Ο R. Kelly είναι ένας από τους πιο διάσημους καλλιτέχνες που καταδικάστηκαν για σεξουαλικής φύσεως αδικήματα κατά τη διάρκεια των μεγάλων αποκαλύψεων του κινήματος MeToo.
Η δίκη για τα σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα σε βάρος ανηλίκων ξεκίνησε τον Ιανουαρίο και οι εισαγγελείς τον κατηγόρησαν για την βιντεοσκόπηση σεξουαλικών επαφών με ανήλικους, ενώ μαρτυρίες στην δικαστική αίθουσα σόκαραν, ειδικά από την 37χρονη σήμερα βαφτιστήρα του, η οποία ισχυρίστηκε πως ο τραγουδιστής είχε σεξουαλικές επαφές μαζί της εκατοντάδες φορές, όπως χαρακτηριστικά είπε, πριν εκείνη ενηλικιωθεί, ενώ όπως είπε η πρώτη φορά που είχαν ερωτική επαφή ήταν στα 15 της χρόνια.
Μάλιστα η 37χρονη Τζέιν κατήγγειλε ότι ο R. Kelly την εξανάγκαζε να προβεί σε ερωτικές περιπτύξεις μαζί το, ενώ ανέφερε ότι είχε ερωτικό βίντεο με εκείνην.
Ο τραγουδιστής δεν δίστασε να χρηματίσει την κοπέλα για να μην διακινδυνεύσει την φήμη του εάν η κασέτα χανόταν από εκείνον και να μπορέσει να ισχυριστεί ότι επρόκειτο για μία ιερόδουλη που συνάντηση τυχαία.

«Σε περίπτωση που κάποιος έβλεπε την κασέτα ή αν κυκλοφορούσε για τον οποιοδήποτε λόγο, θα έλεγε ότι είμαι πόρνη» κατέθεσε η 37χρονη ενώπιον του Δικαστηρίου.
Επίσης, η βαφτιστήρα του τραγουδιστή σημείωσε ότι οι ερωτικές επαφές μεταξύ τους διήρκησαν μόνο μέχρι να κλείσει τα 18.
Για την πρώτη φορά που την άγγιξε ο τραγουδιστής ανέφερε στην κατάθεσή της πως έγινε όταν εκείνος ήταν 30 ετών, σε ένα στούντιο ηχογράφησης στο Σικάγο και έπειτα άρχισε να την καλεί πολύ συχνά στο σπίτι του στο North Side.
Σοκαριστική ήταν η αποκάλυψή της ότι στις συναντήσεις τους, αρκετές φορές, βρίσκονταν και άλλες έφηβες κοπέλες, τις οποίες μάλιστα της είχε πει εκείνος να βρίσκει και να πηγαίνει στο σπίτι του.",2023-02-23T19:57:52Z,https://www.newsbomb.gr,Newsbomb.gr

Pédopornographie: le chanteur R. Kelly condamné à 20 ans de prison,"La Cour suprême s'est penchée mardi sur l'épineuse question de la responsabilité des grandes plateformes comme Google ou Facebook sur les contenus publiés par les utilisateurs. Elle n'a pas indiqué clairement si elle pense que la loi doit être réécrite ou non.
""Nous sommes dans une situation délicate, parce que ce texte a été écrit à une autre époque, quand internet était complètement différent"", a résumé la juge à la Cour Suprême des Etats-Unis Elena Kagan.
L'audience portait sur une loi de 1996, connue sous le nom de ""Section 230"", assurant l'immunité judiciaire des entreprises numériques qui, contrairement aux ""éditeurs"", ""hébergent"" des contenus mis en ligne par les utilisateurs de leurs plateformes.
Mais de nombreuses voix réclament depuis des années que cette loi soit modifiée ou retirée, considérant que Google, YouTube, Facebook ou Twitter devraient être tenus responsables quand ils facilitent la propagation de contenus dits ""problématiques"" pouvant avoir de graves répercussions dans la vie réelle.
Plainte
Les neuf juges de l'instance se sont saisis d'une plainte déposée par les proches de Nohemi Gonzalez, une jeune Américaine tuée dans les attentats de novembre 2015 à Paris, contre Google, la maison mère de Youtube.
Ils lui reprochent d'avoir soutenu la croissance du groupe Etat islamique (EI) en suggérant ses vidéos à certains usagers.
Leur plainte a jusqu'ici été rejetée par les tribunaux au nom de la section 230. Mais dans leur recours à la Cour Suprême, ils estiment que Google n'est pas un ""éditeur"" protégé par ce dispositif puisque les algorithmes qu'il a créés ont ""recommandé"" les vidéos de l'EI.
""Mourir à petit feu""
""Quand vous cliquez sur une vidéo, YouTube vous en propose systématiquement d'autres que vous n'avez pas demandées"", a indiqué Eric Schnapper, au nom de la famille Gonzalez.
Mais selon Lisa Blatt, qui a représenté Google mardi, le terme ""recommandation"" est abusif.
""Il y a 3,5 milliards de requêtes sur le moteur de recherche tous les jours. (Les réponses) sont différentes pour chaque personne et pourraient toutes être considérées comme des recommandations"", a assené l'avocate.
""Internet n'aurait jamais décollé si tout le monde pouvait intenter des procès tout le temps"", a-t-elle continué. ""Le web mourrait à petit feu"".
L'idée des parlementaires dans les années 1990 était en effet de protéger le secteur alors embryonnaire de poursuites en cascade, pour lui permettre de s'épanouir, tout en l'encourageant à retirer les contenus problématiques.
Mais cette disposition ne fait plus consensus: la gauche reproche aux réseaux sociaux de s'abriter derrière cette immunité pour laisser fleurir des messages racistes et complotistes; la droite, outrée par le bannissement de Donald Trump de plusieurs plateformes, les accuse de ""censure"" sous couvert de leur droit à la modération.
Compte tenu de ces perspectives divergentes, les efforts législatifs pour amender le texte n'ont jamais abouti.
En acceptant de se saisir du dossier, alors qu'elle écarte l'immense majorité des dossiers qui lui sont soumis, la haute juridiction a laissé entendre qu'elle était prête à faire évoluer la jurisprudence.
""Pas les plus grands experts""
Les juges ont exprimé leurs doutes quant à la validité de la Section 230 aujourd'hui, mais aussi leur frustration face à un sujet complexe, alors que l'intelligence artificielle a encore fait un bond ces derniers mois avec des interfaces comme ChatGPT.
""Dans un monde post-algorithmique, l'IA peut générer des contenus, y compris en suivant des règles neutres. Elle peut générer de la poésie, elle peut générer des polémiques"", a lancé le juge Neil Gorsuch.
""Vous n'avez pas ici les neuf plus grands experts d'internet"", a noté Elena Kagan, suscitant le rire de l'assemblée.
""Si jamais nous prenons votre parti, tout d'un coup Google n'est plus protégé. Et peut-être que c'est ce que veut le Congrès, mais n'est-ce pas au Congrès d'en décider plutôt qu'à cette cour ?"", a-t-elle souligné.
Sueurs froides
Changer la jurisprudence pourrait ""faire s'effondrer l'économie numérique, avec toutes sortes de conséquences pour les travailleurs et les fonds de pensions etc"", a de son côté noté le juge John Roberts, en référence à l'argumentaire joint au dossier de Google.
La perspective suscite des sueurs froides dans le monde de la tech.
Mercredi, le temple du droit américain poursuivra sa réflexion avec un dossier très proche: si la section 230 n'existait pas, les plateformes pourraient-elles être condamnées en vertu des lois antiterroristes, même sans soutien direct à un attentat?
La cour doit rendre les deux décisions avant le 30 juin.

R. Kelly é condenado a 20 anos de prisão por pornografia infantil,"O cantor e compositor R. Kelly foi condenado a 20 anos de prisão em caso referente à pornografia infantil e a abuso de menor de idade. De acordo com a Variety, ele foi considerado culpado em seis das 13 acusações, todas de 2019, incluindo coersão de menores a atividade sexual e produção de sex tapes envolvendo menores.
Uma das vítimas foi sua afilhada de 14 anos. O tribunal federal em Chicago descobriu que o músico produzira três vídeos abusando dela. Mas ele foi absolvido da acusação de obstrução de justiça deste caso.
Em 2021, R. Kelly já fora condenado a 30 anos em Nova York, por extorsão e tráfico sexual. Embora os promotores tenham pedido que a nova condenação fosse adicionada à pena já existente, o juiz determinou que todos os anos com exceção de um serão cumpridos simultaneamente. Assim, tecnicamente, o músico evita a prisão perpétua.
Já são quase três décadas de acusações de teor sexual contra R. Kelly. Parte do histórico criminoso do músico deu origem ao documentário Surviving R. Kelly.

Nouvelle peine de 20 ans de prison pour R. Kelly,"(New York) Le chanteur américain R. Kelly, star déchue du R & B déjà condamnée à 30 ans de prison pour crimes sexuels, a écopé jeudi d’une peine de 20 ans de prison pour pédopornographie dans une autre affaire, devant une cour fédérale de Chicago.
Agence France-Presse
Cette peine ne s’additionnera pas à la précédente, le juge Harry Leinenweber ayant ordonné qu’il n’exécute qu’un an de prison supplémentaire quand il aura purgé sa condamnation à 30 ans de détention prononcée à New York en juin dernier.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 56 ans, avait été reconnu coupable par un jury fédéral de Chicago de production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur.
Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur des jeunes filles, dont l’une n’avait que 14 ans, avaient été diffusés pendant le procès.

L’artiste, mondialement connu pour son tube I Believe I Can Fly et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, avait longtemps régné sur le R & B malgré des soupçons d’agressions sexuelles.
Il avait finalement été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 d’avoir piloté pendant des années un « système » d’exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes, et condamné en juin dernier à 30 ans de prison par un tribunal fédéral à New York.",2023-02-23T19:37:46Z,https://www.lapresse.ca,La Presse
R Kelly ordered to serve extra year for child sex offences on top of 30-year sentence,"A US FEDERAL judge has handed singer R Kelly a 20-year prison sentence for his convictions of child sex abuse images and the enticement of minors for sex, but said he will serve nearly all of the sentence simultaneously with a 30-year sentence imposed last year on racketeering charges.
US District Judge Harry Leinenweber also ordered that Kelly serve one year in prison following his New York sentence.
The central question going into the sentencing in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago was whether Leinenweber would order that the 56-year-old serve the sentence simultaneously with or only after he completes the New York term for 2021 racketeering and sex trafficking convictions. The latter would have been tantamount to a life sentence.
Prosecutors had acknowledged that a lengthy term served only after the New York sentence could have erased any chance of Kelly ever getting out of prison alive.
It’s what they asked for, arguing his crimes against children and lack of remorse justified it.
With today’s sentence, though, Kelly will serve no more than 31 years. That means he will be eligible for release at around age 80, providing him some hope of one day leaving prison alive.
In a statement read aloud in court, a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane” said she had lost her early aspirations to become a singer herself and her hopes for fulfilling relationships.
“I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly,” the statement said. “I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly. I have been permanently scarred by Robert.”
The woman was a key witness for prosecutors during Kelly’s trial; four of his convictions are tied to her.
“When your virginity is taken by a paedophile at 14 – your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.

Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia”, attended the hearing and addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly pick at her supposed faults while he abused her.
“Now you are here – because there is something wrong with you,” she said. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”
Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly last year on six of 13 counts: three counts of producing child sex abuse images and three of enticement of minors for sex.
Known for his smash hit I Believe I Can Fly and for sex-infused songs such as Bump n’ Grind, Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.
In pre sentencing filings, prosecutors described Kelly as “a serial sexual predator” who used his fame and wealth to reel in, sexually abuse and then discard star-struck fans.
US Assistant Attorney Jeannice Appenteng today urged the judge to set a longer sentence and keep Kelly in prison “for the rest of his life”.
Kelly’s abuse of children was all the worse, she said, because he “memorialised” his abuse by filming victims, including Jane. She told the court Kelly “used Jane as a sex prop, a thing” for producing pornographic videos.
In prehearing filings, Kelly’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, accused prosecutors of offering an “embellished narrative” in an attempt to get the judge to join what she called the government’s “bloodthirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement”.
Bonjean said Kelly has suffered enough, including financially. She said his worth once approached one billion US dollars (€944 million), but that he “is now destitute”.
In court today, Bonjean said Kelly will be lucky to survive his 30-year New York sentence alone. To give him a consecutive 25-year sentence on top of that “is overkill, it is symbolic,” she said. “Why? Because it is R Kelly.”
She also argued that Kelly’s silence should not be viewed as a lack of remorse.
She said that while she advised Kelly not to speak because he continues to appeal his convictions and could face other legal action, “He would like to, he would like to very much.”",2023-02-23T19:33:47Z,https://www.thejournal.ie,TheJournal.ie

R Kelly handed 20 years for sex crimes to serve simultaneously with other 30-year prison sentence,"US district judge Harry Leinenweber also ordered that R Kelly serve one year in prison following his New York sentence. Photograph: AP/Matt Marton
A federal judge in the US on Thursday handed singer R Kelly a 20-year prison sentence for his convictions relating to child abuse imagery and the enticement of minors for sex but said he will serve nearly all of the sentence simultaneously with a 30-year sentence imposed last year on racketeering charges.
US district judge Harry Leinenweber also ordered that Kelly serve one year in prison following his New York sentence.
The central question going into the sentencing in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago was whether Leinenweber would order that the 56-year-old serve the sentence simultaneously with or only after he completes the New York term for 2021 racketeering and sex trafficking convictions. The latter would have been tantamount to a life sentence.
Prosecutors had acknowledged that a lengthy term served only after the New York sentence could have erased any chance of Kelly ever getting out of prison alive.

It’s what they asked for, arguing his crimes against children and lack of remorse justified it.
With Thursday’s sentencing, though, Kelly will serve no more than 31 years. That means he will be eligible for release at around age 80..
In a statement read aloud in court, a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane” said she had lost her early aspirations to become a singer herself and her hopes for fulfilling relationships.
“I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly,” the statement said. “I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly. I have been permanently scarred by Robert.”
The woman was a key witness for prosecutors during Kelly’s trial; four of his convictions are tied to her.
“When your virginity is taken by a paedophile at 14 – your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia”, attended the hearing and addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly pick at her supposed faults while he abused her.
“Now you are here – because there is something wrong with you,” she said. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”
Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly last year on six of 13 counts: three counts of producing child abuse imagery and three of enticement of minors for sex.
Kelly rose from poverty in Chicago to become one of the world’s biggest R&B stars. Known for his smash hit I Believe I Can Fly and for sex-infused songs such as Bump n’ Grind, he sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.
In presentencing filings, prosecutors described Kelly as “a serial sexual predator” who used his fame and wealth to reel in, sexually abuse and then discard star-struck fans.
US assistant attorney Jeannice Appenteng on Thursday urged the judge to set a longer sentence and keep Kelly in prison “for the rest of his life”.
Kelly’s abuse of children was all the worse, she said, because he “memorialised” his abuse by filming victims, including Jane. She told the court Kelly “used Jane as a sex prop, a thing” for producing videos.
In prehearing filings, Kelly’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, accused prosecutors of offering an “embellished narrative” in an attempt to get the judge to join what she called the government’s “bloodthirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement”.
Ms Bonjean said Kelly has suffered enough, including financially. She said his worth once approached $1 billion (€944 million), but that he “is now destitute”.
In court on Thursday, Ms Bonjean said Kelly will be lucky to survive his 30-year New York sentence alone. To give him a consecutive 25-year sentence on top of that “is overkill, it is symbolic,” she said. “Why? Because it is R Kelly,” she said.
She also argued that Kelly’s silence should not be viewed as a lack of remorse.
She said that while she advised Kelly not to speak because he continues to appeal his convictions and could face other legal action. “He would like to, he would like to very much.” – AP",2023-02-23T19:20:00Z,https://www.irishtimes.com,The Irish Times

R. Kelly: Καταδικάστηκε σε 20 χρόνια φυλάκισης για βιασμό ανηλίκων,"Σε 20 χρόνια φυλάκιση για σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα παιδιών καταδικάστηκε ο γνωστός τραγουδιστής R. Kelly.
Το δικαστήριο διαπίστωσε ότι είχε δημιουργήσει τρία βίντεο με τον εαυτό του να κακοποιεί σεξουαλικά τη 14χρονη βαφτιστήρα του.
Ο δικαστής έκρινε ότι όλη η ποινή φυλάκισης εκτός από ένα χρόνο θα εκτιζόταν ταυτόχρονα με την προηγούμενη ποινή 30 ετών που έλαβε ο R Kelly.
Το δικαστήριο στο Σικάγο καταδίκασε τον R Kelly για έξι από τις 13 κατηγορίες που του ασκήθηκαν σε σχέση με σεξουαλική κακοποίηση κατά τη διάρκεια της δεκαετίας του 1990, συμπεριλαμβανομένων τριών κατηγοριών για εξαναγκασμό ανηλίκων σε σεξουαλική δραστηριότητα και τρεις για παραγωγή σεξουαλικών ταινιών με ανήλικο.
Αθωώθηκε από την κατηγορία ότι είχε προσπαθήσει να εμποδίσει μια προηγούμενη έρευνα σχετικά με την κακοποίηση της βαφτιστήρας του, καθώς και δύο άλλες κατηγορίες για δελεασμό ανηλίκων να κάνουν σεξ.
Χωρίς τύψεις
Οι ομοσπονδιακοί εισαγγελείς είχαν υποστηρίξει ότι ο R Kelly άξιζε 25 χρόνια φυλάκισης πέρα ​​από την προηγούμενη ποινή του, αναφέροντας την «έλλειψη τύψεων» του τραγουδιστή ως λόγο ότι θα αποτελούσε κίνδυνο για την κοινωνία εάν αποφυλακιζόταν.
«Ο μόνος τρόπος για να διασφαλιστεί ότι δεν θα επαναλάβει το έγκλημα είναι να του επιβληθεί ποινή που θα τον κρατήσει στη φυλακή για το υπόλοιπο της ζωής του», δήλωσε η εισαγγελέας.
Μια δικηγόρος του R. Kelly, η Jennifer Bonjean, υποστήριξε ότι ο πελάτης της «είναι πιθανό να πεθάνει στη φυλακή ούτως ή άλλως, αλλά ότι αν δεν το έκανε, δεν θα αποτελούσε απειλή σε μεγάλη ηλικία.

"El cantante R. Kelly, condenado a 20 años por delitos sexuales contra menores","Un juez federal de Chicago ha condenado este jueves al cantante R. Kelly a 20 años de prisión por delitos de pornografía infantil y seducción de menores con fines sexuales. Sin embargo, Kelly cumplirá la mayor parte de esa condena simultáneamente con otra de 30 años impuesta el año pasado por cargos de asociación ilícita y tráfico sexual. En una importante victoria para la defensa, el juez de distrito Harry Leinenweber ha dicho que el cantante, de 56 años, solo tendrá que cumplir un año más después de que termine su condena de tres décadas en Nueva York.
Hace una semana, los fiscales solicitaron Kelly -cuyo nombre completo es Robert Sylvester Kelly- recibiera una nueva condena de 25 años que debería cumplir una vez que cumpliese íntegramente su condena de 30 años en Nueva York. En su recomendación de sentencia al Tribunal de Distrito de EE UU en Chicago, los fiscales describieron el comportamiento de Kelly como “sádico”, llamándolo “un depredador sexual en serie” sin remordimientos y que “representa un grave peligro para la sociedad”. “La única forma de garantizar que Kelly no reincida es imponerle una condena que le mantenga en prisión el resto de su vida”, argumentaron.
Por su parte, la defensa del cantante pidió una sentencia mucho más corta, de unos 10 años, y que se podría cumplir simultáneamente con la de Nueva York. Su abogada, Jennifer Bonjean, dijo el jueves que Kelly tendrá suerte si sobrevive solo a su condena de 30 años en Nueva York. Imponerle una condena consecutiva de 25 años como pedía la fiscalía hubiese sido algo “exagerado”, “simbólico”, dijo. “¿Por qué? Porque es R. Kelly”.
En la recomendación de sentencia de la defensa, Bonjean acusó a la fiscalía y a “la sociedad en general” de señalar a Kelly, que es negro, por comportamientos por los que “homólogos blancos” han salido impunes. “Ninguno ha sido procesado y ninguno morirá en prisión”, escribió la abogada. El equipo jurídico de Kelly ha recurrido sus condenas de Nueva York y Chicago.
En el juicio celebrado en Chicago en septiembre del año pasado, el jurado condenó al cantante de R&B por seis de los trece cargos que se le imputaban. Fue declarado culpable de tres cargos de pornografía infantil y tres cargos de seducción de menores con fines sexuales, pero fue absuelto de otros siete cargos que incluían obstrucción a la justicia y conspiración para recibir pornografía infantil. En Chicago, estado natal de Kelly, una condena por un solo cargo de pornografía infantil conlleva una pena mínima obligatoria de 10 años. Su condena se consideró un hito importante para el movimiento #MeToo en Estados Unidos.
Las acusaciones contra Kelly se remontan a principios de la década del 2000. En 2002, el periodista musical Jim DeRogatis, del Chicago Sun-Times, publicó una noticia en la que revelaba que había recibido una cinta de vídeo anónima en la que supuestamente se veía a Kelly manteniendo relaciones sexuales con una niña de 14 años. El periodista también publicó que la policía de Chicago llevaba tres años investigando las acusaciones sobre Kelly y la misma niña. En aquel momento, la niña y sus padres negaron que la niña mantuviera relaciones sexuales con Kelly y que ella fuera la chica en la grabación. Un año después, Kelly fue acusado en Chicago de pornografía infantil en relación con el vídeo. Sin embargo, cuando el caso fue a juicio en 2008, el cantante fue absuelto.

Pero la víctima ―conocida por el seudónimo de Jane― mantuvo una relación con el artista durante años. Decidió contar su historia tras ver el documental Surviving R. Kelly, emitido en 2019, que incluía el testimonio de varias mujeres que acusaban al cantante de abusos sexuales desde los años noventa. En el juicio de Chicago del año pasado, Jane dijo públicamente por primera vez que ella era la niña de aquel vídeo sexual. Dijo que tenía 14 años en la grabación y que el hombre era Kelly, que entonces tendría unos 30 años. Admitió que mintió cuando la existencia de la cinta se dio a conocer porque estaba “avergonzada”: “Tampoco quería que esa persona fuera yo”.
Kelly fue una de las mayores estrellas del R&B de los años noventa, conocido por la canción I Believe I Can Fly. Pero a pesar de su fama, en aquella época era habitual verle en un McDonald’s de Chicago, donde atraía a las alumnas de un instituto cercano. Jane era una de esas chicas. Jane formaba parte de un equipo musical y conoció a Kelly cuando estaba en el instituto. Visitó su estudio de grabación con una tía, que era cantante profesional. Poco después de ese encuentro, Jane dijo a sus padres que Kelly iba a ser su padrino. Cuando sus padres se enteraron de la grabación sexual, Kelly se arrodilló ante ellos y les pidió perdón, según el testimonio de Jane. Pero en aquel entonces Jane imploró a sus padres que no tomaran medidas contra el músico porque ella lo “amaba”.

R. Kelly: Στη φυλακή για ακόμη ένα χρόνο μετά την τελευταία καταδίκη για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση,"Πέραν της ποινής των 30 ετών που ήδη εκτίει, ο R. Kelly θα περάσει έναν επιπλέον χρόνο στη φυλακή, μετά την τελευταία καταδίκη για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση.
Ο Kelly καταδικάστηκε σε 30 χρόνια φυλάκισης τον Ιούνιο του 2022, μετά από δίκη στη Νέα Υόρκη, με τις κατηγορίες της σεξουαλικής διακίνησης (trafficking) και του εκβιασμού.

Αρκετούς μήνες αργότερα, καταδικάστηκε σε μια δεύτερη ομοσπονδιακή δίκη στο Σικάγο για δελεασμό ανηλίκων για σεξ και παραγωγή παιδικών σεξουαλικών εικόνων.
Τώρα έχει λάβει 20ετή φυλάκιση για αυτά τα εγκλήματα, αλλά τα 19 εξ αυτών, θα τα εκτίει ταυτόχρονα με την προηγούμενη ποινή.
Εάν εκδοθεί πλήρως, θα μείνει στη φυλακή μέχρι να κλείσει τα 80 του χρόνια.
Οι ομοσπονδιακοί εισαγγελείς, όπως μεταδίδει το BBC, ζητούσαν ποινή κάθειρξης 25 ετών στη δεύτερη υπόθεση, υψηλότερη από αυτή που απαιτείται σύμφωνα με τις ομοσπονδιακές κατευθυντήριες γραμμές για την καταδίκη. Είπαν ότι η θέση του R. Kelly έγινε ακόμη πιο δυσμενής, καθώς κινηματογραφούσε τις πράξεις, με μερικά από τα πλάνα αργότερα να είναι διαθέσιμα στο διαδίκτυο.
«Επειδή ο Kelly είναι ο Kelly, περισσότεροι άνθρωποι έχουν παρακολουθήσει παιδική πορνογραφία», ανέφεραν σε ένα σημείωμα. «Τα αποτελέσματα της συμπεριφοράς του είναι εκτεταμένα, ανυπολόγιστα και μη αναστρέψιμα».
Το σημείωμα υποστήριξε ότι ο Kelly έχει μια «ακόρεστη» επιθυμία να κακοποιήσει τα παιδιά και ότι απαιτούνταν μια μακρά ποινή για να «προστατεύσει την κοινότητα» από περαιτέρω βλάβη.

R Kelly receives 20 years for child sexual abuse to be served concurrently with prior terms,"A federal judge on Thursday handed the singer R Kelly a 20-year prison sentence for his convictions on child sexual abuse images and enticement of minors for sex charges, but said he would serve nearly all of the sentence simultaneously with a 30-year sentence imposed last year on racketeering charges.
Harry Leinenweber also ordered that Kelly serve one year in prison following his New York sentence.
The central question going into the sentencing in Kelly’s home town, Chicago, was whether Leinenweber would order that the 56-year-old serve the sentence simultaneously with or only after he completes the New York term for 2021 racketeering and sex trafficking convictions. That would have been tantamount to a life sentence.
Prosecutors acknowledged that a lengthy term served only after the New York sentence could have erased any chance of Kelly getting out of prison alive. That was what they asked for, arguing that his crimes against children and lack of remorse justified it.
With Thursday’s sentence, Kelly will serve no more than 31 years and will be eligible for release at around age 80.
Leinenweber said at the outset of the hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to coerce underage girls for sex.
“The whole theory of grooming was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court. “It was the fear of lost love, lost affections [from Kelly] … It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”
A calm Kelly spoke briefly at the start of the hearing, when the judge asked if he had reviewed key presentencing documents for any inaccuracies.
“Your honor, I have gone over it with my attorney,” Kelly said. “I’m just relying on my attorney for that.”
Two of Kelly’s accusers asked the judge to punish him harshly.
In a statement read in court, a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane” said she lost her early aspirations to become a singer and her hopes for fulfilling relationships.
“I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly,” the statement said. “I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly … I have been permanently scarred by Robert.”
The woman was a key witness for prosecutors during Kelly’s trial. Four of his convictions are tied to her.
“When your virginity is taken by a pedophile at 14 … your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia”, attended the hearing and addressed Kelly directly. As her voice quivered, she said Kelly would repeatedly pick at her supposed faults while he abused her.
Now you are here … because there is something wrong with you. No longer will you be able to harm children. ‘Nia’, in a victim’s impact statement at R Kelly’s sentencing

The central question going into the sentencing in Kelly's hometown of Chicago, US, was whether District Judge Harry Leinenweber would order the 56-year-old to serve the additional sentence simultaneously with or only after he completes 30 years.
The latter would have been equal to a life sentence.
Prosecutors had acknowledged that lengthening his sentence would have erased any chance of Kelly getting out of prison alive, but argued that his crimes against children and lack of remorse justified it.
Two of Kelly's accusers also asked the judge to punish him harshly.

R Kelly to serve just one additional year in prison for convictions of child pornography and enticing minors for sex,"R Kelly is to serve just one additional year in prison for child pornography and enticement of minors for sex after completing his 30-year racketeering sentence.
A federal judge in Chicago on Thursday handed the singer a 20-year prison sentence for the convictions but said he will serve nearly all of the sentence simultaneously with the 30-year jail term imposed last year in New York on racketeering charges.
US District Judge Harry Leinenweber ordered that Kelly serve just one extra year in prison following the completion of his New York sentence.
The central question going into the sentencing in Kelly's hometown of Chicago was whether Leinenweber would order the 56-year-old Grammy Award winner to serve the sentence simultaneously with or only after he completes the New York term. The latter would have been tantamount to a life sentence.
With Thursday's sentence, though, Kelly will serve no more than 31 years. That means he will be eligible for release at around age 80, providing him some hope of one day leaving prison alive.
Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly last year on six of 13 counts: three counts of producing child porn and three of enticement of minors for sex.
In a statement read aloud in court at the sentencing, a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane” said she had lost her early aspirations to become a singer herself and her hopes for fulfilling relationships.
“I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly,” the statement said. “I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly. I have been permanently scarred by Robert.”
The woman was a key witness for prosecutors during Kelly’s trial; four of his convictions are tied to her.
“When your virginity is taken by a paedophile at 14 - your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia”, attended the hearing and addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly pick at her supposed faults while he abused her.
“Now you are here - because there is something wrong with you,” she said. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”
Kelly rose from poverty in Chicago to become one of the world's biggest R&B stars. Known for his smash hit I Believe I Can Fly and for songs such as Bump n' Grind, he sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.
In pre-sentencing filings, prosecutors described Kelly as ""a serial sexual predator"" who used his fame and wealth to reel in, sexually abuse and then discard star-struck fans.
US Assistant Attorney Jeannice Appenteng on Thursday urged the judge to set a longer sentence and keep Kelly in prison ""for the rest of his life"".
Kelly's abuse of children was all the worse, she said, because he ""memorialised"" his abuse by filming victims, including Jane. She told the court Kelly ""used Jane as a sex prop, a thing"" for producing pornographic videos.
In pre-hearing filings, Kelly's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, accused prosecutors of offering an ""embellished narrative"" in an attempt to get the judge to join what she called the government's ""bloodthirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the £MeToo movement"".
Ms Bonjean said Kelly has suffered enough, including financially. She said his worth once approached one billion US dollars (£830 million), but that he ""is now destitute"".
In court on Thursday, Ms Bonjean said Kelly will be lucky to survive his 30-year New York sentence alone. To give him a consecutive 25-year sentence on top of that ""is overkill, it is symbolic,"" she said. ""Why? Because it is R Kelly.""
She also argued that Kelly's silence should not be viewed as a lack of remorse.
She said that while she advised Kelly not to speak because he continues to appeal his convictions and could face other legal action, ""He would like to, he would like to very much.""",2023-02-23T18:38:31Z,https://www.standard.co.uk,Evening Standard

Singer R. Kelly sentenced to one year on federal child pornography conviction,"Grammy-winning R&B artist R. Kelly was sentenced on Thursday to one year in prison after his conviction in Chicago on federal child pornography and enticement charges, local media reported.
Kelly was convicted in September of felony sexual exploitation of a child, enticement of a female and possession of material containing child pornography.
Judge Harry Leinenweber of the U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois ordered the sentence to run consecutively with the 30-year sentence Kelly received last year on a previous federal conviction in New York, the Chicago Sun Times reported in a tweet.
In that case, Kelly was convicted of multiple felonies including illegal sex with minors and sexual exploitation of minors.
In the federal case in Illinois, prosecutors argued that the singer was so incorrigible that ""the only way to ensure Kelly does not re-offend is to impose a sentence that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life."" They want to add another 25 years to his existing 30-year sentence.
Defense attorneys said Kelly, a 56-year-old African American man who suffers from diabetes, was already facing an effective life sentence with the 30-year term. They acknowledged that the judge must impose a sentence of 10 years, but contended that it should run concurrently.
They also questioned why federal prosecutors have dedicated so many resources to prosecuting a Black artist when many of the biggest white stars in rock 'n' roll history have been accused of abusing underage girls and ""none have been prosecuted and none will die in prison.""
Defense lawyer Jennifer Bonjean alleged a double standard for a Black artist, naming 11 white rock stars in her sentencing memo who have been accused of abusing underage girls and gone unpunished.
Kelly did not address the judge because he still faced prosecution in other jurisdictions and any statement could be used against him, Bonjean said.",2023-02-23T18:20:41Z,https://www.cnbc.com,CNBC
R. Kelly Sentenced to 20 Years for Child Sex Crimes,"CHICAGO — A federal judge on Thursday sentenced R. Kelly to 20 years in prison for child sex crimes, after a jury found that he had produced three videos of himself sexually abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter.
In a victory for the defense, the judge ruled that all but one year of the prison sentence would be served at the same time as a previous 30-year sentence that Mr. Kelly received after a jury in Brooklyn convicted him of racketeering and sex trafficking charges.
The jury in Chicago convicted Mr. Kelly of six of the 13 charges brought against him in connection with sexual abuse during the 1990s, including three counts of coercing minors into sexual activity and three of producing sex tapes involving a minor. He was acquitted of a charge that he had attempted to obstruct an earlier investigation into his abuse of the goddaughter, and two other counts of enticing minors to have sex.
Federal prosecutors had argued that Mr. Kelly, 56, deserved 25 years in prison on top of his earlier sentence, citing the singer’s “lack of remorse” as a reason he would pose a danger to society if released.",2023-02-23T18:17:34Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times

R. Kelly sentenced in Chicago child pornography case,"A federal judge in Chicago sentenced R. Kelly to 20 years for his federal convictions of child pornography and enticement of minors for sex on Thursday morning.
Of the 240-month sentence, 12 months will be served consecutively while the remaining 19 years will be served concurrent with his existing sentence.
Kelly will serve a total of 31 years – which includes the 30-year term imposed last year in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking.
He is now 56 and could be locked up until he’s in his late 70s.
U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber ordered Kelly to pay $42,000 in restitution to one of the victims in the case, known as Pauline during the trial. But he denied claims from two other women in the case, known as Jane and Nia, saying they already reached a settlement with Kelly in a civil case.
""Obviously these three ladies are seriously injured,"" Leinenweber said, ""but it doesn’t seem restitution is the proper vehicle to do that.""
The sentencing hearing began with all three women telling the judge why they thought Kelly should spend the rest of his life in prison for sexually abusing them when they were minors.
""I have lost so much due to this,"" said one woman, identified in court as Pauline.
She accused Kelly of pitting her against her friend Jane, another victim who testified at Kelly’s trial, and they no longer talk.
An attorney for Jane read a statement from her: ""Robert shattered me. I need closure. And I need Robert in jail for as long as the law will allow.""
A third woman, identified in court as Nia, said she is not a ""revengeful person"" but that the judge should sentence Kelly to stay behind bars for the rest of his life. ""You came before this judge because something is wrong with you,"" Nia said, addressing Kelly as he sat with his attorney Jennifer Bonjean at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse.

"R. Kelly sentenced to 20 years in child porn case, mostly to be served concurrently with current term","R. Kelly was sentenced Thursday in Chicago to 20 years in prison after being convicted of child pornography and enticement of minors for sex, but the R&B singer dodged much more actual time behind bars.
He’ll serve 19 of those years at the same time as the 30-year sentence he received last year after a trial in New York, U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber said.

Prosecutors had called for the federal judge to give Kelly a 25-year penalty that wouldn’t begin until his first sentence ended. Kelly’s defense team pushed for the singer to receive a 10-year penalty to be served completely concurrently.
Thursday’s sentencing relates to the 56-year-old Kelly’s conviction last September on three counts of child pornography and three counts of enticement of minors for sex. He was found guilty on those counts after a month-long trial in Chicago, during which four accusers testified.

The Chicago-born Kelly, whose full name is Robert Kelly, wasn’t convicted last year of an obstruction of justice charge that accused him of rigging his 2008 child pornography trial, which ended in his acquittal.
The 2008 trial largely centered on a video that prosecutors claimed shows Kelly, then around 30, abusing a 14-year-old girl, who didn’t testify at the time.
The accuser, now in her 30s, testified last year under the pseudonym Jane and claimed to be the girl in the video. Four of the charges that Kelly was convicted of related to Jane.
“I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly. I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly. … I have been permanently scarred by Robert,” Jane said in a statement read during Thursday’s sentencing hearing.
“When your virginity is taken by a pedophile at 14 … your life is never your own.”
Prosecutors hoped a new sentence tacked onto Kelly’s first would function as a life penalty for the Grammy winner.

Before announcing the sentence, Leinenweber disagreed with the prosecutors’ claim Kelly used fear to prey on underage girls.

“The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” Leinenweber said toward the beginning of the sentencing hearing. “It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly)’. … It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”
Kelly confirmed at the beginning of Thursday’s proceedings that he’d looked over documents in the case.
“Your honor, I have gone over it with my attorney,” Kelly said. “I’m just relying on my attorney for that.”
Last year’s Chicago trial ended less than three months after Kelly was sentenced to 30 years after being found guilty in New York of racketeering and sex trafficking.
Kelly, whose hits include “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Ignition,” has long denied accusations of sexual misconduct involving minors. The allegations received renewed attention with the release of the 2019 documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which featured accusers sharing their accounts.

R. Kelly sentenced to one additional year in prison in Illinois sex abuse case,"CHICAGO — Disgraced musician R. Kelly was sentenced to one additional year in prison by an Illinois federal judge Thursday, nearly five months after he was convicted of sexual exploitation and enticement of a minor.
The sentence is to be served after the 30 years Kelly, 56, is serving after being found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking by a New York jury in 2021.
Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was convicted last year on six counts of sexual exploitation and enticement of a minor in a case stemming from the complaints of women who said he lured them into sex acts while they were underage.
Federal prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber for the Northern District of Illinois to sentence Kelly to 25 years in prison, saying last week that the musician was “sadistic” and “a serial sexual predator” who “poses a serious danger to society.” Kelly's attorney Jennifer Bonjean requested a sentence of around 10 years to be served alongside the New York sentence.
Leinenweber's full sentence also includes 19 years to be served concurrent with the New York sentence.
The judge said he believed ""sentencing should be sufficient but not greater than necessary,"" adding that ""everybody agrees that the nature of this offense is horrible, horrific.”
“No matter what I do Mr. Kelly is not going out the door in the next 10 years, in the next 20 years,” Leinenweber said. ""One of the things we should bear in mind, he is 56 years old and as Ms. Bonjean points out, he has a life expectancy of not a helluva lot more.”
In court filings before Thursday's hearing, prosecutors argued that a sentence that kept the musician imprisoned for life was ""the only way to ensure Kelly does not reoffend.""
But Bonjean said he was already serving what was effectively a life sentence.
“Kelly would have to defy all statistical odds to make it out of prison alive,” she said in a court filing last week.
Kelly appeared in court Thursday wearing an orange jumpsuit, black glasses and a brace on his left leg.
He nodded several times to his family and supporters who filled the courtroom. At the end of the hearing, one supporter stood up and yelled “I’m here for you” to Kelly, which prompted more people to yell ""We love you"" and ""We've got you.""
He waved and nodded at them before he was taken away.
Kelly had faced 13 counts, including charges of sexual exploitation of a minor, receipt of child pornography, enticement of a minor to engage in unlawful sexual conduct, conspiring to obstruct justice and conspiring to receive child pornography in the Illinois trial. He was acquitted on seven counts, including all of the charges related to conspiracy.
The singer was tried alongside two co-defendants, his former business manager Derrel McDavid and his associate Milton “June” Brown, who were both found not guilty on all charges.
Prosecutors centered their case around a star witness, identified by the pseudonym Jane in court, who identified herself as the person in a 26-minute videotape sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times in 2002 that allegedly showed Kelly performing sex acts with an underage girl.
In emotional testimony, Jane, now 38, said the singer began having sex with her when she was 15 and he was in his 30s and continued to do so “hundreds” of times before she turned 18.
Several other alleged victims also testified that the singer groomed and manipulated them into sexual relationships, some which were recorded, while they were underage.
Before the sentence was handed down, Christopher Brown, an attorney for Jane, read her victim impact statement aloud in court.
“I have lost my dignity due to Robert Kelly,"" the statement said. ""I have lost my dreams due to R. Kelly, I have lost my teenage years due to Robert Kelly.""
She asked that Kelly be ""put in jail for the rest of his natural born life.”
Last month, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx dropped 10 state charges of sex abuse against the singer saying that “justice has been served” with the two federal convictions. She added that her office’s “limited resources and court time” were the ultimate factors, noting that it found the accusations to be credible.",2023-02-23T17:42:00Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
R. Kelly dodges 'life sentence' in child porn case,"R. Kelly dodged an effective life sentence Thursday when a Chicago judge tacked on just one extra year to his 30-year punishment behind bars.
The 56-year-old disgraced R&B singer was sentenced in his Illinois case to 20 years in prison — with 19 to run concurrently with his existing, 30-year sentence out of Brooklyn.
That means he’ll only serve one extra year behind bars, and would be eligible for release when he is 80 years old.
Chicago prosecutors had asked that Kelly be slapped with 25 years, to be served consecutively with the Brooklyn case — which would’ve meant the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer would be eligible for release in 2066 at age 99, effectively amounting to a life sentence.
Chicago federal court Judge HarryLeinenweber had said at the start of the hearing that he disagreed with prosecutors that Kelly had used fear as a tactic for ensnaring minor sex abuse victims.
“The [government’s[ whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court. “It was the fear of lost love, lost affections [from Kelly]. … It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”

The sentence came after a Chicago jury last year convicted the perv, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, on six of 13 counts — three of them for producing child porn in connection with videos of himself abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter, and three of enticement of minors for sex.
Kelly spoke at the start of Thursday’s hearing, answering US District Judge Harry Leinenweber when he asked if he had reviewed evidence for any inaccuracies.
“Your honor, I have gone over it with my attorney,” Kelly said. “I’m just relying on my attorney for that.”
Defense lawyer Jennifer Bonjean told the court that she had advised her client not to address his victims, and asked the judge not to view his silence as a lack of remorse.
“He would like to [speak], he would like to very much,” she said, but noted he was undergoing appeals processes and could still face additional legal action.
Two accusers read statements aloud in court, asking the judge to harshly punish the convicted sexual predator.
“I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly,” a woman who addressed the court under the pseudonym “Jane” said. “I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly. … I have been permanently scarred by Robert.”
“When your virginity is taken by a pedophile at 14 … your life is never your own,” she continued.
Another accuser had addressed Kelly directly, speaking under the pseudonym “Nina.”
“Now you are here … because there is something wrong with you,” she said, as her voice quivered. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”
Kelly was acquitted of charges that he had rigged the not-guilty results of a 2008 child porn trial, in addition to being cleared of three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and two enticement charges.

Defense attorneys argued that Kelly should be slapped with a 10-year sentence, served concurrently with his current prison term.
Last month, Cook County, Illinois, Judge Lawrence Flood dropped additional sex abuse charges in connection with alleged abuse of three minors and one woman by Kelly at the advice of a prosecutor.
State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said she was comfortable with the dismissal of the state charges because the three-time Grammy winner was set to spend decades behind bars.
The move prompted accuser Lanita Carter to rail that “justice was denied” for her.
“I have spent nearly 20 years hoping that my abuser would be brought to justice for what he did to me,” Carter said.
Another sexual misconduct case against Kelly is pending in Minnesota.
Kelly, who illegally married the late singer Aaliyah when she was just 15 after falsifying documents, was the target of widespread outrage and criminal charges after the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” detailed his penchant for abusing minors.

R. Kelly to learn if he must serve 25 years after his 30-year prison term,"R. Kelly leaves the Daley Center after a hearing in his child support case in Chicago in 2019.Matt Marton
R. Kelly is set to learn whether he will spend the rest of his life in prison when a federal judge sentences him Thursday on convictions of child pornography and enticement of minors for sex.
Prosecutors have asked the judge overseeing the sentencing hearing in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago to order him to serve a 25-year sentence only after he completes a 30-year term imposed last year in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking.
That would make the 56-year-old Grammy Award winner eligible for release in 2066, a year shy of his 100th birthday. The defence wants a sentence of around 10 years, served concurrently.
If Judge Harry Leinenweber does let Kelly serve his new sentence simultaneously with the New York sentence, he should be eligible for release when he is about 80 – providing him some hope of one day resuming life outside prison.
Leinenweber said at the outset of the hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to woo underage girls for sex.
“The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court. “It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly)’. It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”
Prosecutors say Kelly’s crimes against children and his lack of remorse justify the stiffer sentence.
A calm Kelly spoke briefly at the start of the hearing, when the judge asked him if he had reviewed key presentencing documents for any inaccuracies.
“Your honour, I have gone over it with my attorney,” Kelly said. “I’m just relying on my attorney for that.”
Two of Kelly’s accusers asked the judge to punish him harshly.
In a statement read aloud in court, a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane” said she had lost her early aspirations to become a singer herself and her hopes for fulfilling relationships.
“I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly,” the statement said. “I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly. “I have been permanently scarred by Robert.”
The woman was a key witness for prosecutors during Kelly’s trial; four of his convictions are tied to her.
“When your virginity is taken by a pedophile at 14 your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia,” attended the hearing and addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly pick at her supposed faults while he abused her.
“Now you are here because there is something wrong with you,” she said. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”
Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly last year on six of 13 counts: three counts of producing child porn and three of enticement of minors for sex.
Kelly rose from poverty in Chicago to become one of the world’s biggest R&B stars. Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” he sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.
In presentencing filings, prosecutors described Kelly as “a serial sexual predator” who used his fame and wealth to reel in, sexually abuse and then discard star-struck fans.
U.S. Assistant Attorney Jeannice Appenteng on Thursday urged the judge to set a longer sentence and keep Kelly in prison “for the rest of his life.”
Kelly’s abuse of children was all the worse, she said, because he “memorialized” his abuse by filming victims, including Jane. She told the court Kelly “used Jane as a sex prop, a thing” for producing pornographic videos.
In prehearing filings, Kelly’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, accused prosecutors of offering an “embellished narrative” in an attempt to get the judge to join what she called the government’s “bloodthirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement.”
Bonjean said Kelly has suffered enough, including financially. She said his worth once approached $1 billion, but that he “is now destitute.”
In court Thursday, Bonjean said Kelly will be lucky to survive his 30-year New York sentence alone. To give him a consecutive 25-year sentence on top of that “is overkill, it is symbolic,” she said. “Why? Because it is R. Kelly.”
She also argued that Kelly’s silence should not be viewed as a lack of remorse.
She said that while she advised Kelly not to speak because he continues to appeal his convictions and could face other legal action, “He would like to, he would like to very much.”",2023-02-23T17:12:07Z,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,The Globe and Mail

A federal judge in Chicago sentenced singer R. Kelly to 20 years in prison for his child pornography and enticement of minors for sex convictions Thursday.
However, the sentencing only adds one more year to his prison time as Kelly will serve 19 years concurrently with his New York prison sentence, according to Chicago ABC station WLS. He would then be required to serve one year in the Chicago case.
Kelly is already serving a30-year prison sentenceafter he wasconvictedin a New York federal court last year of racketeering and violating the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law, including having sex with underage girls.
Kelly could have could faced between 10 to 90 years in prison for the crimes he was charged with in Chicago.
Prosecutors had recommended Kelly serve 25 years in prison, consecutively to his New York sentence, calling him a sexual predator who used his fame and wealth to abuse his victims, and has shown no remorse, according to WLS.
Kelly's lawyer asked for a sentence of 10 years to be served concurrently with his New York sentence, saying Kelly being abused as a child justified leniency, according to WLS.
The disgraced 55-year-old singer was found guilty in September in what was his second federal trial.
Kelly faced multiple child pornography, sex abuse and obstruction charges involving an earlier investigation that ended with his acquittal in a 2008 state child pornography trial in his hometown of Chicago.
Prosecutors alleged that in the late 1990s, Kelly engaged in sex acts with five victims while they were all under the age of 18 and created explicit videos with four of them.
A jury found Kelly guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of enticing a minor. He was acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him of fixing the 2008 trial.

R. Kelly Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison For Child Pornography Case,"R. Kelly was sentenced to 20 years in prison for child sex crimes in a Chicago federal courtroom on Thursday.
The 56-year-old singer, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was found guilty of six of the 13 charges brought against him, including three counts of coercing minors into sexual activity and three of producing sex tapes involving a minor.
The jury found that Kelly had produced three videos of himself sexually abusing his then 14-year-old goddaughter. He was acquitted of a charge that he had attempted to block an earlier investigation into his abuse of the goddaughter, and two other counts of enticing minors to have sex.
Kelly is already serving a 30-year prison term for his 2021 conviction on racketeering and sex trafficking charges in a New York federal court. Though prosecutors asked for a 25-year sentence to be served once his other 30-year prison sentence is complete, the judge ruled that all but one year of the prison sentence would be served at the same time as the previous sentence.
“The only way to ensure he will not re-offend is to impose a sentence that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life,” said prosecutor Jeannice Williams Appenteng, according to a report by the New York Times.
The sentencing hearing is the culmination of nearly three decades of allegations against Kelly. In 2002, Kelly was indicted on several child pornography charges for allegedly videotaping himself having sex with an unidentified underage girl, but he was acquitted in 2008 on all counts after the jury deliberated for a day.

R. Kelly avoids lengthy add-on to 30-year prison sentence,"Michael Tarm And Claire Savage, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly was sentenced on Thursday to 20 years in prison for child pornography and enticement of minors for sex but will serve all but one of those simultaneously with a 30-year sentence on racketeering and sex trafficking convictions.
U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber ordered that Kelly serve one year in prison following the racketeering sentence, imposed last year in New York.
The central question going into the sentencing in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago was whether Leinenweber would order the 56-year-old Grammy Award winner to serve the sentence simultaneously with or only after he completes the New York term. The latter would have been tantamount to a life sentence.
Prosecutors had acknowledged that a lengthy term served only after the New York sentence could have erased any chance of Kelly ever getting out of prison alive. It’s what they asked for, arguing his crimes against children and lack of remorse justified it.
With Thursday's sentence, though, Kelly will serve no more than 31 years. That means he will be eligible for release at around age 80, providing him some hope of one day leaving prison alive.
Leinenweber said at the outset of the hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to woo underage girls for sex.
“The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court. “It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly)'. … It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”

R. Kelly Sentencing in Child Porn Case Could Mean Life Behind Bars,"A federal judge will sentence R. Kelly for his Chicago convictions of child pornography and enticement of minors for sex on Thursday (Feb. 23), when the 56-year-old singer will learn if he must spend the rest of his life behind bars or if he will have some hope of getting out.
The central question for the judge at the hearing in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago is whether to heed prosecutors’ request to order that Kelly serve a new sentence only after he completes his 30-year term imposed last year in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking.
A sentence that Kelly must serve consecutively would be tantamount to a life sentence.
Prosecutors acknowledge that a lengthy term served after the New York sentence would practically erase any chance of Kelly ever leaving prison alive. They say the Grammy Award-winner’s crimes against children and his lack of remorse justified that.
They recommend a 25-year sentence served consecutively. That would make him eligible for release in 2066, a year shy of his 100th birthday. The defense wants a sentence of around 10 years, served simultaneously.
If the judge does let Kelly serve his new sentence simultaneously with the New York sentence, he will serve no more than the 30 years and should be eligible for release at around age 80 — providing him some hope of one day resuming life outside prison.

R. Kelly Learns His Fate After Prosecutors Sought What Could Have Been a ‘Life' Sentence,"R.

"R. Kelly sentenced to 20 years in Chicago sex crimes, 19 years served along with previous sentence","Singer R. Kelly received a 20 year prison sentence in his federal Chicago sex crimes case, with nineteen years of the sentence being served along with his New York sentence.
CHICAGO -- R. Kelly was sentenced to 20 years in prison in Chicago.
Nineteen of the years from this sentence will be served along with his New York sentence, which means he will spend an additional year in prison.
Kelly is being sentenced on his convictions of child pornography and enticement in Chicago.
He was convicted in September on three counts of producing child pornography and three counts of enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity.
Prosecutors were recommending Kelly serve 25 more years, consecutively to his New York sentence. They said he is a sexual predator who used his fame and wealth to abuse his victims and has shown no remorse.
Kelly's lawyer has asked for a sentence of 10 years, serving it at the same time as his New York sentence. The lawyer added Kelly's own abuse as a child justifies leniency.
What happened at the trials
The federal trial in Chicago last September was based on allegations from five minors who prosecutors allege were abused by Kelly in the late 1990s by making explicit videos with four of them.
One of the witnesses in the trial, a 37-year-old woman, spoke in federal court under the pseudonym Jane and testified Kelly began engaging in sex acts with her when she was 14 and had sex with her starting when she was 15. They had sex ""hundreds"" of times before she turned 18, she said.
She testified that she falsely denied they had a sexual relationship in interviews with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, Chicago police investigators and to a grand jury in 2002.
""Why were you untruthful?"" a prosecutor asked Jane in court.
""Because I was afraid to expose Robert. Because I was afraid of what might happen to my parents,"" she said. ""I also did not want that person to be me.""
The jury convicted Kelly of six charges, including three counts of producing videos depicting sexual conduct with Jane and three counts of enticing Jane and two other minors to engage in sexual activity. He was acquitted on seven other counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice. Two associates were acquitted of all charges.
At the time of the Chicago federal trial, Kelly had already been convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in a New York federal trial.
In that case, prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York accused Kelly of using his status as a celebrity and a ""network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.""
The New York trial included testimony from witnesses who said they were sexually and physically abused by Kelly. The court also heard from people involved with orchestrating Kelly's 1994 marriage to the late singer Aaliyah when she was just 15 years old and he was an adult after she believed she'd gotten pregnant.
Last month, prosecutors in Cook County, Illinois, dropped state sex-crime charges against Kelly, citing in part his lengthy federal sentence.
""I understand how hard it was for these victims to come forward and tell their stories. I applaud their courage and have the utmost respect for everyone who came forward,"" Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said in a news release. ""While this may not be the result they were expecting, due to the sentences that Mr. Kelly is facing, we do feel that justice has been served.""
Through the allegations, Kelly was one of the most successful R &B artists of the 1990s and 2000s, known for hit songs ""Bump N' Grind,"" ""Ignition (Remix)"" and ""I Believe I Can Fly,"" which won him three Grammy Awards. He has been nominated for 26 Grammy Awards in all, including as recently as 2015.

R. Kelly sentencing to determine if he spends rest of life in prison,"Feb 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge in Illinois on Thursday is due to sentence musician R. Kelly for child pornography and coercion, deciding whether to tack more time onto a 30-year sentence from a previous case that alone would keep Kelly in prison well into his 80s.
Kelly, 56, the Grammy-winning R&B artist, has been convicted in two separate trials of luring multiple underage girls into sex by leveraging his wealth and fame, in some case recording the abuse on video.
Prosecutors have argued in a sentencing memo that Kelly is so incorrigible that ""the only way to ensure Kelly does not reoffend is to impose a sentence that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life."" They want to add another 25 years to his existing 30-year sentence.
Defense attorneys say a 56-year-old African American man with diabetes is already facing an effective life sentence with the existing 30-year term. They acknowledge the judge must impose a minimum sentence of 10 years, but contend it should run concurrently.
They also question why federal prosecutors have dedicated so many resources to prosecuting a Black artist when many of the biggest white stars in rock 'n' roll history have been accused of abusing underage girls and ""none have been prosecuted and none will die in prison.""
Last year a federal judge in the Eastern District of New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison based on his 2021 conviction for multiple felonies including illegal sex with minors and sexual exploitation of minors.
In a separate trial last year, he was also convicted of multiple felonies in the Northern District of Illinois, where Judge Harry Leinenweber will preside over the sentencing hearing on Thursday.
Federal prosecutors label Kelly a serial sexual predator whose ""desire to sexually abuse children is insatiable. ... He cannot be deterred.""
Defense lawyer Jennifer Bonjean alleges a double standard for a Black artist, naming 11 white rock stars in her sentencing memo who have been accused of abusing underage girls and gone unpunished.
""There was a whole culture around it and so yes I do think there's a disproportionate attention on Mr. Kelly,"" Bonjean said in a telephone interview. ""The '90s R&B star looks a lot different than these old rock 'n' roll artists.""
Kelly will not address the judge, Bonjean said, because he still faces prosecution in other jurisdictions and any statement could be used against him.

R. Kelly é condenado a 20 anos de prisão por abuso sexual de crianças,"A sentença vem cinco meses após o artista ser condenado, por um júri de Nova York
O cantor e compositor R. Kelly foi sentenciado a 20 anos de prisão, nesta quinta-feira (23), por abuso sexual infantil. O júri do tribunal federal de Chicago, nos Estados Unidos, o considerou culpado por ter feito três vídeos nos quais ele abusa sexualmente da afilhada de 14 anos.
A sentença vem cinco meses após o artista ser condenado, por um júri de Nova York, a 30 anos de prisão por tráfico sexual e extorsão de menores.
O juiz Harry Leinenweber, de Chicago, determinou que R. Kelly vai cumprir, em prisão federal, 19 dos 20 anos do cárcere hoje definido simultaneamente à condenação anterior. Na prática, o parecer desta quinta acrescenta um ano a mais de prisão para o artista.
Em Chicago, o cantor e compositor de 56 anos foi considerado culpado em seis das 13 acusações feitas contra ele, todas ocorridas na década de 1990.
Os procuradores haviam pedido 25 anos de prisão para o cantor e compositor alegando que ele representa um “perigo para a sociedade” e que o abuso sexual de menores praticado por R. Kelly foi “intencional e prolífico”.
A advogada do artista, Jennifer Bonjean, pediu que a sentença fosse de aproximadamente uma década e que fosse cumprida com a de Nova York.
“Não importa o que eu faça, o sr. Kelly não vai sair [da cadeia] pelos próximos dez ou 20 anos”, afirmou Leinenweber. “Uma das coisas que nós deveríamos ter em mente é que ele tem 56 anos e, como Bonjean apontou, a expectativa de vida dele não é grande coisa.”

No processo judicial, a advogada de R. Kelly argumentou que a sentença de Nova York já era equivalente a uma prisão perpétua. “Ele teria que desafiar todas as probabilidades estatísticas para sair vivo da prisão”, ela argumentou.

R. Kelly’s two-decade legal saga over sex abuse of teen girls set to end in a Chicago federal courtroom Thursday,"A dramatic legal saga that began in a Cook County courtroom 20 years ago will draw to a close Thursday when disgraced R&B star R. Kelly is slated for sentencing in Chicago’s federal courthouse on convictions related to child pornography and sexual conduct with minors.
While Kelly faces anywhere from 10 to 90 years, the sentence itself might seem superfluous since he’s already serving three decades in prison on a federal racketeering case in New York. Just about the only question left is whether he gets more time tacked on in a consecutive sentence that would make it a virtual certainty he’ll never be released.

But just like every aspect of the criminal cases against the Chicago-born singer, Thursday’s hearing at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse promises to be contentious.
Prosecutors allege Kelly is a serial child sex abuser who has engaged in remorseless victim-blaming, while his attorneys have accused prosecutors of conducting a “blood-thirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement rather than treat him as a human being.”

Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, has asked U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber for a concurrent sentence close to the minimum, while prosecutors want Kelly to serve an additional 25 years behind bars, in addition to the other prison term handed down in Brooklyn last year.
A longer sentence in Chicago would also ensure Kelly stays behind bars if his New York conviction is overturned on appeal. While such requests are rarely granted, Bonjean has promised a vigorous fight to throw out the case at a higher court.
Thursday’s hearing will also offer Kelly one last chance to address the court on his own behalf. Defendants appealing their convictions sometimes choose not to, though the law does not allow Leinenweber to hold it against Kelly either way.
Kelly opted not to address the judge at his sentencing in New York, and he did not testify in either trial.
Kelly, 56, was convicted by a jury in September on charges including child pornography related to his years of sexual abuse of his goddaughter, “Jane,” as well as sexual misconduct with two other girls. He was acquitted, however, of the explosive allegations that he and others conspired to rig his initial Cook County trial in 2008.
“Plain and simple, Kelly does not comprehend that what he did was wrong,” prosecutors wrote in a recent court filing, saying a consecutive sentence was necessary to “protect the community from Kelly, as he has shown no signs of rehabilitation.”
Bonjean wrote in response that Kelly was prepared to plead guilty to some of the charges on which he was eventually convicted. Prosecutors maintained that any deal had to involve the conspiracy charges too, and the dealing fell apart, Bonjean wrote.

“Kelly was willing to accept responsibility for certain conduct, but it was the government that pushed this case to a trial insisting on guilty pleas to offenses that resulted in acquittals anyway,” she wrote.
Leinenweber will also consider whether Kelly must pay as much as $13 million in restitution to the victims in the case, though he noted dryly in a recent order that given Kelly’s extensive financial obligations it’s unlikely the victims will see much money.
Kelly’s five-week federal trial in Chicago featured some 34 witnesses. The jury was shown clips from three separate videos made in the 1990s allegedly depicting Kelly abusing Jane, including the same tape from his Cook County trial as well as another where he instructed her to refer repeatedly to her “14-year-old” genitalia.

Jane, as she was known in the trial, testified for the first time that not only was it her on the videotapes, but that Kelly had sexually abused her “innumerable” times when she was a minor, at his recording studio, his home, on tour buses and in hotel rooms.
Asked on the witness stand why, after two decades of silence, she finally decided to come forward and speak out, Jane said: “I became exhausted with living with (Kelly’s) lies.”
The jury’s split verdict came 14 years after Kelly’s infamous acquittal on similar charges in Cook County, which were based on a single video of Kelly allegedly abusing Jane in the hot tub room of his former home on West George Street. Jane had refused to cooperate in that case.

Kelly was also found guilty on three out of five counts related to enticement of a minor involving Jane and two other victims who came forward to testify against him.
But in a rare loss for federal prosecutors, the jury acquitted Kelly and two co-defendants on charges they conspired to retrieve incriminating tapes and rig his 2008 trial by pressuring Jane to lie to investigators about their relationship and refuse to testify against him.
Kelly was also found not guilty of filming himself with Jane on a video that jurors never saw. Prosecutors said “Video 4″ was not played because Kelly’s team successfully buried it, but defense attorneys questioned whether it existed at all.
Bonjean is appealing Kelly’s conviction and sentence in Brooklyn’s federal court, where an appellate brief is due next month. She’s also planning to appeal his conviction in Chicago to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Other than those appeals, which could take years, Kelly’s long legal road appears to be coming to an end. Last month, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced she was dropping four separate Cook County indictments against Kelly, in part to conserve resources given his two federal convictions.

Kelly is also facing a charge of solicitation in Minnesota, though the case has been largely dormant while the federal cases have made their way through court.

Bonjean’s sentencing memo filed last week delved deeply into Kelly’s own traumatic childhood in Chicago, including being shot in the arm at age 14 while riding his bike, witnessing frequent domestic violence, and being repeatedly sexually abused by a sister and family friend.
“Kelly was a damaged man in his late 20s with an extraordinarily traumatic childhood that he failed to confront,” Bonjean wrote. “He lacked the insights or ability to appreciate the ways in which his traumatic childhood impacted his unhealthy sexual development and harmful choices.”
But prosecutors in their filing last week said Kelly “brazenly blames his victims” while refusing to accept responsibility for his crimes.
“At the age of 56 years old, Kelly’s lack of remorse and failure to grasp the gravity of his criminal conduct against children demonstrates that he poses a serious danger to society,” prosecutors said.

R. Kelly to learn if he effectively gets ‘life’ sentence,"CHICAGO—R. Kelly is set to learn whether he will spend the rest of his life in prison when a federal judge sentences him Thursday on convictions for child pornography and enticement of minors for sex.
Prosecutors have asked the judge overseeing the sentencing hearing in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago to order him to serve a 25-year sentence only after he completes a 30-year term imposed last year in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking.
That would make the 56-year-old Grammy Award winner eligible for release in 2066, a year shy of his 100th birthday. The defense wants a sentence of around 10 years, served concurrently.
If Judge Harry Leinenweber does let Kelly serve his new sentence simultaneously with the New York sentence, he will serve no more than the 30 years and should be eligible for release at around age 80 — providing him some hope of one day resuming life outside prison.
In a potentially key ruling early, Leinenweber said at the outset of the hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to woo underage girls for sex.
“The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court. “It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly)’. … It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”
Prosecutors say Kelly’s crimes against children and his lack of remorse justify the stiffer sentence.
A calm Kelly spoke briefly at the start of the hearing, when the judge asked him if he had reviewed key presentencing documents for any inaccuracies.
“Your honor, I have gone over it with my attorney,” Kelly said. “I’m just relying on my attorney for that.”
Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly last year on six of 13 counts: three counts of producing child porn and three of enticement of minors for sex. Kelly was acquitted of the marqueecount.

Sentença de R. Kelly pode mantê-lo preso pelo resto da vida,"Por Daniel Trotta
(Reuters) – Um juiz do Estado norte-americano de Illinois anunciará a sentença do cantor R. Kelly nesta quinta-feira por pornografia infantil e coerção, decidindo se acrescenta mais tempo a uma sentença de 30 anos de um caso anterior que por si só manteria o artista na prisão até seus 80 anos.
O vencedor do Grammy, de 56 anos, foi condenado em dois julgamentos separados por atrair várias meninas menores de idade para fazer sexo, aproveitando sua riqueza e fama, e em alguns casos gravando o abuso em vídeo.
Os promotores argumentaram em um memorando de sentença que o cantor é tão incorrigível que “a única maneira de garantir que Kelly não reincida é impor uma sentença que o manterá na prisão pelo resto de sua vida”. Eles querem adicionar mais 25 anos à sua sentença de 30 anos.
Os advogados de defesa dizem que um homem negro de 56 anos com diabetes já está enfrentando uma sentença de prisão perpétua com o prazo existente de 30 anos. Eles reconhecem que o juiz deve impor uma sentença mínima de 10 anos, mas afirmam que ela deve ser executada de forma concomitante.
Eles também questionam por que os promotores federais dedicaram tantos recursos para processar um artista negro quando muitas das maiores estrelas brancas da história do rock ‘n’ roll foram acusadas de abusar de meninas menores de idade e “nenhuma foi processada e nenhuma morrerá na prisão”.
No ano passado, um juiz federal do Distrito Leste de Nova York condenou Kelly a 30 anos de prisão com base em sua condenação em 2021 por vários crimes, incluindo sexo ilegal com menores e exploração sexual de menores.
Em um julgamento separado no ano passado, ele também foi condenado por vários crimes no Distrito Norte de Illinois, onde o juiz Harry Leinenweber presidirá a audiência de sentença nesta quinta-feira.",2023-02-23T03:00:00Z,https://www.mixvale.com.br,Portal Mix Vale

Kelly, estrela do R&B que havia sido condenado a 30 anos de prisão por crimes sexuais, foi sentenciado a 20 anos de prisão nesta quinta-feira (23) por pornografia infantil em um caso separado, em uma corte federal de Chicago.
O juiz Harry Leinenweber ordenou que a maior parte da nova sentença fosse executada concomitantemente, exceto por um ano, que ele expurgaria assim que a anterior, emitida em junho passado em Nova York, fosse cumprida.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 56, foi considerado culpado por um júri federal em Chicago pelo crime de produção de pornografia infantil e corrupção de menores.
Extratos de vídeos que mostram a violência sexual cometida por R. Kelly contra meninas, uma delas de 14 anos, foram divulgados durante o processo.
O cantor, acusado de ter obstruído o desenvolvimento de outro processo anterior por pornografia infantil em 2008, foi absolvido das acusações de obstrução da justiça.
Mundialmente famoso por seu hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"", R. Kelly teve uma carreira de sucesso no R&B, apesar das suspeitas de agressão sexual.
Finalmente, em setembro de 2021, ele foi considerado culpado por organizar um ""sistema"" de exploração sexual de jovens e adolescentes durante anos e foi condenado em junho de 2022 a 30 anos de prisão por um tribunal de Nova York.

(Reuters) – O cantor vencedor do Grammy R. Kelly foi sentenciado nesta quinta-feira a mais um ano de prisão por pornografia infantil e outros crimes, além dos 30 anos de uma condenação anterior em Nova York, informou a mídia norte-americana.
Em uma audiência de 90 minutos, o juiz Harry Leinenweber, do Tribunal Distrital para o norte de Illinois, em Chicago, também ordenou que Kelly cumpra 19 anos simultaneamente com a sentença anterior, relataram uma afiliada local da CBS e outros meios de comunicação.
Em setembro, Kelly foi condenado em um tribunal federal por crime de exploração sexual de uma criança, aliciamento de uma mulher e posse de material contendo pornografia infantil.
No caso anterior em Nova York, Kelly foi condenado por vários crimes, incluindo sexo ilegal com menores e exploração sexual de menores.
No caso de Illinois, os promotores argumentaram que o cantor “é tão incorrigível” que a única maneira de garantir que Kelly não reincida era impor uma sentença que o mantivesse na prisão pelo resto de sua vida. Eles pediram outros 25 anos à sentença de 30 anos.
Os advogados de defesa dizem que Kelly, de 56 anos e que sofre de diabetes, já está enfrentando uma sentença de prisão perpétua com o prazo atual de 30 anos. Eles reconhecem que o juiz deve impor uma sentença mínima de 10 anos, mas afirmam que ela deve ser executada de forma concomitante.
Eles também questionam por que os promotores federais dedicaram tantos recursos para processar um artista negro quando muitas das maiores estrelas brancas da história do rock ‘n’ roll foram acusadas de abusar de meninas menores de idade e “nenhuma foi processada e nenhuma morrerá na prisão”.
A advogada de defesa Jennifer Bonjean alegou um padrão diferente, citando 11 estrelas do rock brancas em seu memorando de sentença que foram acusadas de abusar de meninas menores de idade e ficaram impunes.
Kelly não se dirigiu ao juiz porque ainda enfrenta processos em outras jurisdições e qualquer declaração pode ser usada contra ele, disse Bonjean.

Cantor R. Kelly condenado a 20 anos de prisão por pornografia infantil,"Robert Sylvester Kelly, 56, foi considerado culpado por um júri federal em Chicago pelo crime de produção de pornografia infantil e corrupção de menores
O cantor americano R. Kelly, estrela do R&B que havia sido condenado a 30 anos de prisão por crimes sexuais, foi sentenciado a 20 anos de prisão nessa quinta-feira, 23, por pornografia infantil em um caso separado, em uma corte federal de Chicago.
O juiz Harry Leinenweber ordenou que a maior parte da nova sentença fosse executada concomitantemente, exceto por um ano, que ele expurgaria assim que a anterior, emitida em junho passado em Nova York, fosse cumprida.

Extratos de vídeos que mostram a violência sexual cometida por R. Kelly contra meninas, uma delas de 14 anos, foram divulgados durante o processo.
O cantor, acusado de ter obstruído o desenvolvimento de outro processo anterior por pornografia infantil em 2008, foi absolvido das acusações de obstrução da justiça.
Mundialmente famoso por seu hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"", R. Kelly teve uma carreira de sucesso no R&B, apesar das suspeitas de agressão sexual.
Finalmente, em setembro de 2021, ele foi considerado culpado por organizar um ""sistema"" de exploração sexual de jovens e adolescentes durante anos e foi condenado em junho de 2022 a 30 anos de prisão por um tribunal de Nova York.

Latest sentence offers R Kelly the prospect of being freed from jail one day,"A federal judge on Thursday rejected a call from prosecutors to keep R Kelly behind bars until he is 100, instead telling the Grammy Award-winning R&B singer he would serve all but one of his 20 years on child sex convictions simultaneously with a previous racketeering sentence.
Handed down in a courtroom in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago, the sentence means Kelly could make it out of prison alive, when he is about 80.
Prosecutors had asked Judge Harry Leinenweber to sentence him to 25 years – and to not let him begin serving those until after he completed the first 30-year sentence, imposed on him last year in New York.
“The nature of this offence is horrific,” Judge Leinenweber said in explaining the 20-year sentence. He noted that Kelly’s sexual abuse victims would suffer from his crimes for the rest of their lives.

At the same time, he accepted defence arguments that Kelly might not even make it to 80, so handing him a consecutive lengthy sentence, rather than allowing him to serve all but one year of it simultaneously, did not make much sense.
“He has a life expectancy of not a hell of a lot more,” the judge said. “He is 56 years of age.”
Kelly’s defence lawyer celebrated the ruling as a victory, and some of the singer’s fans could be heard cheering outside the courtroom.
Kelly remained still, his eyes downcast, as Judge Leinenweber explained what was at times a hard-to-follow sentence.
He did seem to show some emotion when a representative read a statement written by “Jane”, one of his accusers and a key prosecution witness.
“I was brainwashed by Robert and a sex slave,” Jane’s statement said. “It almost killed me.”
Kelly did not make a statement in court prior to the sentencing decision, heeding the advice of his lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, to stay quiet while they appeal both his Chicago and New York convictions.
“It’s the right outcome,” Ms Bonjean said. “The judge was reasonable. He, I think, took into account both sides and ultimately was fair.”

The US Attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, conceded that prosecutors were disappointed Kelly did nt receive more consecutive prison time.
But he added, “Twenty years is a significant sentence, and we are happy that that was imposed in this case.”
The judge said at the outset of the hearing that he did not accept the government’s contention that Kelly used fear to woo underage girls for sex, a determination that was important in deciding whether to extend Kelly’s current term significantly.
“The (government’s) whole theory of grooming, was sort of the opposite of fear of bodily harm,” the judge told the court.

“It was the fear of lost love, lost affections (from Kelly)’. It just doesn’t seem to me that it rises to the fear of bodily harm.”
Two of Kelly’s accusers asked the judge to punish him harshly.
“When your virginity is taken by a paedophile at 14 – your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia”, addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly point out her alleged faults while he abused her.
“Now you are here – because there is something wrong with you,” she said. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”

Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly last year on six of 13 counts: three of producing child porn and three of enticement of minors for sex.
Prosecutors did not get a conviction on the marquee charge: that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Kelly rose from poverty in Chicago to become one of the world’s biggest R&B stars. Known for his smash hit I Believe I Can Fly and for sex-infused songs such as Bump n’ Grind, he sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.
Prosecutors described Kelly as “a serial sexual predator” who used his fame and wealth to reel in, sexually abuse and then discard star-struck fans.
US Assistant Attorney Jeannice Appenteng urged the judge to keep Kelly in prison “for the rest of his life”.
Kelly’s abuse of children was especially appalling, she said on Thursday, because he “memorialised” his abuse by filming victims, including Jane.
Ms Appenteng told the court Kelly “used Jane as a sex prop, a thing” for producing pornographic videos.
But Ms Bonjean has accused prosecutors of offering an “embellished narrative” to get the judge to join what she called the government’s “bloodthirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement”.

The singer has suffered enough, including financially, Ms Bonjean said. She said his worth once approached one billion US dollars (£840 million), but that he “is now destitute”.
Given his age and current 30-year sentence, Ms Bonjean said sentencing Kelly to 25 more years would be “overkill”.
“It is symbolic,” she said. “Why? Because it is R Kelly.”
Just before Kelly was taken back to detention on Thursday, he requested that he not be placed on suicide watch because constant checks by guards “is in and of itself cruel” and “creates mental health issues,” Ms Bonjean said.
“He was expecting this,” she told the judge. “Mr Kelly is not suicidal.”",2023-02-23T00:00:00Z,https://www.breakingnews.ie,BreakingNews.ie

R Kelly ordered to serve extra year for sex offences on top of 30-year sentence,"A federal judge on Thursday handed singer R Kelly a 20-year prison sentence for his convictions of child pornography and the enticement of minors for sex but said he will serve nearly all of the sentence simultaneously with a 30-year sentence imposed last year on racketeering charges.
US District Judge Harry Leinenweber also ordered that Kelly serve one year in prison following his New York sentence.
The central question going into the sentencing in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago was whether Leinenweber would order that the 56-year-old serve the sentence simultaneously with or only after he completes the New York term for 2021 racketeering and sex trafficking convictions. The latter would have been tantamount to a life sentence.
Prosecutors had acknowledged that a lengthy term served only after the New York sentence could have erased any chance of Kelly ever getting out of prison alive.

It’s what they asked for, arguing his crimes against children and lack of remorse justified it.
With Thursday’s sentence, though, Kelly will serve no more than 31 years. That means he will be eligible for release at around age 80, providing him some hope of one day leaving prison alive.
In a statement read aloud in court, a woman who testified under the pseudonym “Jane” said she had lost her early aspirations to become a singer herself and her hopes for fulfilling relationships.
“I have lost my dreams to Robert Kelly,” the statement said. “I will never get back what I lost to Robert Kelly. I have been permanently scarred by Robert.”

The woman was a key witness for prosecutors during Kelly’s trial; four of his convictions are tied to her.
“When your virginity is taken by a paedophile at 14 – your life is never your own,” Jane’s statement read.
Another accuser, who used the pseudonym “Nia”, attended the hearing and addressed Kelly directly in court. Speaking forcefully as her voice quivered, Nia said Kelly would repeatedly pick at her supposed faults while he abused her.
“Now you are here – because there is something wrong with you,” she said. “No longer will you be able to harm children.”

She said that while she advised Kelly not to speak because he continues to appeal his convictions and could face other legal action, “He would like to, he would like to very much.”",2023-02-23T00:00:00Z,https://www.breakingnews.ie,BreakingNews.ie
R. Kelly condamné à vingt ans de prison pour pédopornographie,"Le chanteur américain R. Kelly, star déchue du R’n’B, a été condamné jeudi 23 février à une peine de vingt ans de prison pour pédopornographie devant une cour fédérale de Chicago. Cette peine ne s’additionnera pas à celle de trente ans qu’il a reçue en juin 2022 à New York pour des crimes sexuels, le juge Harry Leinenweber ayant ordonné qu’il n’exécute qu’un an de prison supplémentaire quand il aura purgé sa précédente condamnation.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 56 ans, avait été reconnu coupable par un jury fédéral de Chicago de production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur. Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur des jeunes filles, dont l’une n’avait que 14 ans, avaient été diffusés pendant le procès.
Un « système » d’exploitation sexuelle
Le chanteur avait en revanche été acquitté pour des accusations d’obstruction à la justice. Il lui était reproché d’avoir perturbé le déroulement d’un précédent procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, dont il était ressorti non coupable, en menaçant une victime pour qu’elle ne témoigne pas.
L’artiste, mondialement connu pour son tube I Believe I Can Fly et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, avait longtemps régné sur le R’n’B malgré des soupçons d’agressions sexuelles. Il avait finalement été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 d’avoir piloté pendant des années un « système » d’exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes.

Could R. Kelly essentially get a ‘life’ prison sentence?,"Superstar-turned-felon R. Kelly wouldn’t be eligible for release until 2066, a year shy of his 100th birthday, if a federal judge accepts prosecutors’ recommendations at his sentencing hearing Thursday in his hometown of Chicago.
Kelly, 56, will be sentenced on his convictions from last year in Chicago of child pornography and enticement. He is already serving 30 years for his 2021 racketeering and sex trafficking convictions in New York.
The central question for Judge Harry Leinenweber is whether to order that Kelly serve a Chicago sentence simultaneously with the New York sentence or that he start serving his Chicago sentence only after he completes the New York term.
If the singer is ordered to serve the sentences one after the other, that would practically erase any chance of Kelly ever getting out of prison alive.
Here is a look at the potential sentences:
What are prosecutors asking for?
In a sentencing memo last week, they recommended Kelly serve 25 more years and that he serve it consecutively to the New York sentence.
Prosecutors described Kelly as “a serial sexual predator” who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans to sexually abuse and then discard them. They say he’s shown no remorse.
Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly on three counts each of producing child porn and the enticement of minors for sex. Kelly was acquitted of the marquee count alleging he successfully rigged his 2008 state child pornography trial.
Prosecutors acknowledged a 25-year sentence would be higher than sentencing guidelines suggest and that a consecutive sentence would be tantamount to a life sentence.
But they argued Kelly’s “desire to sexually abuse children is insatiable” and such a sentence was required “to protect the community from” him.
What sentence does the defense want?
Kelly’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, asked for a sentence of around 10 years — on the low end of the guideline range.
She also requested in a series of pre-sentence filings that, whatever prison sentence Leinenweber imposes, he allow Kelly to serve it at the same time as the New York sentence.
Bonjean said Kelly’s existing 30-year term alone means he won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80 and that a new consecutive sentence would be a “second life sentence.”
She said an extended sentence for Kelly, who is Black, would also be disproportionate given that, according to her, white rock stars have long gotten away with the behavior for which Kelly was convicted.
What are the criteria for a consecutive sentence?
By statute, the default for judges is to allow defendants to serve their sentences simultaneously — which courts call “concurrently” — which effectively means they serve only the longest sentence imposed.
But if they conclude a defendant’s crimes were particularly egregious, they can decide that the only way to deter such crimes is to order sentences be served one after the other.
Judges are more likely to order a simultaneous sentence to a sentence imposed in a previous case if the crimes in the two cases are related. While prosecutors say Kelly’s victims in the Chicago case are different, the defense says the allegations were substantially the same.
What do prosecutors argue?
They say Kelly’s crimes were particularly egregious because they involved children, enticing girls as young as 14 and 15 for sex.
Making those crimes worse, they say, is that “Kelly sought to memorialize his sexual exploitation” by filming them. Some videos became available online, which exacerbated the harm to society, prosecutors said.
“Because Kelly is Kelly, more people have watched child pornography,” their filing said. “The effects of Kelly’s conduct are wide-ranging, incalculable and irreversible.”
What about the defense?
Bonjean accused prosecutors of offering an “embellished narrative” in their sentencing memo “to inflame the passions of the public and the Court” against Kelly.
She also said they have sought to get the judge to join what she called the government’s “blood-thirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement.”
“The government insists on exaggerating Kelly’s misdeeds, sounding more like a teaser for the next installation of ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ than lawyers,” she said.
That is a reference to Lifetime’s 2019 docu-series, “Surviving R. Kelly” — which featured testimonials by his accusers, including several who testified at the 2022 Chicago trial.
Bonjean also hit back at prosecutors for arguing her client has never expressed remorse. She said Kelly had a right to remain silent as he appeals and that prosecutors shouldn’t be permitted to use her advice to Kelly not to speak as proof he lacks remorse.
She added that Kelly’s own abuse as a child and illiteracy throughout adulthood also justified leniency. That the conduct that led to charges happened decades ago should also be factored in, she said.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, rose from poverty in Chicago to superstardom, with hits like “I Believe I Can Fly” and the sex-infused “Bump n’ Grind.”
Bonjean said Kelly has already suffered enormously for his legal troubles, including financially. She said his worth once approached $1 billion but that he “is now destitute.”
Will Kelly address the court at sentencing?
It’s not clear he will, though he risks Judge Leinenweber holding that against him. Judges often like to hear expressions of remorse at sentencing. Most defendants do speak.
But defendants who are appealing convictions, as Kelly is, sometimes choose not to. Kelly did not speak at his 2022 sentencing in New York.",2023-02-22T19:31:58Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News

R Kelly: Prosecutors ask for singer to serve 25 more years in prison for child pornography convictions,"Prosecutors have asked a judge to give R&B singer R Kelly 25 more years in prison for convictions for child pornography and enticing minors for sex.
It would mean the 56-year-old would not be eligible for release until he was around 100 if the judge agrees to both the 25-year sentence and another government requests Kelly to begin the sentence only after the 30 years he has already begun serving in another case.
The singer, full name Robert Sylvester Kelly, was found guilty last year in Chicago on six of 13 counts - three counts each of producing child pornography and enticing minors for sex.
The Grammy Award-winner had already been convicted in New York of racketeering and sex trafficking and sentenced to 30 years in prison.

""The only way to ensure Kelly does not reoffend is to impose a sentence that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life,"" the filing says.
However, Kelly's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, wrote in a filing last week that even with his existing 30-year New York sentence ""Kelly would have to defy all statistical odds to make it out of prison alive."" She cited data showing the average life expectancy of inmates is 64.
Instead she recommended a sentence of around 10 years, which she said could be served simultaneously with the New York sentence.

Ms Bonjean argued Kelly was singled out for behaviour white rock stars have gotten away with for decades. ""None have been prosecuted and none will die in prison,"" she wrote.
Prosecutors have acknowledged a 25-year sentence in the Chicago case would be even more time than sentencing guidelines recommend, but they argued imposing a long sentence and instructing it to be served only after the New York sentence was appropriate.
""A consecutive sentence is eminently reasonable given the egregiousness of Kelly's conduct,"" the filing argued. ""Kelly's sexual abuse of minors was intentional and prolific.""

A plea for leniency
Ms Bonjean argued traumas throughout Kelly's life, including abuse as a child and illiteracy throughout adulthood, justified leniency in his sentencing.
She said he ""is not an evil monster but a complex (unquestionably troubled) human being who faced overwhelming challenges in childhood that shaped his adult life.""
Kelly is set to be sentenced in Chicago next Thursday.

Les procureurs demandent 25 ans supplémentaires de prison pour R. Kelly,"Les procureurs américains demandent à un juge de condamner le chanteur R. Kelly à 25 ans de prison supplémentaires pour ses condamnations pour pornographie juvénile l’année dernière à Chicago, ce qui ajouterait aux 30 ans qu’il a récemment commencé à purger dans une autre affaire à New York.
L’homme de 56 ans ne serait pas admissible à la libération avant d’avoir environ 100 ans si le juge accepte à la fois la peine de 25 ans et une autre demande du gouvernement que Kelly ne commence à purger sa peine à Chicago qu’après la peine de 30 ans à New York. Dans leur recommandation de condamnation déposée jeudi soir devant le tribunal de district américain de Chicago, les procureurs ont décrit le comportement de Kelly comme « sadique », le qualifiant de « prédateur sexuel en série » sans remords et qui « constitue un grave danger pour la société ».
La condamnation de Kelly à Chicago est prévue jeudi la semaine prochaine. L’avocate de Kelly, Jennifer Bonjean, a écrit dans un dossier la semaine dernière que même avec sa peine actuelle de 30 ans à New York, « Kelly devrait défier toutes les probabilités statistiques pour sortir de prison vivant ». Elle a cité des données selon lesquelles l’espérance de vie moyenne des détenus est de 64 ans.
Elle a recommandé une peine d’environ 10 ans, qui, selon elle, pourrait être purgée simultanément avec la peine de New York. Lors du procès à Chicago l’année dernière, les jurés ont condamné le chanteur lauréat d’un Grammy Award pour six des treize chefs d’accusation. Mais le gouvernement a perdu le décompte de renom selon lequel Kelly et son directeur commercial de l’époque ont réussi à truquer son procès pour pornographie juvénile d’État en 2008.

US prosecutors ask for 25 more years in prison for R. Kelly,"This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate
CHICAGO (AP) — Federal prosecutors Thursday asked a judge to give singer R. Kelly 25 more years in prison for his child pornography and enticement convictions last year in Chicago, which would add to 30 years he recently began serving in a New York case.
The 56-year-old wouldn't be eligible for release until he was around 100 if the judge agrees both to the 25-year sentence and another government request that Kelly begin serving his Chicago sentence only after the 30-year New York sentence is fully served.
In their sentencing recommendation filed late Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago, prosecutors described Kelly's behavior as “sadistic,” calling him “a serial sexual predator” with no remorse and who ""poses a serious danger to society.""
“The only way to ensure Kelly does not reoffend is to impose a sentence that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life,” the 37-page government filing says.
Kelly's sentencing in Chicago is set for Thursday next week.
Kelly's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, wrote in a filing last week that even with his existing 30-year New York sentence, “Kelly would have to defy all statistical odds to make it out of prison alive.” She cited data that the average life expectancy of inmates is 64.
She recommended a sentence of around 10 years, at the low end of the sentencing guidelines range, which she said could be served simultaneously with the New York sentence.
In arguing for the lesser sentence, Bonjean alleged Kelly, who is Black, was singled out for behavior that she said white rock stars have gotten away with for decades.
“None have been prosecuted and none will die in prison,” she wrote.
Prosecutors acknowledged that a 25-year sentence in the Chicago case would be more time than even sentencing guidelines recommend. But they argued imposing a long sentence and instructing it be served only after the New York sentence was appropriate.
“A consecutive sentence is eminently reasonable given the egregiousness of Kelly’s conduct,” the filing argued. “Kelly’s sexual abuse of minors was intentional and prolific.”
At the trial in Chicago last year, jurors convicted the Grammy Award winning singer on six of 13 counts. But the government lost the marquee count that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Both of Kelly's co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid, were acquitted of all charges.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, rose from poverty in Chicago to superstardom, becoming known for smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind.”
While the Grammy Award-winner went to trial in 2008, it wasn’t until after the airing of Lifetime’s 2019 docu-series, “Surviving R. Kelly” — featuring testimonials by his accusers — that criminal investigations were kicked into high-gear, ending with federal and new state charges.
In January, an Illinois judge dismissed state sex-abuse charges prior to a trial on the recommendation of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx. Foxx said she was comfortable dropping the case because Kelly would spend decades in prison for his federal convictions.
Prosecutors at Kelly's federal trial in Chicago portrayed him as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans to sexually abuse, in some cases to video record them, and then discard them.
After deliberating over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement of minors for sex, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
The Chicago verdict came months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence alone, he wouldn't eligible for release until he is around 80.
Even if granted time off for good behavior, Kelly would be only be eligible for release if he serves 25 years after the New York sentence in the year 2066, the government's Thursday filing said.
It will be up to Judge Harry Leinenweber in Chicago to decide the crucial question of whether Kelly serves whatever sentence he imposes concurrently, simultaneously, with the New York sentence or consecutively.
Kelly's legal team is appealing his New York and Chicago convictions. Prosecutors sometimes press for long sentences for defendants sentenced at earlier trials in a bid to ensure that, if some convictions are later tossed, they will still do some time behind bars.
Bonjean argued that traumas throughout Kelly's life, including abuse as a child and illiteracy throughout adulthood, justified leniency in sentencing the singer.
Kelly “is not an evil monster but a complex (unquestionably troubled) human-being who faced overwhelming challenges in childhood that shaped his adult life,” she said.
That the conduct for which he was convicted occurred decades ago should also be factored in, she said.
“While Kelly was not a child in the late 1990s, he also was not the middle-aged man he was at the time of his 2019 indictment,” she argued. “Kelly was a damaged man in his late 20s.”
She added that Kelly has already paid a heavy price from his legal troubles, including a financial one. She said his worth once approached $1 billion but that he “is now destitute.”

Feb. 17 (UPI) -- Prosecutors said this week that they want R&B singer Robert Kelly, best known by his stage name R. Kelly, to serve 25 years in prison for child pornography and other convictions, essentially turning the penalty into a life sentence. This past summer, a federal jury in Chicago found Kelly, 56, guilty of three counts of producing child pornography and three counts of enticing a minor into criminal sexual activity. Advertisement
In a 37-page memo filed a week before U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber is expected to sentence the one-time entertainment star, prosecutors argued that Kelly should not start serving that sentence until his 30-year racketeering conviction in New York is completed, amounting to 55 years in federal prison.
""Robert Kelly is a serial sexual predator who, over the course of many years, specifically targeted young girls and went to great lengths to conceal his abuse,"" prosecutors wrote, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
Kelly's defense has asked for an 11-year sentence, to run at the same time as his New York conviction. His defense said that Kelly is being singled out for behavior that ""White rock stars have gotten away with for decades.""

"Feds want 25 more years in jail for R. Kelly on Chicago conviction, saying he’s shown no remorse for years of sexual abuse","Federal prosecutors in Chicago are asking for a 25-year consecutive prison sentence for R. Kelly for his conviction last year on child pornography charges, saying he’s a “serial sexual predator” who has shown no remorse for his crimes and tried to blame his victims for their own abuse.
In requesting that Kelly’s sentence run consecutively to the 30-year term he already received for a racketeering conviction in New York, prosecutors are essentially asking U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber to ensure that the Chicago-born R&B superstar will die in prison.

In their 37-page filing late Thursday, prosecutors blasted allegations by Kelly’s attorneys that other famous and mostly white musicians who had relationships with underage girls were given a pass by the government.
“(Kelly) not only refuses to accept any responsibility for his conduct, but he repeatedly deflects any blame for his crimes, and instead advocates that he is being treated unfairly because, for example, ‘other artists and musicians’ should be prosecuted for these crimes,” Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeannice Appenteng, Elizabeth Pozolo, Jason Julien, and Brian Williamson wrote. “Plain and simple, Kelly does not comprehend that what he did was wrong.”

The prosecutors also wrote that a consecutive sentence was necessary to “protect the community from Kelly, as he has shown no signs of rehabilitation.”
Kelly, 56, was convicted by a jury in September on charges including child pornography related to his years of sexual abuse of his goddaughter, “Jane,” as well as sexual misconduct with two other girls. He was acquitted, however, of the explosive allegations that he and others conspired to rig his initial Cook County trial in 2008.
A jury in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn found Kelly guilty in 2021 of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging his musical career doubled as a criminal enterprise aimed at satisfying his predatory sexual desires.
The government’s sentencing memo illustrated the stark contrasts Leinenweber will have to sort through at Kelly’s sentencing hearing at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse on Thursday.
While Kelly faces anywhere from 10 to 90 years for the Chicago conviction, the calculus that matters most is whether Leinenweber makes the sentence consecutive to Kelly’s sentence in New York, which would virtually guarantee he would never be released.
Kelly’s lawyers have asked for a concurrent sentence of about 11 years in prison, arguing that a consecutive term would be overkill and ignore significant mitigating factors, including Kelly’s own traumatic upbringing and the fact that many of the abuse allegations in the case were decades old.
Jennifer Bonjean, Kelly’s lead attorney, also argued in her filing last week that the federal government’s “obsession with ensuring that Kelly dies in prison” is troubling given that other famous and mostly white musicians — including Elvis Presley — were given a pass despite “credible histories of sexually abusing underage women.”
Presley met his future wife Priscilla in Germany in 1959, when she was 14 and he was 24. They began dating with her parents’ approval and he married her five years later after she became an adult.

Kelly’s five-week trial in Chicago featured some 34 witnesses. The jury was shown clips from three separate videos made in the 1990s allegedly depicting Kelly abusing Jane, including the same tape from his Cook County trial as well as another where he instructed her to refer repeatedly to her “14-year-old” genitalia.
Jane, as she was know in the trial, testified for the first time that not only was it her on the videotapes, but that Kelly had sexually abused her “innumerable” times when she was a minor, at his recording studio, his home, on tour buses and in hotel rooms.
Asked on the witness stand why, after two decades of silence, she finally decided to come forward and speak out, Jane said: “I became exhausted with living with (Kelly’s) lies.”
The jury’s split verdict came 14 years after Kelly’s infamous acquittal on similar charges in Cook County, which were based on a single video of Kelly allegedly abusing Jane in the hot tub room of his former home on West George Street. Jane had refused to cooperate in that case.
Kelly was also found guilty on three out of five counts related to enticement of a minor involving Jane and two other victims who came forward to testify against him.
But in a rare loss for federal prosecutors, the jury acquitted Kelly and two co-defendants on sensational charges they conspired to retrieve incriminating tapes and rig his 2008 trial by pressuring Jane to lie to investigators about their relationship and refuse to testify against him.

Kelly was also found not guilty of filming himself with Jane on a video that jurors never saw. Prosecutors said “Video 4″ was not played because Kelly’s team successfully buried it, but defense attorneys questioned whether it existed at all.
Bonjean is appealing Kelly’s conviction and sentence in Brooklyn’s federal court, where an appellate brief is due next month. She’s also planning to appeal his conviction in Chicago to the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.
Other than those appeals, which could take years, Kelly’s long legal road appears to be coming to an end. Last month, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced she was dropping four separate Cook County indictments against Kelly, in part to conserve resources given his two federal convictions.
Kelly is also facing a charge of solicitation in Minnesota, though no trial date has ever been set in that case and the likelihood of it moving forward would appear to be very remote.
Bonjean’s sentencing memo filed last week delved deeply into Kelly’s own traumatic childhood in Chicago, including being shot in the arm at age 14 while riding his bike, witnessing frequent domestic violence, and being repeatedly sexually abused by a sister and family friend.

“Kelly was a damaged man in his late 20s with an extraordinarily traumatic childhood that he failed to confront,” Bonjean wrote. “He lacked the insights or ability to appreciate the ways in which his traumatic childhood impacted his unhealthy sexual development and harmful choices.”

While prosecutors alleged Kelly sexually groomed Jane and other vulnerable teen girls, Bonjean characterized Kelly’s relationships as more complicated, noting that both Jane and her friend, “Pauline,” acknowledged on the witness stand that at times they felt love for him.
Jane told the jury she “felt good” about their initial interactions, Bonjean’s memo stated, and that she felt “that he loved me, that he would take care of me, that he was my protector.”
“Jane did not say she feared Kelly or that he said or did anything to instill any type of fear in her that caused her to have sexual contact with him,” Bonjean wrote.
But prosecutors in their filing Thursday said Kelly “brazenly blames his victims” while refusing to accept responsibility for his crimes.
“At the age of 56 years old, Kelly’s lack of remorse and failure to grasp the gravity of his criminal conduct against children demonstrates that he poses a serious danger to society,” prosecutors said .

Nog eens 25 jaar cel geëist tegen Amerikaanse zanger R. Kelly,"AFP Kelly tijdens een eerdere zitting in 2019
NOS Nieuws • vandaag, 12:02 • Aangepast vandaag, 13:13 Nog eens 25 jaar cel geëist tegen Amerikaanse zanger R. Kelly
Aanklagers in Chicago eisen nog eens 25 jaar gevangenisstraf tegen zanger R. Kelly voor zes misdrijven waaronder het produceren van kinderporno en het verleiden van minderjarigen tot seks. Een jury heeft hem al schuldig verklaard.
Robert Sylvester Kelly (55) wordt al sinds de jaren 90 beschuldigd van (kinder)misbruik en zit sinds 2019 vast. Vorig jaar werd hij in New York al veroordeeld voor het leiden van een organisatie die tot doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken.
Hij kreeg daarvoor 30 jaar celstraf opgelegd door een federale rechter in New York. Een nieuwe straf komt daar bovenop. De rechter in Chicago bepaalt de strafmaat volgende week donderdag.
Grote hits
In de nieuwe zaak wordt Kelly's gedrag ""sadistisch"" genoemd. Ook beschrijven de aanklagers hem als ""een seksueel roofdier"" zonder spijt, die ""een ernstig gevaar vormt voor de samenleving"", schrijft persbureau AP.
Kelly komt op basis van de eerste straf uit New York pas in aanmerking voor vrijlating als hij 25 jaar daarvan heeft uitgezeten.
Kelly scoorde in de jaren 90 grote hits zoals I believe I can fly. Hij verkocht miljoenen albums, ook nadat de geruchten over misbruik begonnen te circuleren.
Surviving R. Kelly
Hoewel de Grammy Award-winnaar in 2008 al voor de rechter stond, was het pas na de uitzending van de documentaireserie uit 2019, Surviving R. Kelly - met getuigenissen van zijn slachtoffers - dat het strafrechtelijke onderzoek tegen hem in een stroomversnelling kwam.",2023-02-17T11:02:57Z,https://nos.nl,NOS

R. Kelly convicted of six of 13 counts, but two associates are acquitted
Federal prosecutors Thursday asked a judge to give singer R. Kelly 25 more years in prison for his child pornography and enticement convictions last year in Chicago, which would add to 30 years he recently began serving in a New York case.
The 56-year-old wouldn't be eligible for release until he was around 100 if the judge agrees both to the 25-year sentence and another government request that Kelly begin serving his Chicago sentence only after the 30-year New York sentence is fully served.
In their sentencing recommendation filed before midnight Thursday in U.S. District Court in Chicago, prosecutors described Kelly's behavior as ""sadistic,"" calling him ""a serial sexual predator"" with no remorse who ""poses a serious danger to society.""
""The only way to ensure Kelly does not reoffend is to impose a sentence that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life,"" the 37-page government filing says.
Kelly's sentencing in Chicago is set for Thursday next week.

Kelly's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, wrote in a filing last week that even with his existing 30-year New York sentence, ""Kelly would have to defy all statistical odds to make it out of prison alive."" She cited data that the average life expectancy of inmates is 64.
She recommended a sentence of around 10 years, at the low end of the sentencing guidelines range, which she said could be served simultaneously with the New York sentence.
In arguing for the lesser sentence, Bonjean alleged Kelly, who is Black, was singled out for behavior that she said white rock stars have gotten away with for decades.
""None have been prosecuted and none will die in prison,"" she wrote.
Prosecutors acknowledged that a 25-year sentence in the Chicago case would be more time than even sentencing guidelines recommend. But they argued for imposing a long sentence and instructing it be served only after the New York sentence was appropriate.
""A consecutive sentence is eminently reasonable given the egregiousness of Kelly's conduct,"" the filing argued. ""Kelly's sexual abuse of minors was intentional and prolific.""
At the trial in Chicago last year, jurors convicted the Grammy Award winning singer on six of 13 counts. But the government lost the marquee count that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Both of Kelly's co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid, were acquitted of all charges.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, rose from poverty in Chicago to superstardom, becoming known for smash hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"" and sex-infused songs such as ""Bump n' Grind.""
While the Grammy Award-winner went to trial in 2008, it wasn't until after the airing of Lifetime's 2019 docu-series, ""Surviving R. Kelly"" — featuring testimonials by his accusers — that criminal investigations were kicked into high-gear, ending with federal and new state charges.
In January, an Illinois judge dismissed state sex-abuse charges prior to a trial on the recommendation of Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx. Foxx said she was comfortable dropping the case because Kelly would spend decades in prison for his federal convictions.
Prosecutors at Kelly's federal trial in Chicago portrayed him as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans to sexually abuse and, in some cases, record them on video, and then discard them.
After deliberating over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement of minors for sex, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
The Chicago verdict came months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence alone, he wouldn't eligible for release until he is around 80.
Even if granted time off for good behavior, Kelly would be only be eligible for release if he serves 25 years after the New York sentence in the year 2066, the government's Thursday filing said.
It will be up to Judge Harry Leinenweber in Chicago to decide the crucial question of whether Kelly serves whatever sentence he imposes concurrently, simultaneously, with the New York sentence or consecutively.
Kelly's legal team is appealing his New York and Chicago convictions. Prosecutors sometimes press for long sentences for defendants sentenced at earlier trials in a bid to ensure that, if some convictions are later tossed, they will still do some time behind bars.
Bonjean argued that traumas throughout Kelly's life, including abuse as a child and illiteracy throughout adulthood, justified leniency in sentencing the singer.
Kelly ""is not an evil monster but a complex (unquestionably troubled) human-being who faced overwhelming challenges in childhood that shaped his adult life,"" she said.
That the conduct for which he was convicted occurred decades ago should also be factored in, she said.
""While Kelly was not a child in the late 1990s, he also was not the middle-aged man he was at the time of his 2019 indictment,"" she argued. ""Kelly was a damaged man in his late 20s.""
She added that Kelly has already paid a heavy price from his legal troubles, including a financial one. She said his worth once approached $1 billion but that he ""is now destitute.""",2023-02-17T08:27:29Z,https://www.cbsnews.com,CBS News

US prosecutors ask for 25 more years in prison for R Kelly,"US prosecutors have asked a judge to give singer R Kelly 25 more years in prison for his child pornography and enticement convictions last year in Chicago, which would add to 30 years he recently began serving in a New York case.
The 56-year-old would not be eligible for release until he was around 100 if the judge agreed to the 25-year sentence and another government request that Kelly begin serving his Chicago sentence only after the 30-year New York sentence is fully served.
In their sentencing recommendation filed on Thursday in US District Court in Chicago, prosecutors described Kelly’s behaviour as “sadistic”, calling him “a serial sexual predator” with no remorse and who “poses a serious danger to society”.
“The only way to ensure Kelly does not reoffend is to impose a sentence that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life,” the 37-page government filing says.

The sentencing in Chicago is set for Thursday next week.
Kelly lawyer Jennifer Bonjean wrote in a filing last week that even with his existing 30-year New York sentence, “Kelly would have to defy all statistical odds to make it out of prison alive”. She cited data that the average life expectancy of inmates is 64.
She recommended a sentence of around 10 years, at the low end of the sentencing guidelines range, and said it should be served simultaneously with the New York sentence.
In arguing for the lesser sentence, Ms Bonjean alleged Kelly, who is black, was singled out for behaviour that white rock stars have got away with for decades.
“None have been prosecuted and none will die in prison,” she wrote.
Prosecutors acknowledged that a 25-year sentence in the Chicago case would be more time than even sentencing guidelines recommend, but they argued that imposing a long sentence and instructing it be served only after the New York sentence was appropriate.
“A consecutive sentence is eminently reasonable given the egregiousness of Kelly’s conduct,” the filing argued. “Kelly’s sexual abuse of minors was intentional and prolific.”
At the trial in Chicago last year, jurors convicted the Grammy Award-winning singer on six of 13 counts, but the government lost the marquee count that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.

While he went to trial in 2008, it was not until after the airing of 2019 docu-series Surviving R Kelly — featuring testimonials by his accusers — that criminal investigations were kicked into high-gear, ending with federal and new state charges.
In January, an Illinois judge dismissed state sex abuse charges prior to a trial on the recommendation of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, who said she was comfortable dropping the case because Kelly would spend decades in prison for his federal convictions.
Prosecutors at Kelly’s federal trial in Chicago portrayed him as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in starstruck fans to sexually abuse, in some cases to video them, and then discard them.
After deliberating over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement of minors for sex, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, production of child pornography and three counts of receiving child pornography.

The Chicago verdict came months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence alone, he would not eligible for release until he was around 80.
Even if granted time off for good behaviour, Kelly would be only be eligible for release if he served 25 years after the New York sentence in the year 2066, the government’s Thursday filing said.

R. Kelly is denied motions for acquittal and new federal trial,"Singer and convicted sex offender R. Kelly has been denied all motions for acquittal and a new federal trial, Chicago Federal Judge Harry Leinenweber ruled on Thursday.
Kelly, 56, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2022 on nine counts that included ""sexual exploitation of children"" and ""transportation of women and girls in interstate commerce to engage in illegal sexual activity."" He was convicted of three child pornography charges and three counts of child enticement in Chicago last year.
The disgraced singer's attorneys filed the motion for a new trial on Feb. 4, stating that the main witness in the trial misled jurors when she said she was undecided on whether she would be seeking monetary damages from the case. The motion was denied less than two weeks later.
The anonymous star witness, known only as ""Jane,"" testified that Kelly began sexually abusing her when she was just 14 years old, even filming their encounters.
""Simply because Jane and her attorney considered the possibility of restitution does not mean she lied during her testimony,"" wrote Leinenweber. ""Jane's testimony was that she was undecided. Her testimony was not that she was not intending to pursue restitution.""

Lawyers for R. Kelly early Friday asked a federal judge in Chicago to sentence the disgraced R&B singer to about 11 years in prison for his conviction last year for repeatedly sexually abusing his teenage goddaughter and others on videotape decades ago.
In a court filing early Friday, Kelly’s lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, wrote the singer is already facing what amounts to the rest of his life in prison given the 30-year term handed down for his conviction on racketeering charges in New York in 2021.

Any additional prison time he receives for his Chicago case should be served concurrently, Bonjean wrote in arguing for a sentence of as little as 132 months -- the low end of federal guidelines.
“Such a sentence punishes Kelly for conduct that is over a quarter-century old while taking into account his individual characteristics that include his own horrific child sexual abuse that shaped him and provides some explanation (not an excuse) for the conduct that underlies his convictions in this case,” Bonjean wrote in the filing.

Kelly, 56, was convicted by a jury in September on charges including child pornography related to his years of sexual abuse of “Jane,” and two other girls. He was acquitted, however, of the explosive allegations that he rigged his initial Cook County trial in 2008.
Kelly has already been sentenced to 30 years after a jury in New York found him guilty of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging his musical career doubled as a criminal enterprise aimed at satisfying his predatory sexual desires.
Prosecutors are expected to file their sentencing recommendation next week. Kelly is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber on Feb. 23.
Bonjean wrote in her 34-page memo that the federal government’s “obsession with ensuring that Kelly dies in prison” is troubling given that other famous and mostly white musicians -- including Elvis Presley -- were given a pass despite “credible histories of sexually abusing underage women.”
Kelly’s five-week trial in Chicago featured some 34 witnesses. The jury was shown clips from three separate videos made in the 1990s allegedly depicting Kelly abusing Jane, including the same tape from his Cook County trial as well as another where he instructed her to refer repeatedly to her “14-year-old” genitalia.
Jane testified for the first time that not only was it her on the videotapes, but that Kelly had sexually abused her “innumerable” times when she was a minor, at his recording studio, his home, on tour buses and in hotel rooms.
Asked on the witness stand why, after two decades of silence, she finally decided to come forward and speak out, Jane said: “I became exhausted with living with (Kelly’s) lies.”
The jury’s split verdict came 14 years after Kelly’s infamous acquittal on similar charges in Cook County, which were based on a single video of Kelly allegedly abusing Jane in the hot tub room of his former home on West George Street. Jane had refused to cooperate in that case.

Kelly was also found guilty on three out of five counts related to enticement of a minor involving Jane, as she was known in the trial, and two other victims who came forward to testify against him.

But in a rare loss for federal prosecutors, the jury acquitted Kelly and two co-defendants on sensational charges they conspired to retrieve incriminating tapes and rig his 2008 trial by pressuring Jane to lie to investigators about their relationship and refuse to testify against him.
After about 11 hours of deliberation, the jury of seven women and five men also acquitted Kelly and his two former associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, of conspiring to receive the footage that was shown in court. Jurors apparently determined that while the videos they saw were authentic, they could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that Kelly’s team schemed to get them back or even knowingly obtained them.
Kelly was also found not guilty of filming himself with Jane on a video that jurors never saw. Prosecutors said “Video 4″ was not played because Kelly’s team successfully buried it, but defense attorneys questioned whether it existed at all.
Kelly faces up to 90 years behind bars for the Chicago conviction, though sentencing guidelines call for far less. Leinenweber also has the discretion to order his sentence to be served consecutively to the term imposed in New York, which would virtually endure the singer would remain behind bars for the rest of his life.
Bonjean is appealing Kelly’s conviction and sentence in Brooklyn’s federal court, where an appellate brief is due next month. She’s also planned to appeal his conviction in Chicago to the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.

R. Kelly-Already Facing 30 Years In Prison-Asks For Lighter Sentence For Porn Conviction,"Topline
Attorneys for singer R. Kelly on Friday asked a federal judge in Chicago to limit the sentence for the disgraced singer to 11 years in prison for his conviction last year on child pornography and enticement charges—the latest in a saga of legal issues following his 30-year sentence in a separate case in New York on sex trafficking and racketeering charges last June.

Key Facts
In a court filing, attorney Jennifer Bonjean, who represents Kelly, asked for the singer’s sentencing to be served concurrently with his 30-year sentence, arguing Kelly is already facing what amounts to a life sentence, the Chicago Tribune reported. Kelly, 56, was convicted last September on six counts, including child pornography and child enticement, for allegedly coercing three underage girls into having sex following a five-week trial that included 34 witnesses—though he was acquitted on seven other counts brought by prosecutors on charges of receiving child pornography. It comes eight months after Kelly was sentenced in New York City to 30 years after he was found guilty of violating the federal Mann Act, for trafficking women across state lines, with one victim saying she hopes he is imprisoned for “the rest of his life.” Bonjean did not respond to a Forbes inquiry for comment, but said in a statement obtained by the Chicago Tribune that the sentence “punishes Kelly for conduct that is over a quarter-century old.”
Big Number
90 years. That’s the maximum sentence Kelly faces in Illinois, with a minimum sentence of 10 years, just one year less than Kelly’s attorneys are asking for.
Contra
Bonjean has made the argument in previous trials that Kelly faced “horrific” sexual abuse as a child that “shaped him and provides some explanation” for the allegations of a history of sexual assault and misconduct against him, clarifying that Kelly’s history as a child does not serve as an excuse.
Key Background
The disgraced R&B star and three-time Grammy winner has faced allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct for nearly three decades, beginning with his marriage in 1994 at the age of 24 to late singer Aaliyah, who was only 15 at the time. Kelly also faced a lawsuit from his ex-wife Tiffany Hawkins in 1996 for having sex with her years earlier when she was under 18, which Kelly settled for $250,000. In 2002, he was charged with 21 counts of child pornography, but was acquitted in 2008 and didn’t face additional charges until 2019, when he was charged with 18 counts of abuse, and convicted in 2021.
Tangent
State prosecutors in Illinois last month dropped additional sex-abuse charges against Kelly involving four victims, including three minors, with Cook County Attorney Kim Fox arguing his 30-year sentence in New York and additional sentencing stemming from the case in Illinois have already indicated “justice has been served.”
What To Watch For
Kelly’s sentencing hearing in federal District Court in Chicago starts February 23. Prosecutors in the case are expected to file recommendations for Kelly’s sentencing next week, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Attorneys for imprisoned singer R. Kelly alleged in a new court filing that the star witness against him in his federal trial in Chicago last year lied to the jury about her plans to seek millions of dollars in restitution from Kelly upon his conviction.
The long-shot motion filed Saturday asked U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber to throw out Kelly’s conviction on all counts related to “Jane,” his former goddaughter who testified that Kelly repeatedly sexually abused her on videotape when she was a teenager.
Advertisement
Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, argued in the eight-page filing that Jane falsely denied under oath that she had made a decision about whether she would seek restitution from Kelly. Prosecutors also misled the jury by failing to correct Jane’s testimony, Bonjean said.
When she was asked about it on cross-examination in August, Jane testified she was aware she could seek money from Kelly if he was found guilty, but that she was, “still undecided with that.”

“You haven’t decided whether you’re going to seek restitution?” Bonjean asked Jane at trial, to which she responded, “No.”
In truth, Bonjean wrote, Jane had already hired a Boston-based lawyer and a team of experts to present a restitution package to Leinenweber asking for a “whopping” $13 million.
“She knew full well she was seeking restitution in an extraordinary amount if (Kelly) was convicted,” “Bonjean wrote. “The government knew it too.”
Bonjean attached the lawyer’s receipt for legal services showing he’d billed Jane nearly $55,000 for his services — costs that prosecutors are now saying Kelly should pay.

Like other post-trial motions filed by Kelly’s legal team, Leinenweber is almost certain to deny this latest attempt to get the conviction tossed. But the motion preserves arguments that likely will be made later in an appeal to the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.
Kelly, 56, was convicted by a jury in September on charges including child pornography related to his years of sexual abuse of “Jane,” and other girls. He was acquitted, however, of the explosive allegations that he rigged his initial Cook County trial in 2008.
Leinenweber has set sentencing for Feb. 23, where Kelly will face anywhere from 10 to 90 years behind bars.
Kelly has already been sentenced to 30 years after a jury in New York found him guilty of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging his musical career doubled as a criminal enterprise aimed at satisfying his predatory sexual desires.

Kelly Clarkson’s Got The ’90s R&B Flow with Mark Morrison Cover: Watch,"Kelly’s got the flow. For her Thursday (Feb. 2) Kellyoke performance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Kelly Clarkson dusted off one of the most memorable R&B songs from the ’90s: Mark Morrison’s “Return of the Mack.”
Explore Explore Kelly Clarkson See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news
Dressed in all black, the three-time Grammy winner and her backup band looked just as sleek and cool as Morrison purports to be in his greatest hit’s suave lyrics. “Well I tried to tell you so, but I guess you didn’t know/ As I said the story goes, baby, now I got the flow,” Clarkson sang, accompanied by a backup singer providing extra vocals for the call and response-like choruses in “Return of the Mack.”
“(Return of the Mack) come on/ (Return of the Mack) oh my God/ (You know that I’ll be back) here I am.”
An ultra-catchy, confidence-boosting song about bouncing back from a breakup, “Return of the Mack” is, by far, the most successful song Morrison ever released. Released in 1996 as a single and title track from the British singer’s debut album — also titled Return of the Mack — it peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. And as much of a hit as it was at the time of its release, “Return of the Mack” is still an attention-grabber in the 21st century, having been named the most-tagged TV show song by Shazam in November 2015 after being featured in Aziz Ansari’s Netflix show Master of None.

R. Kelly received a 30-year sentence in 2022
R. Kelly’s charges were brought in the aftermath of Lifetime premiering its docuseries Surviving R. Kelly, which chronicled Kelly’s years of abuse in the words of some of the survivors themselves. After Surviving R. Kelly, Kelly was charged in Chicago with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse in February 2019, followed by another 11 charges in May. (In March 2019, he gave his now-infamous interview with Gayle King where he asserted his innocence, exclaiming, “I’m fighting for my f***ing life.”) In July 2019, a Chicago grand jury indicted him on 13 counts, including child pornography, enticement of a minor, and obstruction of justice.
In 2021, a New York jury found Kelly guilty on charges including sexual exploitation of a child, racketeering, bribery, and sex trafficking. The jury found that the prosecutors proved Kelly was at the head of a criminal conspiracy to recruit and coerce girls, boys, and women into sex. In 2022, he received a sentence of 30 years in prison.
R. Kelly’s abuse charges in Chicago were dropped
Kelly has continued to face charges after his sentencing in New York, including a case in Chicago involving the sexual abuse of four people, three of whom were minors. But in January 2023, the prosecutorial team decided to drop the charges.
According to the Associated Press, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced that she would ask a judge to dismiss the indictments Kelly was facing. Foxx, who back in 2019 had asked women and girls with stories about Kelly to come forward so she could bring charges against him, acknowledged that her decision “may be disappointing” to his accusers who told their stories.
“Mr. Kelly is potentially looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again for the crimes that he’s committed,” the prosecutor said, referring to Kelly’s federal convictions. “While today’s cases are no longer being pursued, we believe justice has been served.”
Reactions to the case being dropped
Kelly’s attorney Jennifer Bonjean was “pleased” with the prosecution’s decision to drop the charges and leave her client alone. “He only has one life to give. So I don’t know how many sentences upon sentences would satisfy people,” she said.
Meanwhile, Lanita Carter, who claimed she was sexually assaulted by R. Kelly in 2003, said she was “extremely disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.”I have spent nearly 20 years hoping that my abuser would be brought to justice for what he did to me. With today’s announcement, all hope of justice for my case is gone,” she said, adding that she trusted Foxx and her office with her story and the hope that she would bring him to justice. “Justice has been denied for me,” she said.

Kim Foxx has announced she will not take the case against R. Kelly to trial due to limited resources. What a travesty this is to the ladies he abused over the years, as he will not have to face them in court. Not only did it take the female accusers a great deal of courage to finally come forward, but now they are not going to get their day in court. Since when do we not prosecute criminals because of limited resources? Once again, the Cook County criminal justice system reflects just what a sad system it is and changes need to be made.

R Kelly condamné pour crimes sexuels : le procureur abandonne les charges,"Plusieurs femmes ont de nouveau porté plainte contre R Kelly. Le procureur a décidé d’abandonner les charges. Découvrez pourquoi.
Le chanteur s’est tout d’abord fait connaitre pour ses tubes tels que I Believe I Can Fly ou bien encore Ignition. En juin dernier, la star a de nouveau fait parler en étant au cœur de plusieurs affaires de crimes sexuels. R Kelly a en effet été accusé de viols, d’enlèvements, d’extorsions, de corruption, d’agressions sexuelles ou bien encore de pédopornographie. Des faits qui se seraient déroulés entre 1994 et 2018 d’après les plaintes collectées. En septembre 2021, l’artiste a été reconnu coupable de neuf chefs d’accusation. En juin dernier, la sentence est finalement tombée. R Kelly a été condamné à 30 ans de prison pour crimes sexuels.
Après que le verdict a été prononcé, plusieurs victimes ont décidé de porter plainte contre le chanteur dans d’autres états du pays. À Chicago, R Kelly a été accusé d’avoir abusé sexuellement de quatre personnes, dont trois qui étaient mineures. Kim Foxx, procureur de Chicago, a toutefois demandé au juge d’abandonner les charges contre l’artiste. Selon lui, le rappeur n’aurait plus jamais « la possibilité de sortir de prison ». Une décision qui a profondément bouleversé les plaignantes. D’après Kim Foxx, elles auraient toutefois déclaré que « justice a été faite ».
R Kelly ne se sent pas soulagé de cette décision

En effet, son avocate, Jennifer Bonjean, a confié : « Il n’y a pas vraiment de soulagement. Il se bat toujours pour sa vie. Il en a encore pour des décennies de prison ». R Kelly a déjà été condamné dans l’état de New-York pour ses 30 ans de prison. Cette peine pourrait être prolongée suite à son procès dans l’état de l’Illinois. Le verdict devrait tomber courant du mois de février. Sa peine pourrait se rallonger de 10 à 90 ans de prison.

Ce mardi 31 janvier, les procureurs de l'Illinois ont décidé d'abandonner les accusations d'agression sexuelle criminelle aggravée et d'abus sexuel criminel aggravé qui pesaient sur le chanteur de R&B et qui impliquaient quatre victimes présumées.

Mon bureau dirigera nos ressources pour trouver justice pour les autres victimes d'abus sexuels"", continuait-il. L'une des victimes présumées de R Kelly, Lanita Carter, a réagi dans la foulée ""J'ai passé près de 20 ans à espérer que mon agresseur serait traduit en justice pour ce qu'il m'a fait. Avec l'annonce d'aujourd'hui, tout espoir de justice pour mon cas a disparu, a-t-elle regretté. La justice a été refusée pour moi."" Si les procureurs ont décidé d'abandonner ces nouvelles poursuites, c'est en partie parce que le rappeur purge actuellement une longue peine de prison et attend une nouvelle condamnation d'ici quelques semaines.
R Kelly ""ne devrait jamais sortir de prison""

R. Kelly Reacts To Prosecutor Dropping Sex Abuse Charges,"R Kelly isn’t relieved, despite prosecutors dropping sex abuse charges.
Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said she wants to dismiss sex abuse charges against R Kelly, though this news isn’t necessarily a relief to the embattled singer.

Per TMZ, the singer’s rep, Jennifer Bonjean, said she spoke to him following Foxx’s decision. Though she praised the State’s Attorney’s move, she said Kelly continues to face the reality of remaining behind bars for the rest of his life.
Foxx revealed that her decision to reel back from pursuing these charges against Kelly were due to numerous factors, including the cost. Additionally, she said that the federal court already convicted him on two similar counts. “[R. Kelly] is looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again,” she said. “We believe justice has been served,” she added.
Though the sex abuse charges aren’t necessarily weighing on Kelly’s shoulders, there’s still a good chance he won’t be free anytime soon. “There is no real sense of relief. He is still fighting for his life. He is facing decades in prison,” Bonjean said, adding that Foxx made “the right move” to drop the charges.

Prosecutors accused Kelly of sexually abusing four people, three of which were minors at the time.
During his New York trial, a judge sentenced Kelly to 30 years behind bars. However, his sentencing in Illinois takes place in February and could lead to an additional 10 to 90 years behind bars. Sexual abuse charges or not, Kelly won’t be coming home anytime soon.

Judge drops R. Kelly sex-abuse charges at prosecutor's wish,"Claire Savage, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - A judge dismissed sex-abuse charges against R&B singer R. Kelly on Tuesday based on the recommendation of a Chicago prosecutor.
The hearing lasted just minutes and came a day after Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said she was comfortable dropping the case because Kelly will spend decades in prison for separate convictions in federal court.
Kelly was awaiting trial on state charges of sexually abusing four people in the Chicago area, three of whom were minors. He was not present when Judge Lawrence Flood dismissed the indictments.
Federal juries in Chicago and New York have convicted Kelly of a raft of crimes, including child pornography, enticement, racketeering and sex trafficking related to allegations that he victimized women and girls.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is serving a 30-year prison sentence in the New York case and awaits sentencing on Feb. 23 in Chicago federal court.
Foxx acknowledged Monday that some Kelly accusers would be disappointed. Indeed, Lanita Carter said justice was “denied for me.”
“I have spent nearly 20 years hoping that my abuser would be brought to justice for what he did to me,” Carter said Monday.
Another sexual-misconduct case is pending in Hennepin County, Minnesota, where the Grammy Award-winner faces solicitation charges. Prosecutors haven't said whether they still intend to take Kelly to trial.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n' Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He beat child pornography charges in Chicago in 2008, when a jury acquitted him.
Widespread outrage over Kelly's sexual misconduct didn't emerge until the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 release of the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”

Geen opluchting bij R. Kelly na ingetrokken aanklacht,"Bij R. Kelly is er ""geen gevoel van opluchting"" nu in de Amerikaanse staat Illinois zijn aanklachten voor seksueel misbruik zijn komen te vervallen. Dat laat zijn advocaat weten aan entertainmentsite TMZ in reactie op het nieuws dat maandag bekend is geworden. De openbaar aanklager maakte bekend dat de aanklachten tegen de al veroordeelde zanger zijn ingetrokken omdat het recht al ""heeft geschied"".
Jennifer Bonjean, Kelly's advocaat, zegt dat hij desondanks niet opgelucht is door het nieuws. Volgens haar ""vecht"" de 56-jarige zanger, die naar verluidt kampt met gezondheidsproblemen, voor zijn leven. ""En er staan hem decennia in de gevangenis te wachten."" Wel voegt ze eraan toe dat de openbaar aanklager ""de juiste keuze"" heeft gemaakt.
R. Kelly zit momenteel een celstraf van 30 jaar uit nadat hij vorig jaar in New York werd veroordeeld in een misbruikzaak. Vorig najaar oordeelde een jury in Chicago dat de Amerikaanse zanger ook daar schuldig is aan seksuele misdrijven. In die zaak doet de rechter eind februari uitspraak. Kelly riskeert daar nog eens 10 tot 90 jaar gevangenisstraf.",2023-01-31T17:22:03Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen
‘My case matters’: R. Kelly accuser opens up about waiting for justice and pain over charges being dropped,"Lanita Carter, one of the accusers of R. Kelly, before speaking on Jan. 30, 2023, about her assault and the decision by Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx not to pursue the case. (Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune)
Lanita Carter first told police and prosecutors two decades ago that R. Kelly sexually abused her. No charges were filed. She tried to move on, she said. She raised her children, she found a stable career, but Kelly’s music followed her.
“Every wedding I went to, every graduation I went to, every party,” Carter told the Tribune. When her son’s kindergarten class learned to sing Kelly’s smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly,” she had to help him rehearse.

Carter thought justice was finally catching up with Kelly in 2019, when the docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” resurrected interest in the singer’s alleged misdeeds and Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx put out a request for his accusers to come forward. Carter answered the call, and this time prosecutors brought charges, filing indictments in her case as well as for the alleged abuse of three others.
“I put a lot of hope into them, that I would see justice one day, and it was so important to me that I did,” Carter said.

That hope was lost Tuesday when prosecutors formally dropped all charges against Kelly. Foxx made the announcement at a news conference Monday, saying the office chose to devote its limited resources to other sexual abuse cases, given that Kelly is already facing decades in prison on federal convictions.
Carter said she was devastated.
“My case matters,” Carter said in a lengthy interview Monday evening at her attorneys’ office in downtown Chicago. “When they told me that I didn’t have a case in 2003, I said OK, and I tried to keep on going. Now I come forward again, after you call me to come forward. And now you’re saying it again.”
Kelly has repeatedly denied accusations of wrongdoing against Carter and the other women in the Cook County cases.
Jennifer Bonjean, one of Kelly’s attorneys, said Tuesday that she understands Carter’s concerns, but “I don’t know that taking the stand and being subject to cross-examination is how you’re going to get relief from whatever pain you’re experiencing, I don’t understand it.”
“If she wants justice for Mr. Kelly, he’s in prison. He’s been sentenced to 30 years,” Bonjean said.
Foxx, at her news conference, was careful to note that dropping charges does not mean prosecutors disbelieve any of the allegations.
Kelly was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison on a federal racketeering case in New York. He faces at least 10 years at sentencing Feb. 23 in Chicago’s federal courthouse on charges related to child pornography and sexual misconduct with minors.

But that reality is cold comfort for Carter, who said Foxx’s decision brought up a swirl of emotions.
“I’ve still got to be positive. But I can’t help but say, this is some bull, this is terrible for me,” she said. “I’m upset. But I still have to find the silver lining and I’ve still got to heal. At the end of the day, I’ve got to be able to walk away. But you know, it did not feel good.”
‘I pleaded with them’
Carter first got word back in November that the cases would be dismissed. It was during a meeting with prosecutors, she said, including Foxx herself.
“I pleaded with them. I pleaded with them,” Carter said. In response, she said, prosecutors said they would consider her request and let her know. Carter’s attorneys soon afterward sent the lead assistant state’s attorney on the case a long letter asking them to keep the case alive.
But last week, on a video call with prosecutors, Carter knew before anyone said a word that it would be bad news for her. She saw the attorneys’ pursed lips, the folded hands. And this time, Foxx wasn’t on the call, Carter said.
“When I didn’t see her on the Zoom, I already knew in my heart what the day was,” she said. “I just kept telling myself, ‘I’m not about to cry. I’m not about to cry. I’m tired of crying.’ And then I just — I think I just broke down … it’s like being heartbroken twice by the same person.”

Carter said prosecutors gave her an explanation similar to those Foxx gave at Monday’s news conference: They believe her allegations, but given the near-certainty Kelly will spend decades in prison, they are choosing to spend their resources on other cases.
Carter did not find them persuasive, she said. Kelly’s federal sentence isn’t much comfort when convictions can be overturned and appeals granted. And her case should matter just as much as those of other victims, she said.
“If you believe me, then you fight for me. If you believe me, you advocate for me,” she said. “If it’s about resources, then what about the resources wasted because you didn’t bring it forward?”
‘I thought that I didn’t matter in the world’
Carter first met R. Kelly during a time when, in her own words, she didn’t have much going for her. She’d had her first baby as a teenager and didn’t have much education. But, she said, she could really do hair.
After a member of Kelly’s entourage introduced her to the singer, Carter started doing his hair regularly, and it turned her life around, she said. She hadn’t even been a fan of his music — she preferred rap to R&B — but once she started working with him, people treated her differently. Her whole outlook changed.
“It was like my life had started again,” Carter said. “Like, wow, like the sun looks brighter.”

When Kelly was charged with child pornography in 2002 — a case he was eventually acquitted of — Carter defended him to friends and bystanders who called him guilty and asked her pastors to pray for him.
“I talked to him, and he said everybody (was) lying on him,” she said. “And I legit believed him. He was real charismatic … I guess you just never really should put your guard down.”
Kelly was out on bond for the child pornography charges in 2003 when, prosecutors alleged, 24-year-old Carter came to braid his hair. He greeted her with his pants down and tried to force oral sex on her, prosecutors said.
“He spit on me, he ejaculated in my face,” Carter told the Tribune. “And I left there, and I went to the police. And from then on, it was just a problem after a problem after a problem.”
Carter says she cooperated with police the whole way through. She took a lie detector test, testified before a grand jury. She handed over a shirt that prosecutors would allege, years later, had Kelly’s DNA on it. But at the time, nobody brought charges.
“I never got the questions answered on why nobody took the case forward,” she said.

The lack of answers haunted her. Maybe they didn’t take her seriously because her teeth weren’t fixed, she thought, or her dress was too tight. Maybe it was because she was Black, she thought, or because he was rich and she was living in subsidized housing.
When it became clear her case wouldn’t move forward, she said, people started to encourage her to take whatever money she could, and she listened. Carter reportedly received six-figure settlements from Kelly in the years after her 2003 allegations.
Still, for all those years after the charges were rejected, she said, “I thought that I didn’t matter in the world.”
‘Speak your truth’
That changed in 2019, after Foxx made a public plea for Kelly’s accusers to come forward in the wake of the hit documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.” (Carter, as well as Foxx, later would make appearances in sequels to the documentary.)
Carter didn’t think prosecutors would bring charges in her case. But maybe if she told them her story, she said, it could show a pattern and support other accusers. So she made the call.
A month later, she heard back from the prosecutor’s office and let them know about the shirt and other evidence from her case that emerged back in 2003. They unearthed it from wherever it had been sitting for nearly two decades.

“They just kept saying, ‘We’re sorry, we’re going to make this right,’” Carter said. “I started crying, I started crying so hard.”
Since then, she said, she has taken pains not to do anything that would derail the case. She worked multiple jobs so she couldn’t be accused at trial of airing accusations to try to get rich, she said. And she prepared herself to take the witness stand.
“It kind of made things go full circle like, man, I’m a nurse now. I’m stronger now,” Carter said. “It was like maybe God was planning all this — maybe like this all means something now. And I had put my hopes into that.”
Carter said that while she “didn’t plan on being disappointed twice,” she’s since gotten counseling and has tried to focus on forgiveness and self-care. She’s still grateful that she came forward, and feels firmly that survivors of sexual violence shouldn’t be hesitant to go to authorities.
“Speak your truth. Don’t hide it, go to the police right away,” she said. “And hopefully justice looks different for them, because (Foxx) says she had resources for them now that she’s not going to use on my case.”

Cook County prosecutors dismiss all charges against R. Kelly,"Cook County prosecutors formally dismissed all charges against imprisoned R&B star R. Kelly on Tuesday, marking a subdued end to indictments that made international headlines when they were announced four years ago.
State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced the office’s intention to drop the cases at a news conference Monday. While they believe the allegations against Kelly to be credible, she said, the singer is already facing decades in prison on separate federal convictions and her office has chosen to spend its limited resources on other matters.

During a brief hearing before Judge Lawrence Flood, prosecutors moved to nolle prosequi, or dismiss, the four indictments alleging Kelly committed sexual abuse and assault.
The four Cook County cases were announced in 2019 after Foxx made an unusual public plea for Kelly’s accusers to come forward, saying their cooperation is necessary to bring Kelly to justice.

But those indictments were soon outshined by bombshell charges from federal prosecutors in New York and Chicago. The county cases took a back seat for years while Kelly was convicted in one federal courtroom, then the other.
Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison for racketeering in the New York case. He is scheduled to be sentenced in Chicago next month on convictions related to child pornography and sexual misconduct with minors.
The federal convictions forced Cook County prosecutors into a tough calculation. If they brought him to trial and won, it would have little concrete effect on Kelly, who is expected to spend decades in federal custody no matter what they do. If they lost, it would prove embarrassing for the office that announced charges earliest and with great gusto.
Either route would have cost significant time and resources, and potentially require victims to relive traumatic moments on a very public witness stand.
Foxx said Monday that the office had consulted with the women at the center of the indictments before dropping charges, and reactions were mixed. Some were connected to the other cases and were satisfied with the ultimate outcome, given they had already endured the stress of the federal trials, Foxx said.
Foxx said Kelly’s accusers “are to be commended for their bravery and their relentless pursuit of justice no matter how long it took.”
One Kelly accuser, Lanita Carter, told the Tribune she was devastated when she heard the news.
“If you believe me, then you fight for me. If you believe me, you advocate for me,” she said.

One of the Cook County cases centered on Jerhonda Pace, who was a key witness against Kelly at his New York federal trial last year. Another focused on videos of Kelly abusing his then-teenage goddaughter, which jurors in Kelly’s Chicago federal trial viewed over the summer. Kelly’s defense had previously indicated it would attempt to have a judge throw out those cases on the grounds they were similar to the conduct for which he was convicted federally.
A third Cook County case centered on a woman identified as H.W., who accused Kelly of having sexual contact with her when she was just 16. A fourth indictment centered on Carter’s accusations.

Einst war der 56-Jährige ein gefeierter Musiker. Mit Songs wie ""I Believe I Can Fly"" erlangte er Weltruhm. Seine Macht nutzte der Musiker, um Mädchen und junge Frauen zu missbrauchen. Oft trauten sich seine Opfer deswegen nicht, den berühmten Sänger anzuzeigen.
Auch wenn noch nicht alle Betroffenen im Zeugenstand aussagen konnten, wurden die Anklagen nun fallen gelassen. Denn Kelly drohen bereits mindestens 40 Jahre Haft.
Des Weiteren kann der Musiker frühestens in Berufung gehen, wenn er bereits jenseits der 80 Jahre alt ist. Die Staatsanwaltschaft ist deshalb der Auffassung, dass der Gerechtigkeit Genüge getan wurde.
""Wir haben eine beträchtliche Anzahl von Fällen und Überlebenden, die gleichermaßen die Ressourcen benötigen, die für die Fälle von Herrn Kelly aufgewendet wurden"", erklärt die Staatsanwältin Kourtney Foxx die Entscheidung in einer Presseveranstaltung.
Foxx betonte, dass die Entscheidung in Absprache mit den Opfern von R. Kelly getroffen wurde. Sie und ihr Team beschäftigen sich mit zahlreichen Missbrauchsfällen. Über die meisten wird jedoch nie berichtet.",2023-01-31T15:20:00Z,https://www.tag24.de,TAG24

R. Kelly is set to have charges accusing him of sexually abusing four people, three of whom were minors, dropped by Chicago prosecutors. A judge will decide on the indictments January 31 after multiple federal convictions ensure the singer will remain behind bars for decades. “Mr. Kelly is potentially looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again for the crimes that he’s committed,” Cook County state’s attorney Kim Foxx said, per AP News, referring to federal convictions that found him guilty of sex crimes and child pornography. “While today’s cases are no longer being pursued, we believe justice has been served.” Foxx acknowledged that his accusers might find the decision to dismiss the indictments “disappointing.” Lanita Carter, who accused Kelly sexually assaulted her in February 2003, was “extremely disappointed” with the news. “I have spent nearly 20 years hoping that my abuser would be brought to justice for what he did to me,” Carter said. “With today’s announcement, all hope of justice for my case is gone.” Kelly was indicted in Cook County in 2019 after Foxx pleaded with survivors to come forward.

With today’s announcement, all hope of justice for my case is gone,” Carter said, adding that she trusted Foxx and her office with her story and has spent four years steeling herself to face Kelly to no avail.
“Justice has been denied for me,” she said.
Prosecutors sometimes choose to go ahead with more trials out of a concern that convictions elsewhere could be reversed during appeals. They see an opportunity for additional convictions as insurance.
“We didn’t do a monetary cost-benefit analysis,” Foxx said, adding, however, that resources spent on a trial now could instead be used “in advocacy for other survivors of sexual abuse.”
Another sexual-misconduct case is pending in Hennepin County, Minnesota, where the Grammy Award-winner faces solicitation charges. That case, too, has been on hold while the federal cases played out. Minnesota prosecutors haven’t said whether they still intend to take Kelly to trial.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He beat child pornography charges in Chicago in 2008, when a jury acquitted him.

Prosecutor drops sex abuse charges against singer R Kelly after federal convictions,"A CHICAGO PROSECUTOR is dropping sex abuse charges against singer R Kelly, following federal convictions in two US courts that ensure the disgraced R&B star will be locked up for decades.
Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced the decision on Monday, a day ahead of a court hearing related to state charges accusing him of sexually abusing four people, three of whom were minors.
Foxx said she would ask a judge to dismiss the charges at Tuesday’s hearing.
She acknowledged that the decision “may be disappointing” to women who stepped forward to accuse Kelly of crimes.
“Mr Kelly is looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again … We believe justice has been served,” Foxx said.
Since Kelly was indicted in Cook County in 2019, juries in Chicago and New York have convicted him of a raft of crimes, including child pornography, enticement, racketeering and sex trafficking related to allegations that he victimised women and girls.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is serving a 30-year prison sentence in the New York case and awaits sentencing on 23 February, in Chicago federal court.
He is appealing against those convictions.
Based on the New York sentence alone, the 56-year-old will not be eligible for release until he is around 80.
Additional charges

R. Kelly's Illinois charges to be dropped due to 'extensive sentences' in federal cases,"The state of Illinois is set to drop its Cook County charges against disgraced singer R. Kelly.
Cook County’s state attorney Kim Foxx said the “extensive sentences” the fallen “I Believe I Can Fly” singer is already serving at a federal level in New York meant that “justice has been served.”
Foxx told reporters Monday that she couldn’t justify spending the time and resources to go to trial now that Kelly has been convicted twice on federal charges following his lengthy prison sentence on federal charges of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York last year.
“Sometimes justice is served even when there is no conviction,” Foxx said.
The Grammy-winning singer was sentenced to 30 years behind bars in 2022 for sexually abusing women and underage girls and boys over the course of decades.
Based on the New York sentence alone, Kelly won’t be eligible for release until he is in his 80s.

Kelly, 56, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was convicted on nine charges, including racketeering and violating the Mann Act, which bars interstate transportation of women and girls for “immoral purposes.”
Parallel to his charges in New York, the singer was also found guilty by a federal jury in a separate trial in Chicago on six child pornography and trafficking charges. He is set to be sentenced on February 23.
The sentencing may result in Kelly “never walking out of prison again,” as Foxx noted.
As a result, Foxx said the Cook County State office would not “expend our limited resources and court time with the indictments that we previously charged [against] Mr. Kelly.”

The singer faced charges including 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, relating to allegations made by four women in Cook County. Three of the women were underage at the time of the alleged crimes.
“We have a significant number of cases and survivors who are equally in need of the resources that have been expended on Mr. Kelly’s cases,” Foxx said, adding that the limited resources they have should be used for similar cases state-wide.
“[The decision] is not an indication that we don’t see them,” Foxx said of Kelly’s accusers. “I want to acknowledge that when we brought these charges… we brought them because we believed the allegations to be credible and we believed that they deserved the opportunity to have the allegations heard.”
Foxx said she consulted with Kelly’s accusers before making the announcement.
“For them, the process of going through this process was very difficult, and they are pleased with the outcome of the sentence and judgment against Mr. Kelly,” Foxx added.
Kelly is also facing state-level charges in Minnesota after being accused of soliciting a minor for sexual purposes and engaging in prostitution with a minor.

Illinois Drops Sex-Abuse Charges Against R. Kelly Because Of Previous Conviction,"Topline
An Illinois prosecutor will drop state sex-abuse charges against former R&B singer R. Kelly, according to an announcement by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, because a federal court has already sentenced him to 30 years in prison on sex trafficking charges.

Key Facts
Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced Tuesday her office will drop counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and aggravated sexual abuse charges against R. Kelly involving four victims, including three minors. Foxx cited a June 2022 sentencing against the former R&B singer—born Robert Sylvester Kelly—that will put him behind bars for 30 years, along with a future sentencing from child pornography and child enticement conviction in September, as the reason for dropping the charges. Lanita Carter, who alleges Kelly sexually abused her in 2003, told the Associated Press she was “extremely disappointed” by the decision, adding “all hope of justice for my case is gone.”
What To Watch For
Kelly still faces prostitution and solicitation charges in a Hennepin County, Minnesota, court after allegedly inviting a 17-year-old girl to his hotel room in 2001. Prosecutors have not said whether they intend to take Kelly to trial.
Key Background
Kelly, known for his songs “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Ignition,” has been surrounded by allegations of abuse since the 1990s after his illegal marriage to the late R&B singer Aaliyah, who was just 15 when she wed Kelly. Though there was much speculation about Kelly, a 2017 series from Buzzfeed News and a 2019 documentary series Surviving R. Kelly acted as a catalyst for legal action against the singer. Though he was first indicted on child pornography charges in 2002, he was acquitted in 2008. Kelly was charged separately in 2019 in Chicago and in 2020 in New York under federal charges for sex trafficking and other sex-abuse-related crimes, pleading not guilty to all charges. During the New York trial—which resulted in his 30-year imprisonment—prosecutors described Kelly as a “predator” who used his influence to lure women into sex with him. Witnesses said they had sex with Kelly while they were underage, and described him as controlling.

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said her office dropped the charges against R. Kelly in Chicago, Illinois, because ""justice has been served"" in federal convictions.
""I understand how hard it was for these victims to come forward and tell their stories. I applaud their courage and have the utmost respect for everyone who came forward,"" Foxx said in a press release. ""While this may not be the result they were expecting, due to the sentences that Mr. Kelly is facing, we do feel that justice has been served.""
Foxx initially brought charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse and assault against Kelly in 2019, following the release of the documentary Surviving R. Kelly.
""My office will direct our resources to find justice for other victims of sexual abuse who do not have the power of a documentary to bring their abusers to light,"" Foxx said.
During a press conference recording by WLS Foxx said that one survivor is disappointed that ""she would not have her day in court. Some of our survivors, some of those who have been named in our petitions, have had justice in courtrooms that are not here.""
In September 2021, Kelly was found guilty of racketeering and sex-trafficking charges in New York stemming from decades-long allegations of sexual abuse of women and girls. In June 2022, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In August 2022, Illinois federal court also found Kelly guilty of three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement, Insider previously reported. Those charges could add decades to his sentence.
""Due to the extensive sentences that these convictions hold, our office has decided not to continue to expend our limited resources and court time with the indictments that we previously charged Mr. Kelly,"" Foxx said, during the press conference.

Chicago klaagt R. Kelly niet langer aan om al ‘uitgebreide straf’,"In de Amerikaanse staat Illinois zijn aanklachten om seksueel misbruik tegen de al veroordeelde zanger R. Kelly komen te vervallen. Openbaar aanklager Kim Foxx vertelde maandag aan Amerikaanse media dat ""recht heeft geschied"" door twee eerdere veroordelingen op federaal niveau en daarom besloten is tien lokale aanklachten tegen de zanger te laten vallen.
R. Kelly, een van de meest prominente Amerikanen die veroordeeld is na de opkomst van #MeToo, zit momenteel een celstraf van 30 jaar uit nadat hij vorig jaar in New York werd veroordeeld in een misbruikzaak. Vorig najaar oordeelde een jury in Chicago bovendien dat hij ook daar schuldig is aan seksuele misdrijven en in die federale zaak doet een rechter eind februari uitspraak. Kelly, die eigenlijk Robert Sylvester Kelly heet, riskeert in de zaak nog eens 10 tot 90 jaar gevangenisstraf.
De lokale zaak die in Chicago nu van tafel is, begon in 2019 met een oproep van Foxx. Zij vroeg slachtoffers naar voren te komen. Vier zwarte vrouwen, van wie drie tijdens het vermeende delict minderjarig, deden hun verhaal, schrijft The Los Angeles Times. Foxx erkent dat de beslissing om de zaken nu alsnog te laten vallen voor deze slachtoffers ""misschien teleurstellend"" kan zijn. Toch is hiertoe besloten, vanwege de ""uitgebreide straf"" die Kelly sowieso al uit moet zitten en de ""beperkte middelen en tijd"" van het kantoor van de aanklager.
Foxx bedankte maandag in een persconferentie de slachtoffers die naar voren waren gekomen en prees hun ""moed en streven naar gerechtigheid, ongeacht hoe lang het duurde"". Zij zei wel dat hun verklaringen in beperkte mate ook hadden geholpen bij de federale zaak die in Chicago tegen Kelly dient.

Darum gehts Seine Strafe im US-Bundesstaat New York sitzt R. Kelly bereits ab. Aus Chicago sollen keine weiteren Jahre hinter Gittern hinzukommen.
Dies schlägt die dortige Staatsanwältin vor.
Der Sänger würde das Gefängnis vermutlich nie mehr verlassen, so die Begründung.
Der Musiker R. Kelly wurde letztes Jahr in New York zu 30 Jahren hinter Gittern verurteilt.
Nebst sexueller Ausbeutung von Minderjährigen wurde dem Popstar auch Kidnapping vorgeworfen.
Eine Staatsanwältin in Chicago will Vorwürfe des sexuellen Missbrauchs gegen den früheren Popstar R. Kelly fallen lassen. Staatsanwältin Kim Foxx gab die Entscheidung am Montag bekannt, einen Tag vor einer Gerichtsanhörung im Zusammenhang mit Vorwürfen auf Staatsebene in Illinois, der 56-Jährige habe vier Menschen missbraucht, drei davon in minderjährigem Alter.
Foxx erklärte, dass sie das Gericht bei der Anhörung am Dienstag darum bitten werde. Die Entscheidung könne für einige der Frauen «enttäuschend» sein, die mit ihren Vorwürfen vorgetreten seien. Kelly werde das Gefängnis jedoch womöglich nie mehr verlassen. «Wir glauben, dass der Gerechtigkeit Genüge getan wurde», sagte sie.
Der «I Believe I Can Fly»-Sänger ist bereits wegen Sexualverbrechen zu jahrzehntelanger Haft verurteilt worden. Seitdem er im Jahr 2019 in Cook County angeklagt wurde, ist er auf Bundesebene in Chicago und New York einer Reihe von Verbrechen für schuldig befunden worden, darunter etwa Kinderpornografie, Erpressung und Sexhandel im Zusammenhang mit Vorwürfen, sich an Frauen und Mädchen vergangen zu haben.
Erst mit #MeToo kam der Fall
Eine 30-jährige Haftstrafe, zu der er in New York verurteilt wurde, sitzt er bereits ab. Das Gericht in Chicago wird voraussichtlich am 23. Februar das Strafmass verkünden. Ein weiterer Fall ist im US-Staat Minnesota anhängig. Die zuständige Staatsanwaltschaft hat sich noch nicht dazu geäussert, ob es auch dort zum Prozess kommen soll. Das Verfahren lag während der Verhandlungen auf Bundesebene auf Eis.
Vorwürfe über unangemessene Beziehungen Kellys kursierten seit Jahrzehnten, doch wurden sie von Medien und Öffentlichkeit lange eher amüsiert zur Kenntnis genommen, angefangen mit Kellys illegaler Heirat mit R&B-Sängerin Aaliyah im Jahr 1994, als sie gerade 15 Jahre alt war. Dennoch feierte er Megaerfolge, seine Musikalben und die Eintrittskarten für seine Konzerte verkauften sich weiterhin blendend.
Selbst als er 2002 unter dem Vorwurf festgenommen wurde, sich beim Missbrauch einer 14-Jährigen gefilmt zu haben, spielten Kollegen immer noch seine Songs ein. Im Jahr 2008 wurde er in einem Prozess wegen Verbreitung von Kinderpornografie in Chicago von der Jury noch freigesprochen. Erst die im Zusammenhang mit den Missbrauchsvorwürfen der #MeToo-Bewegung veröffentlichte Dokumentation «Surviving R. Kelly» brachte ihn öffentlich in Verruf.

Prosecutors in Chicago Will Drop Abuse Charges Against R. Kelly,"Noting that the R&B singer R. Kelly is facing decades in prison after two federal convictions, the top prosecutor in Chicago said on Monday that her office planned to drop its sexual abuse charges against him.
The Cook County state’s attorney’s office had been waiting for its turn to bring Mr. Kelly, 56, to trial, which it could not do before the federal court cases in New York and Chicago were brought to a jury.
In 2021, Mr. Kelly was convicted on racketeering and sex trafficking charges, for which he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Last year, he was convicted on sex crimes charges, including coercing minors into sexual activity and producing sex tapes involving a minor. He is scheduled to be sentenced for that conviction next month, which could add decades to the total.
“Mr. Kelly is potentially looking at never walking out of prison again for the crimes he’s committed,” Kim Foxx, the Cook County state’s attorney, said at a news conference in which she announced plans to drop the charges. “We believe that justice has been served.”",2023-01-31T01:13:00Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
R. Kelly Sexual Abuse Charges Dropped in Illinois,"All state-level charges filed against R. Kelly in Cook County, Illinois, have been dropped, state attorney Kim Foxx announced at a press conference Monday (Jan. 30). Kelly is scheduled to appear in court on the indictments, which include 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, on Tuesday morning.
In making the announcement, Foxx reiterated Kelly’s convictions in federal court in New York and Illinois to explain the prosecutors’ decision. “Due to the extensive sentences that these convictions hold, our office has decided not to continue to expend our limited resources and court time with the indictments that we previously charged Mr. Kelly [with],” she said.

In the New York federal case, Kelly was found guilty in September 2021 on all nine counts, including racketeering and sex trafficking; he was sentenced to 30 years in prison the following June. In September, he was convicted on three counts of child pornography in the Illinois federal case but acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge that stemmed from an accusation that he’d fixed his state child pornography trial in 2008. Though he has not yet been sentenced in that case, he faces between 10 and 90 years in prison, according to Foxx.
Foxx — who previously revealed her own history as a victim of sexual abuse — grew visibly emotional during her time at the podium as she admitted that for the four victims in the state case, the outcome “may be disappointing. But I want to acknowledge that when we brought these charges forward, we brought them because we believed the allegations to be credible. And we believed that they deserved to have the opportunity to have the allegations heard.
“These women, both those who are named in our indictments and the women in New York and in the Northern District of Illinois, are to be commended for their bravery and their relentless pursuit of justice, no matter how long it took,” she continued.
Despite Foxx’s weighty and considered comments Monday, the announcement isn’t particularly surprising in light of Kelly’s dual convictions in federal court. After the disgraced singer was found guilty in the New York case, criminal defense attorney Isabelle A. Kirshner told Billboard that local jurisdictions in Illinois as well as Minnesota — where he still faces state charges — may choose to drop some of all of the charges in order to preserve resources.

Foxx acknowledged the news was likely disappointing to victims.

“Our office has decided not to expend our limited resources and court time with the indictments,” the prosecutor said.
“Mr. Kelly is looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again. ... We believe justice has been served,” Foxx added.
The charges will be formally dismissed during a hearing in Chicago on Tuesday.
Kelly won’t be eligible for release for the New York conviction until he is 80. However, he is appealing both federal convictions.
Foxx originally indicted Kelly in Cook County in February 2019 but the case was put on hold while the federal cases were resolved. Foxx urged victims to come forward after Lifetime aired the documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly.”

Kelly is also facing state charges in Hennepin County, Minn. after he was accused of soliciting a 17-year-old girl. That case was also delayed in favor of the federal cases. Local prosecutors have not said whether that case will proceed to trial.
Kelly was previously acquitted of child pornography charges in Chicago in 2008. In his September 2022 trial, prosecutors unsuccessfully argued Kelly and his then-business manager rigged the earlier proceeding.

R. Kelly Cases: Chicago Prosecutor Drops Sex Abuse Charges In State Case,"A Chicago prosecutor dropped charges of sexual abuse against R. Kelly. According to multiple reports, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said cost was a factor in dropping the ten charges. Moreover, she told reporters that these charges are unnecessary to pursue in the face of his current predicament.

Furthermore, she stated that her office believes “justice has been served against Kelly with those two convictions. Mr. Kelly is looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again.” To continue, authorities scheduled the R&B singer to appear in court on Tuesday to drop the charges. Moreover, he faced charges of sexually abusing four people, of which three were minors.
However, this state case dates back to 2019, when Foxx said the incidents occurred between May of 1998 and January of 2010. Also, the 56-year-old faced three to seven years in prison for each charge.
Okay let’s not do this. Marilyn Manson is a literal abuser. Would we be all okay with someone wearing an R Kelly shirt? No. So why are our communities morality so nonchalant? We should hold ourselves to a higher standard considering the white supremacy problem in groups. https://t.co/nHbGrDuRZI — On the verge of defenestrating myself 24/7 (@extremelygaby78) January 28, 2023
Meanwhile, Foxx revealed that she consulted her decision to drop the charges with the women involved in the indictment. While she believes it might come off as a disappointment to some, she hoped they can understand many factors were at play.
“I know firsthand how difficult it is for you to tell your stories,” she expressed. “Four years ago, I stood at this podium and shared my story of having been a survivor and my full understanding of what it means to have to go before strangers to discuss what is arguably one of the most horrific experiences one could have. And these women, all of them Black, came forward, believing that they would be heard.”
Overall, Kelly’s currently serving a 30-year sentence after a New York conviction for racketeering and sex trafficking. In addition, authorities will sentence him in another federal case in Chicago later this month. What’s more is that this news follows the recent release of Surviving R. Kelly’s final installment.
Still, what do you think of the news that a Chicago prosecutor dropped her office’s charges against R. Kelly? Whatever the case, let us know in the comments down below. Also, as always, come back to HNHH for the latest on this case.

Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is serving a 30-year prison sentence in the New York case and awaits sentencing on 23 February in Chicago federal court. He is appealing those convictions. Based on the New York sentence alone, the 56-year-old won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.

Sex-abuse charges against disgraced R&B musician R Kelly will be dropped by a prosecutor who believes that enough ""justice has been served"".
Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx has announced her decision surrounding state charges accusing him of sexually abusing four people, three of whom were minors.
Despite admitting the decision ""may be disappointing"" to those who have accused the I Believe I Can Fly artist of crimes, the attorney ""believes justice has been served"".
""Mr. Kelly is looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again,"" they said after announcing that the charges would be dropped, reports the Associated Press.

Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June last year, after being convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking.
It was in September of last year that he was also convicted of several child pornography and sex abuse charges in his hometown of Chicago.
The Grammy winner was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement.
At his sentencing Kelly was branded ""the pied piper of R&B"" as he came face to face with several of his victims who detailed his ""deplorable and inexplicable"" abuse, which took place over decades.
The singer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for songs including his first number one single Bump N’ Grind and 1996 hit I Believe I Can Fly.

The latter became an inspirational anthem played at school graduations, weddings, in advertisements and elsewhere, including the inauguration of former US president Barack Obama in 2008.
The latest revelations come after last September's news that R Kelly would be required to pay $309,000 in restitution to one of the victims of his decades-long scheme to use his fame to sexually exploit young aspiring singers and underage children.
A restitution order by US District Judge Ann Connelly, that is still being finalised, is intended to cover the cost of treatment for the victim's herpes and psychotherapy.
The victim, who remains anonymous, has accused the singer of giving her the sexually transmitted disease during one of their encounters.

Kelly could also be made to pay tens of thousands of dollars to a second victim. The judge rejected a claim by a third accuser.
The Grammy-winning songwriter appeared at the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn via video from a lockup in Chicago.
He only spoke to exchange greetings with the judge and to turn down an offer to say more. None of the victims were in attendance.
The question now becomes when and how Kelly will pay the restitution.

Prosecutors claim he has access to as much as $5million to go along with about $28,000 seized from his inmate commissary account that defence attorney Jennifer Bonjean said was made up of donations from fans.
Jennifer told the judge that Kelly has no access to any other funds because of judgments in civil cases brought against him. She also insisted that her client has always been clueless about his finances.",2023-01-30T23:01:30Z,https://www.irishmirror.ie,Irish Mirror

Chicago prosecutor drops sex abuse charges against R. Kelly,"An Illinois prosecutor dropped 10 charges of sex abuse against singer R. Kelly on Monday, saying at a news conference the cost was one of the factors weighed in her decision.
Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is already serving a 30-year prison sentence on charges of federal racketeering and sex- trafficking after being convicted in New York last year. He is also due to be sentenced in a second federal case in Chicago later this month.
Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx told reporters that her office believes ""justice has been served"" against Kelly with those two convictions. She noted her office's ""limited resources and court time"" was the ultimate factor, noting that her office found the accusations to be credible.
""Mr. Kelly is looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again,"" Foxx said.
Kelly is set to appear Tuesday in Cook County Court, where the charges will be formally dropped. The state has accused Kelly of sexually abusing four people, three of whom were minors.
Foxx announced the state's case against Kelly in 2019, saying the incidents occurred between May 1998 and January 2010. Kelly was facing three to seven years in prison for each charge if convicted.
The women in the case were only identified in the indictment by their initials, but multiple women have come forward with allegations against Kelly over the years.
Lifetime aired a six-part docuseries, ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" in January 2019 in which multiple women alleged Kelly subjected them to mental, physical and sexual abuse. Foxx urged potential victims to come forward to speak with her office about possible criminal activity in the aftermath of the series.
Foxx said Monday that she consulted with the women in the indictment before making the choice to drop the charges, acknowledging that some might be disappointed.
""I know firsthand how difficult it is for you to tell your stories,” Foxx said.

Kelly is also facing state charges in Minnesota, where he's been accused of soliciting a minor for sexual purposes and engaging in prostitution with a minor.
In the New York case, Kelly was convicted on nine counts of racketeering and sex trafficking. Jurors found that Kelly had set up a criminal enterprise that enabled him to recruit and transport underage girls for sex.
Months later in Chicago's federal court, he was convicted on six counts of sexual exploitation and enticement of a minor. He is scheduled to be sentenced on those charges on Feb. 23.

R. Kelly Has Sexual Abuse Indictments in Illinois Dropped Due to Due to “Extensive Sentences” for Federal Crimes,"R. Kelly is no longer facing local charges in Cook County, Illinois, a change announced by state attorney Kim Foxx at a press conference today (January 30). Kelly had pleaded not guilty to the ten state-level counts of aggravated sexual abuse in 2019, and is currently awaiting sentencing on separate federal charges after being found guilty of possessing child pornography.
Foxx noted multiple times that Kelly’s 30-year sentence from his Brooklyn trial for racketeering and sex trafficking, plus his pending sentence for the federal charges Chicago, would result in Kelly’s imprisonment for several decades. She stressed that the decision to drop the state level charges came from strategic prioritization and a desire to allocate more resources to other, less publicized sexual assault cases. “We have a significant number of cases and survivors who are equally in need of the resources that have been expended on Mr. Kelly’s cases,” she said.
Noting that all of Kelly’s accusers are Black women, Foxx acknowledged that Kelly’s alleged victims might be disappointed by the outcome, but that the decision is “not an indication that we don’t see them.” She further commended the women who had testified against Kelly amid other federal trials in Brooklyn and Chicago, and said that the dropped charges did not indicate that survivors’ cases were insufficient. “While today’s cases are no longer being pursued, we believe that justice has been served,” Foxx said.
Kelly is currently incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago following his September conviction. He’s still facing additional state-level charges for engaging in prostitution with a minor in Minnesota.

A Chicago prosecutor said Monday that she’s dropping sex-abuse charges against singer R. Kelly following federal convictions in two courts that should guarantee the disgraced R&B star will be locked up for decades.
Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced the decision a day ahead of a hearing related to state charges accusing him of sexually abusing four people, three of whom were minors. She said she would ask a judge to dismiss the indictments Tuesday.
Foxx, who in 2019 had pleaded with women and girls to come forward so she could pursue charges against Kelly, acknowledged that the decision “may be disappointing” to his accusers.
“Mr. Kelly is potentially looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again for the crimes that he’s committed,” the prosecutor said, referring to his federal convictions. “While today’s cases are no longer being pursued, we believe justice has been served.”
Since Kelly was indicted in Cook County in 2019, federal juries in Chicago and New York have convicted him of a raft of crimes, including child pornography, enticement, racketeering and sex trafficking related to allegations that he victimized women and girls.

Foxx said she reached out to Kelly’s lawyer two weeks ago to indicate that charges might be dropped. She also spoke to the women whose allegations were at the heart of the case.
Foxx expressed praise for the “courage it took for them to come forward.”
Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said she was “pleased” with the prosecution’s decision to drop charges.
“He only has one life to give. So I don’t know how many sentences upon sentences would satisfy people,” Bonjean said.
Lanita Carter, who said she was sexually assaulted by R. Kelly in February 2003, said she was “extremely disappointed” with the news.
“I have spent nearly 20 years hoping that my abuser would be brought to justice for what he did to me. With today’s announcement, all hope of justice for my case is gone,” Carter said, adding that she trusted Foxx and her office with her story and has spent four years steeling herself to face Kelly to no avail.
“Justice has been denied for me,” she said.
Prosecutors sometimes choose to go ahead with more trials out of a concern that convictions elsewhere could be reversed during appeals. They see an opportunity for additional convictions as insurance.
“We didn’t do a monetary cost-benefit analysis,” Foxx said, adding, however, that resources spent on a trial now could instead be used “in advocacy for other survivors of sexual abuse.”

CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago prosecutor said Monday that she’s dropping sex-abuse charges against singer R. Kelly following federal convictions in two courts that should guarantee the disgraced R&B star will be locked up for decades.
Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx announced the decision a day ahead of a hearing related to state charges accusing him of sexually abusing four people, three of whom were minors. She said she would ask a judge to dismiss the indictments Tuesday.
Foxx, who in 2019 had pleaded with women and girls to come forward so she could pursue charges against Kelly, acknowledged that the decision “may be disappointing” to his accusers.
“Mr. Kelly is potentially looking at the possibility of never walking out of prison again for the crimes that he’s committed,” the prosecutor said, referring to his federal convictions. “While today’s cases are no longer being pursued, we believe justice has been served.”

Chicago Prosecutor Drops Sex Abuse Charges Against R. Kelly,"The Cook County State's Attorney's office dropped 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against singer R. Kelly Monday, citing the R&B star's previous convictions, high cost of prosecution and limited resources.
At a news conference, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx explained her office is no longer pursuing four sex abuse indictments against Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison last year after being found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking following a trial in New York.
""While today's cases are no longer being pursued, we believe that justice has been served in the sentences that have already been handed down to Mr. Kelly, as well as the sentence that will come down next month,"" the state's attorney said. ""...I want to make unequivocally clear that we take allegations of sexual abuse and sexual assault seriously...""
Foxx in 2019 charged Kelly with with aggravated sexual abuse involving four victims, including at least three between the ages of 13 and 17. At the time, she said the abuse dated back as far as 1998 and spanned more than a decade.

A federal trial in Chicago ended on Sept. 14 with his conviction on charges of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex. Weeks later, a federal judge signaled that she planned to order the disgraced R&B superstar to pay more than $300,000 to one his victims in a decades-long scheme to use his fame to sexually abuse young fans.
A restitution order by U.S. District Judge Ann Connelly that was still being finalized in September was meant to cover the cost of treatment for herpes and psychotherapy. The victim, referred to only by a pseudonym, accused the jailed Kelly of giving her the sexually transmitted disease during one of their encounters.
Kelly could be on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars more to pay for herpes treatment and counseling for a second victim once the final tally is calculated. The judge rejected a third claim by another accuser.
While federal prosecutors in Chicago scored multiple convictions against Kelly at the singer’s trial in September, they lost on the headline charge — that Kelly obstructed justice by rigging his 2008 state child pornography trial, at which jurors acquitted him.
After the verdict, U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed disappointment in not winning convictions across the board. But he said Kelly was still looking at a prison sentence of 10 to 90 years. He said he was pleased Kelly was “finally being held accountable.” Sentencing is set for Feb. 23.
At least one legal expert said obstruction of justice charges aren’t generally hard to prove. “But in this case,” said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, “the facts just weren’t there.”
Jurors also acquitted Kelly of receiving child pornography and one count of producing child pornography. He was convicted of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex. His attorney planned to appeal, but it's unclear if an appeal has been filed.",2023-01-30T16:58:27Z,https://www.nbcboston.com,NBC10 Boston
Fate of R. Kelly’s Cook County indictments could finally be learned after months of inaction,"The fate of the four Cook County sex-abuse indictments against imprisoned R&B star R. Kelly could be learned Monday after months of inaction in court has led to rumors that the cases will be dropped.
State’s Attorney Kim Foxx is expected to provide an update on the status of the cases at a news conference at 3:30 p.m. at the Cook County Administration Building, the same place where she announced the charges against Kelly nearly four years ago.

Rumors have been swirling for weeks that the cases were going to be dropped, particularly after a series of status hearings before Associate Judge Lawrence Flood. came and went with no progress toward trial.
Kelly’s cases are scheduled for another status hearing before Flood on Tuesday morning at the Leighton Criminal Court Building.
Advertisement
A spokeswoman for Foxx could not provide further details Monday morning, and Kelly’s attorney, Steven Greenberg, had no immediate comment.
Kelly, 56, remains in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in the Loop.
The county cases, all of which accused Kelly of sexual abuse or assault, were filed against the singer in February 2019, shortly after the airing of the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” that resurrected interest in sexual misconduct allegations against Kelly going back decades.
But the once-explosive indictments announced by Foxx soon took a back seat to a pair of federal investigations by U.S. Attorney’s offices in New York and Chicago that led to separate indictments announced in July 2019.
Kelly was convicted in New York of racketeering conspiracy and sentenced in June to a whopping 30 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 23 at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago on convictions last September related to child pornography and sexual misconduct with minors.
The federal convictions have forced Cook County prosecutors into a tough calculation. If they bring him to trial and win, it would have little concrete effect on Kelly, who is expected to spend decades in federal custody no matter what they do. If they lost, it would prove highly embarrassing for the office that announced charges earliest and with great gusto.
Either route would have cost significant time and resources, and potentially require victims to relive traumatic moments on a very public witness stand.
One of the Cook County cases centered on Jerhonda Pace, who was a key witness against Kelly at his New York federal trial last year. Another focused on videos of Kelly abusing his then-teenage goddaughter, which jurors in Kelly’s Chicago federal trial viewed over the summer. Kelly’s defense had previously indicated it would attempt to have a judge throw out those cases on the grounds they were similar to the conduct for which he was convicted federally.

A third Cook County case centered on a woman identified as H.W., who accused Kelly of having sexual contact with her when she was just 16. A fourth indictment involved an adult accuser, L.C., who said Kelly sexually abused her in 2003 when she came to braid his hair.

Judge rejects effort to make feds pay legal bills for R. Kelly’s ex-manager,"A federal judge on Monday shot down an unusual effort by the attorney for R. Kelly’s former business manager Derrel McDavid to force the government to pay McDavid’s nearly $1 million legal tab.
The long-shot motion filed in October by attorney Beau Brindley alleged the evidence against McDavid, who was acquitted of all counts by a jury, was “irreconcilably conflicted and incoherent,” and that he deserves payment after successfully defending himself against a “capricious and overzealous prosecution.”
Advertisement
McDavid incurred $850,000 in legal fees and was left to try to liquidate real estate and other assets in an attempt to pay them off, Brindley stated at the time.
Prosecutors defended bringing their case despite the jury’s findings, writing in response that McDavid “stood by Robert Kelly’s side for decades while Kelly sexually abused young girls and manufactured child pornography.”
Advertisement
In his four-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber wrote that the prosecutors had probable cause to bring the charges against McDavid and the allegations were “not vexatious, frivolous or in bad faith,” which is the legal standard for ordering that a defendant’s legal bills be paid by the government.
“The jury assessed the testimony, evidence and credibility of the witnesses, and reached a conclusion on those grounds,” Leinenweber wrote. “McDavid argues that the government’s case was logically impossible, but the court disagreed in trial, and it disagrees now.”
A jury of seven women and five men acquitted McDavid, 61, of all counts alleging he conspired with Kelly and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, to buy back incriminating videotapes of the singer sexually abusing underage girls and rig his 2008 child pornography trial in Cook County. Brown was also acquitted of the single count against him.
The verdict was split, however, as the jury convicted Kelly on child pornography charges for making three videotapes of himself sexually abusing his then-14-year-old goddaughter beginning in the late 1990s, as well as sexual misconduct with two other minors around the same time period. His sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 23.
McDavid was paid millions as Kelly’s longtime associate, according to trial testimony. He is a professional accountant who also managed other celebrities, and co-owns the popular River North restaurant Mercadito.

Little progress in R. Kelly cases as defense requests more information on charges,"A courtroom sketch shows defense attorneys Ashley Cohen, from left, and Jennifer Bonjean with singer R. Kelly at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago on Sept. 14, 2022. (Cheryl Cook / Chicago Tribune)
R. Kelly’s Cook County cases continue to move at a snail’s pace, despite a judge’s past urging to make progress now that the singer’s two federal trials have concluded.
Kelly’s defense this week filed additional motions saying they could not proceed until prosecutors reveal more specific information about their allegations against Kelly. And prosecutors just turned over “significant” potential evidence to the defense last week, one motion alleges.

The disgraced R&B superstar was supposed to attend county court Wednesday for an afternoon hearing, at which attorneys were slated to argue on the defense’s request to dismiss some of his charges.
Instead, the hearing was quietly rescheduled for Wednesday morning, no arguments were made, and Kelly stayed in federal lockup. It has been almost a year since Kelly’s attorneys first filed the request that was supposed to be discussed this week.
Advertisement
The hearing Wednesday lasted about one minute. Prosecutors said they had received the defense motions and wanted more time to respond. Kelly’s next court date was scheduled for the end of the month.
When Associate Judge Lawrence Flood asked Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean whether she wanted the singer present, Bonjean said no, since “he does not want to be here.”
The new court filings from Bonjean allege that prosecutors have not given the defense enough information about the charges related to “J.P” — known to be Jerhonda Pace — who accuses Kelly of having sexual contact with her when she was underage. Pace was a central witness in Kelly’s New York federal trial.
It is unclear, the defense says, how many separate sexual encounters county prosecutors allege Kelly had with the teenage Pace, and they do not have enough information about the specific dates and locations of the alleged acts.
“Even if the Complainant cannot recall precise dates during the relevant time period, she should be able to identify a location of the occurrence or occurrences,” one motion states.
The defense also asked Flood to make prosecutors reveal whether they intend to introduce “prior bad acts” evidence against Kelly, that is, accusations of past behavior that are not part of the formal charges.
It has been about a year since another of Kelly’s attorneys, Steve Greenberg, filed a formal request to throw out the county case related to Pace. Greenberg said in court months ago that he intends to file a similar request on one of the other cases, presumably the indictment centering on some of the same video footage at issue in the Chicago federal case.
Flood in recent months has repeatedly said from the bench he wants to see progress in those cases, but little has happened, with no apparent consequences for the attorneys involved.

The four separate Cook County indictments allege Kelly sexually abused or assaulted four people, three of whom were underage girls at the time.
All those cases have largely stagnated since federal prosecutors in two states filed double-whammy indictments against the singer in the summer of 2019. The county cases were quickly overshadowed, and Kelly has since been convicted of federal sex crime-related charges in both Chicago and New York.
Kelly was convicted in Chicago federal court in September on charges including child pornography related to his years of sexual abuse of his underage goddaughter and other girls. He was acquitted, however, of the explosive allegations that he rigged his initial Cook County trial in the 2000s.
His sentencing in Chicago federal court is scheduled for next month.
Kelly has already been sentenced to 30 years after a jury in New York found him guilty of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging his musical career doubled as a criminal enterprise aimed at satisfying his predatory sexual desires.

"‘Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter’- Protect Black Women, And Girls With The Same Energy We Protect The Accused","I wanted to write this story from a distance. However, my unwanted experience with a man as an 11-year-old played vividly as I watched Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter, which premiered on Lifetime on Jan. 2 and 3. Bearing witness to new, even more horrifying details that emerged on the record at his trial made it impossible. For example, Jane Doe testified at R. Kelly’s New York trial that she was forced to eat and smear feces on her face and pretend to enjoy it. This detail survivor Jerhonda Pace corroborated, telling viewers, “Once you reached a first anniversary, that’s what you do. Eat his feces and drink his urine.”
In addition, survivor Ebonié Doyle who met Kelly in 1993 as a 16-year-old when Kelly was 26—said in the docuseries things soon turned as he became “really controlling,” even sharing a moment where she says she learned to pick her battles after accidentally uncovering a tape of R.Kelly and Aaliyah. “What I saw on that tape was he and Aaliyah being intimate,” she recalled.
Doyle goes on to share that after Kelly realized she’d watched the tape, an argument was ensured, leading to her being pushed down a flight of stairs. “That shake sent me down flights of stairs, and I just laid there. I just froze.”
Since the airing of the first installment of Surviving R. Kelly in 2019, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June 2022 by United States District Judge Ann Donnelly following a 2021 conviction on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges. Before issuing the sentence, she briefly addressed Kelly saying, “This case is not about sex. It is about violence, cruelty, and control.” Additionally, Kelly was convicted on three of four counts of production of child pornography and three of five counts of enticement of a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity at a Chicago federal trial.
I can relate to the experiences of R. Kelly’s victims and survivors at length, but I won’t share the details of my experience. However, I am thankful to have listened to my pre-teen intuition that helped me forcefully remove myself from that situation and lock myself in the bathroom until a trusted adult—who I never told— came back into the house.
Nearly 25 years later, that moment still haunts me. It reminds me that many of the predatory actions R. Kelly—who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June 2022—took to prey on minors were happening around me the moment I developed. Their experiences could have been mine. And then there’s the more disturbing realization: this type of abuse is still happening. Carving out this story, I’ve thought deeply about the support I’d want to give my inner child. Additionally, I thought about the horrid details of sexual abuse, degradation, and psychological torment these young women experienced.
I’ve also pondered the hashtags and t-shirts that read #ProtectBlackWomen and the juxtaposition of that very saying as we saw the mistreatment of Megan Thee Stallion unfold for years that continues even after her perpetrator was found guilty.
So, how do we protect Black women IRL? Not via a hashtag or an empty social media post. Because protection, a verb in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, means: to cover or shield from exposure, injury, damage, or destruction. So where’s the shield? To get some insight on protection methods, I spoke with two experts—Stacian Watts, M.Sc., RP, registered psychotherapist and founder of Toronto-based Watts Psychotherapy, and Jennifer M. Gómez, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Clinical Practice department at Boston University School of Social Work—for guidance.
Stop adultifying Black girls.
In social forums, sexual violence becomes debatable. However, the numbers do not lie. The American Psychological Organization reports one in four black girls will be sexually abused before the age of 18. Yet, the same study from the organization found that for every Black woman who reports rape, at least 15 Black women do not. These staggering numbers directly reflect how society treats young Black girls’ experience, silencing us at a very young age that then tips over into adulthood.
“Much of this goes back to Black women being considered the mules of society,” Stacian Watts, M.Sc., RP, tells us. “We’re meant to endure hardship with little to no complaints and are expected to prioritize other people’s needs above our own. So when we speak out against harm done to us, society must see our humanity. People must see Black women and girls in our full humanity and deserving of protection and support.”
So, how do we stop adultification and create space for Black girls to share their experiences openly? First, Watts says we need to understand the developmental capacity of an adolescent regardless of their physical appearance or development. “Black girls are treated much more mature than they developmentally are,” she notes, even though the adolescent age range is from 12 to 25 years old. The last part of our brains to develop, she says, is our prefrontal cortex which is responsible for executive functioning. “Those skills are important for judgment, decision-making, and planning.”
Put the blame where it belongs and believe survivors.
“We support young people who are survivors by placing the responsibility where it belongs—on the adults who victimize them because they can’t consent to a sexual relationship with an adult,” Watts tells ESSENCE. Additionally, she says, “We need to believe young people when they trust us enough to share their experience” because this moment of the disclosure can make or break how survivors deal with and address their trauma. “The research shows that the response and support are given to a person when they disclose trauma and abuse can significantly improve the outcome of their healing and recovery process.”
Remember, Black girls and women, deserve justice, too.
So often, the traumatic experiences of Black girls and women are forgotten, especially when the accused is a wealthy, famous Black man because of the history of systemic racism within the criminal justice system. However, this erasure impacts not just victims of their crimes but also all Black women and girls who experience abuse. And Jennifer M. Gómez, Ph.D., says, “We are fully capable of acknowledging, disapproving, and advocating against the racism within the criminal justice system, while also not accepting sexual abuse at the hands of R. Kelly or any Black man.” Preach.
Additionally, she says it’s time to ask ourselves questions that make us uncomfortable. For the sake of this story, three seem to be the most urgent:
Will we allow a racist criminal justice system to dictate how we deal with sexual abuse in the Black community?
Are we willing to sacrifice Black women and girls to protect the Black men who rape them from a discriminatory justice system?
Why are innocent Black women and girls perceived as less important than a guilty, powerful Black man?
For some, these questions may be tough to ask and ponder. Still, they are always essential because Gómez says, “discomfort should push us to change culturally within the Black community.”
Support organizations that lend therapized support to Black women.
Watts is a champion of trauma-informed therapy as a tool to help survivors. Still, she notes, “There also needs to be some cultural competence [because of] how our society views Black girls and Black women because it increases the risk of being victimized,” Gómez shares that organizations like the National Organization of Sisters of Color Ending Sexual Assault do essential work that centers Black women and girls. The Loveland Foundation also makes therapy available to Black women and girls via their therapy fund.
Be mindful of how you speak about victims and survivors.
When discussing these painful topics, read the room. If one in four Black girls will be victimized by the time they turn 18, chances are someone you know, and love is sadly a part of that statistic. And Watts says hearing these conversations can impact how safe someone feels about disclosing their experience.
“When we’re around people making judgments and harsh criticisms about victims, we have a choice to challenge those people on their thinking, and we also have a choice to not provide an audience for it and not engage,” she says.
If you find yourself in an environment where the discourse is unsafe, Watts says to take note of how people in the room are responding and gently follow up with anyone that seems impacted by the statements so they know you’re a safe person in an unsafe space.",2023-01-10T18:17:21Z,https://www.essence.com,Essence
Aaliyah's Uncle Still Worked With R. Kelly After Marriage Annulment,"One of Aaliyah’s relatives is facing backlash after the latest episode of Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter.
In episode three of the jaw-dropping series, Kelly’s former backup dancer, Naia Vestal, who met the singer in 1994, revealed that Aaliyah’s uncle, Barry Hankerson, lied when he said he stopped working with the former singer. Dr. Oz interviewed Hankerson in 2021 when the former music manager made these claims but Vestal pushed back during the latest episode of Surviving R. Kelly. She said that Hankerson was still working alongside Kelly on business ventures.

“I just remember hearing [him] on the radio,” Vestal said. “I was in Houston driving to work, and Barry Hankerson, his former manager, was saying, ‘Oh when I found out about him messing with my niece Aaliyah, I stopped working with him.’ Nov. of 1994, when I met him, Barry was still his manager. Barry ate breakfast with us.”
Vestal wasn’t the only person who refuted Hankerson’s claims. Jovante Cunningham stated that Aaliyah’s uncle decided to quietly manage R. Kelly, despite his initial intentions to cut ties with the singer.
“I remember coming off tour and Robert saying that he wasn’t gonna renew his management contract with Barry,” she explained. “Barry said, ‘If you don’t renew my management contract, I’m gonna pull the plug on you and Aaliyah.’ And Robert didn’t, or so I thought. And maybe two or three days later is when we found out about the marriage. I didn’t know anything about it.”
According to one of Kelly’s victims, Hankerson is far from innocent in Kelly’s predatorial behavior, even if his involvement in the singer’s schemes were indirect. Lizzette Martinez said she met Hankerson in 1995 following the annulment of Aaliyah and Kelly’s marriage. “For him to be sitting there with underage girls knowing what he had just done to his niece, I don’t know if I really have a lot of respect for this person,” she said.

Surviving R. Kelly Says Aaliyah’s Family Forced to Sign NDA,"R. Kelly Photo: Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune via Getty Images
Surviving R. Kelly, the revelatory Lifetime documentary series that has illuminated the star’s myriad horrific sex crimes, grooming, and child abuse, detailed new allegations about the end of Kelly’s unlawful marriage to the then-teenage Aaliyah. According to multiple sources in the docuseries, Aaliyah’s family agreed to an NDA after the annulment with one source saying the family promised not to press charges if Kelly sold the family the rights to his first three albums. The late “Rock the Boat” singer entered into an illegal marriage with Kelly in August 1994, when she was 15 years old and he was 27. Her parents reportedly annulled the marriage — the license of which illegally listed Aaliyah’s age as 18 — in February 1995. Because Aaliyah’s father was so angered by the events, the family agreed to signing the NDA and to avoiding legal action if Kelly sold them the rights to the albums, according to Kelly’s longtime friend and former bodyguard Gem Pratt.
Although this is not the first time reports of the NDA have surfaced, the new details come after a year of reckoning for the convicted R&B singer. In federal court last year, a Chicago jury found Kelly guilty of three counts of child pornography and three counts of enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity. Aaliyah was named as Jane Doe No. 1 in that trial. Last year also saw Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison in a New York court after being found guilty on all counts in a sex-crimes and racketeering case, which saw testimony from 11 accusers (six of whom were underage when the abuse began). Surviving R. Kelly’s final episodes don’t focus solely on legal agreements. Survivor Ebonié Doyle claims Kelly raped her days after his marriage to Aaliyah, forced her to sit in a sexual position for hours until he liked her posture, and pushed her down the stairs after she found a sex tape of him and Aaliyah.",2023-01-05T13:39:31Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
‘Surviving R. Kelly’ Claims Singer Forced Aaliyah to Sign Annulment NDA,"The final two installments of Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly docuseries series ended with a pair of bombshell revelations about the imprisoned singer’s controversial marriage to a then-underage Aaliyah. The two episodes that debuted on Monday and Tuesday, focused in on Kelly’s 2022 federal trial, which included allegations that the singer and his team allegedly forced Aaliyah’s family to sign a non-disclosure agreement in the wake of the annulment of the performers’ brief marriage.
Kelly and Aaliyah were married in secret in August 1994 when the “Rock the Boat” singer was just 15, even though their marriage certificate listed her age as 18; the marriage was reportedly annulled by Aaliyah’s parents in Feb. 1995. Interviews with some of Kelly’s and Aaliyah’s entourages revealed some of the details of the NDA, which reportedly came after Aaliyah’s father was incensed by the marriage.
Longtime friend and former bodyguard Gem Pratt told the Surviving team that Aaliyah’s family signed a contract with Kelly that promised they would not press charges against him for the illegal marriage after the annulment if Kelly promised to sell them the rights to his first three albums. During last year’s federal trial a jury found Kelly guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity; Aaliyah was referred to as Jane Doe #1 at that trial.
“Her dad [Michael Haughton] didn’t want her anywhere near him,” Pratt said in the series about wanting to put distance between Kelly, who was 27 at at the time of the marriage, and Aaliyah, whose debut album, Age Ain’t Nothing But a Number — released when she was 14 — was produced and mostly written by Kelly. The stories of Kelly and Aaliyah’s secret marriage were rumored at the time, but the final episodes of the Lifetimes series put the details of the aftermath into sharper focus.
They include allegations about members of Kelly’s inner circle allegedly looking the other way at Kelly’s abuse of women girls and young men over decades, with Pratt saying that “He [Kelly] couldn’t do this by himself… it’s clear as day there were enablers.” Variety noted that the Aaliyah NDA came up during Kelly’s 2022 New York trial, though it did not receive widespread media coverage at the time; Chicago reporter Jim DeRogatis originally broke the news of the NDA, telling the New York Times Popcast podcast in 2018 that the agreement was a “harrowing document… A non-disclosure agreement on both her part and Kelly’s, vowing not to pursue further legal claims for physical abuse. So, it wasn’t just an underage sexual relationship, he hit her, allegedly, according to that court document.”
A lawyer for Kelly had not returned Billboard‘s request for comment about the NDA at press time and Kelly has maintained his innocence and is appealing the convictions.
In Sept. 2021, Kelly was found guilty in a New York trial of nine counts, including racketeering and 14 underlying acts including sexual exploitation of a child, kidnapping, bribery and sex trafficking charges, as well as eight counts of violating the sex trafficking law known as the Mann Act. In June 2022, Kelly, 55, was sentenced to 30 years in prison; the singer is still facing additional sentencing in Chicago as well as pending felony sex crime charges in Minnesota.
The final chapters of producer/director Dream Hampton’s Surviving series also included new allegations of Kelly’s sexual abuse from a survivor named Ebonié Doyle, who claimed she was raped by Kelly just days after his marriage to Aaliyah. Doyle said she was 16 when Kelly’s limo pulled up on her after one of his shows, setting off a relationship that resulted in her mother kicking Doyle out of the house when she discovered it.
After moving in with Kelly, Doyle said she became subject to Kelly’s “controlling” ways, which included forcing her to sit in a specific sexual position for hours until her posture was to his liking. At the time there were whispers about the singer’s relationship with the underage Aaliyah — Doyle noticed she and the singer were similar in stature and appearance — and said at one point she found a sex tape featuring Kelly and Aaliyah. When Kelly found out that she’d seen the tape, Doyle said he pushed her down a flight of stairs.",2023-01-04T17:08:02Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
R. Kelly Made Aaliyah's Family Sign NDA,"R Kelly is behind bars but a critical piece of media that ensured his initial arrest was Lifetime’s Surviving R Kelly series. The documentary dove into the decades-old allegations of sexual abuse against the singer, and eventually, led authorities to arrest him and pressing charges.
Most recently, Lifetime unveiled the third installment in the Surviving R. Kelly series. Dubbed The Final Chapter, the latest season explores his illegal marriage to singer Aaliyah when she was only 15 years old.

Aaliyah was listed as Jane Doe #1 in Kelly’s 2002 federal trial, and the NDA that she and her family signed was introduced as evidence. However, the doc further details the NDA from those closest to Kelly, including the singer’s bodyguard, Gem Pratt.
Members of Aaliyah’s family didn’t comment on the series. However, Pratt detailed her father’s outrage over the marriage. After demanding an annulment, Kelly arranged an agreement that prevented Aaliyah’s family from pressing charges. In exchange, Kelly sold the rights to his first three albums to her family.
“Her dad didn’t want her anywhere near him,” Pratt said of Aaliyah’s father.
Pratt admitted that there were plenty of enablers in Kelly’s corner prior to his arrest. Meanwhile, prosecutors and legal experts explained that these were critical for the singer’s “criminal enterprise.”
“He couldn’t do this by himself. It’s impossible…It’s clear as day there were enablers,” said Pratt. “This was not a one-man operation. Most people in that camp knew that a lot of these girls were underage. They had to.”
The executive producer of Surviving R. Kelly, Jesse Daniels, explained that they tried to approach the topic as delicately as possible to ensure that they respected her legacy.
“We have had a lot of conversations about how to tell Aaliyah’s story every time because we really want to be respectful of her legacy. But what she went through, we can’t turn our backs on,” said Daniels.
We will keep you posted on anymore developments from Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter.

R. Kelly silenced Aaliyah and her family through a non-disclosure agreement, following his marriage and subsequent annulment to the then 15-year-old singer.
The new allegations were made in the final installment of Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly,” which aired on Jan. 2 and Jan. 3. The docuseries centered around R. Kelly’s 2022 federal trial where the NDA was brought up in the courtroom as evidence. The late Aaliyah was Jane Doe #1 in the trial.

“Surviving R. Kelly” utilizes Aaliyah’s story to spotlight her as a victim of R. Kelly, after years of the media and music industry scandalizing her marriage to the now-convicted singer in the 90′s.
Aaliyah’s debut album in 1994 was titled “Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number” and was recorded when she was 14-years-old. R. Kelly -- who was Aaliyah’s mentor and was first introduced to her by her uncle, music executive and manager Barry Hankerson -- was a lead songwriter and producer of the album. At the time the album was released, rumors circulated that there was a relationship between the 15-year-old Aaliyah and the 27-year-old R. Kelly.

The pair secretly married in August 1994. Aaliyah was 15 at the time, but the marriage certificate falsified her age as 18. The marriage was annulled by Aaliyah’s parents in Feb. 1995.
In “Surviving R. Kelly,” on-camera interviews with individuals from R. Kelly’s camp who were in the room when the duo wed express their regret over the marriage. Individuals who were close to both R. Kelly and Aaliyah share new details about the legal agreement that was allegedly forged between R. Kelly and Aaliyah’s family.
Members of Aaliyah’s family declined to comment to producers of “Surviving R. Kelly,” per a statement that aired as part of the Lifetime docuseries.
A childhood friend of R. Kelly and his former security, Gem Pratt, appears in “Surviving R. Kelly” and claims that Aaliyah’s father was furious over the marriage and forced the annulment. Pratt alleges that Aaliyah’s family had a contractual arrangement with R. Kelly that stated they wouldn’t press charges against him for the illegal marriage after it was annulled; in turn, R. Kelly sold the rights to his first three albums to Aaliyah’s family, giving them a financial incentive.
“Her dad didn’t want her anywhere near him,” Pratt says in the docuseries.
Various on-camera guests in “Surviving R. Kelly” described the marriage as a way to get R. Kelly to avoid jail time for statutory rape of a minor.
The final episodes of “Surviving R. Kelly” dedicate time to covering the enablers in R. Kelly’s camp, who turned a blind eye to his abuse over three decades and helped the convicted musician make arrangements to see his victims, including booking flights for underage girls to cross state lines for private meetings. One prosecutor who appeared as a legal expert in the docuseries described R. Kelly as “running a criminal enterprise.” Another expert said “everyone had a financial incentive to look the other way.”
“He couldn’t do this by himself. It’s impossible...It’s clear as day there were enablers,” said R. Kelly’s former security guard, Pratt. He later said, “This was not a one-man operation. Most people in that camp knew that a lot of these girls were underage. They had to.”

The NDA was brought up in R. Kelly’s New York trial in 2022, but did not receive widespread coverage. The use of NDAs has become a hot-button issue in sexual harassment cases, particularly in the workplace, highlighting an imbalance of power with the perpetrator or corporations silencing victims through forced legal documents.
Prior to R. Kelly’s trial, journalist Jim DeRogatis -- the reporter who first broke news of R. Kelly’s sexual abuse more than two decades ago -- uncovered the NDA that R. Kelly used against Aaliyah. A few years ago, DeRogatis spoke about the documents that were leaked to him, stating in an interview that the annulment and Aaliyah’s legal claim against R. Kelly had been sealed.
“It’s a harrowing document,” he said. “A non-disclosure agreement on both her part and Kelly’s, vowing not to pursue further legal claims for physical abuse. So, it wasn’t just an underage sexual relationship, he hit her, allegedly, according to that court document.”
Speaking to Variety about the final installment of “Surviving R. Kelly,” executive producer Jesse Daniels said that the producing team was careful not to exploit Aaliyah in the docuseries, and hoped to highlight the abuse she tragically endured by R. Kelly when she was a teenager. “We have had a lot of conversations about how to tell Aaliyah’s story every time because we really want to be respectful of her legacy.

“It’s a harrowing document,” he said. “A non-disclosure agreement on both her part and Kelly’s, vowing not to pursue further legal claims for physical abuse. So, it wasn’t just an underage sexual relationship, he hit her, allegedly, according to that court document.”
Speaking to Variety about the final installment of “Surviving R. Kelly,” executive producer Jesse Daniels said that the producing team was careful not to exploit Aaliyah in the docuseries, and hoped to highlight the abuse she tragically endured by R. Kelly when she was a teenager. “We have had a lot of conversations about how to tell Aaliyah’s story every time because we really want to be respectful of her legacy. But what she went through, we can’t turn our backs on,” said Daniels.",2023-01-04T00:48:57Z,https://variety.com,Variety
"Final ""Surviving R. Kelly"" Doc To Show How Singer Allegedly Groomed Young Men","When it first emerged on Lifetime, the Surviving R. Kelly series had pop culture in a chokehold. It was then that we were first introduced to young women like Joycelyn Savage, Kelly’s purported “girlfriend,” as well as her parents who were desperately searching for her. Several other women who were alleged victims of Kelly’s suggested sex crimes also shared their stories, further thrusting the hitmaker into infamy.
The third and final installment of the docuseries is soon approaching, and Variety sat down with executive producer Jesse Daniels. He has been a part of the development since its inception, and although Kelly faces more trials, Daniels says Part III will be the last.
“For us, this is it,” said Daniels. “Whatever else R. Kelly faces is a minor footnote compared to the New York federal trial and the Illinois federal trial. I am speaking to our survivors today and their families and many of them are successfully working on turning a page on their own personal lives.”
“This was, for them, a really difficult time. Their journey through the trial was incredibly difficult. They feel ready to move [on to] the next chapter, and so are we.”
Additionally, Daniels shared that this final chapter will detail the allegations of Kelly grooming young men. This was something that was brought up during his trial in August 2022.

“Our goal was to create a real 360-degree look at what was unfolding every day of the trial, and that certainly was a big chapter of the trial where there were male victims who testified. It was certainly something that we had heard in the past, but not in the context of this trial. We felt obligated to tell the whole the arc of the trial and every detail that we could.”
During his trial, an alleged Jane Doe victim of Kelly claimed she was forced to have sex with a young man the singer was said to have groomed. Kelly has denied all allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviors.

The trial that put R. Kelly behind bars in 2021 is at the center of the third and final installment of “Surviving R. Kelly,” which premieres on Lifetime on Jan. 2 and 3. Cable-cutters can also stream the new episodes on live TV streaming platforms such as Sling TV, Fubo TV, DirecTV Stream and Hulu + Live TV.
Things look a lot different for the disgraced rapper since the series began over four years ago amid resurfaced allegations. Kelly is now serving a 30-year sentence after being found guilty on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking in 2022. The new episodes follow survivors and their families as they prepare to testify in high-profile court proceedings, and also focuses on the journalists who covered the trial.
“We are in a very different place at the start of this installment than we were over four years ago when we started this journey. He’s facing some very serious crimes,” executive producer Jesse Daniels told Variety ahead of the series premiere. “As we continued to stay in touch with our survivors, we started to hear about the pressure and the toll of preparing for this trial and gathering the courage to take the stand. We realize it’s hard enough for a survivor to tell their story in front of the camera, but to do so again while facing your abuser and his legal team is absolutely terrifying and incredibly brave. We really realized that we had a whole new story to tell here.”
The new episodes reveal chilling details about the abuser’s alleged grooming of men, in addition to his widely speculated to be fraudulent marriage and annulment with then-15 year old Aaliyah.

‘Surviving R. Kelly’ docuseries’ final installment reveals details about singer’s grooming of young men,"When the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” debuted four years ago, R. Kelly was a free man. The R&B singer’s career had long been trailed by allegations of abusing underage girls, which first arose in the early ‘90s, but he remained one of the most successful hitmakers of that decade and into the 2000s. Also during that time, Kelly was briefly jailed and brought to trial for a 2002 indictment on 21 counts of child pornography. He was acquitted in 2008.
Kelly’s circumvention of the justice system damaged his career as an artist, but didn’t end it. It wasn’t until “Surviving R. Kelly” premiered in early 2019 that public opinion began to change. The series was greenlit prior to the initial impact of the #MeToo movement in October 2017, and was the first programming event of the #MeToo era to give a voice to survivors, ultimately bringing justice from the screen to a court of law. The series centers around Black women’s stories, an underrepresented group when it comes to social justice.

Today, Kelly is serving out a 30-year sentence in prison, after being found guilty on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking in 2022. Kelly was also found guilty in Chicago on three counts of child pornography for filming himself sexually abusing his then-14-year-old goddaughter. He still faces charges in other jurisdictions.
The third and final installment of “Surviving R. Kelly” centers around the trial that put Kelly behind bars, following the survivors and their families as the prepare to testify at the high-profile court proceeding. The new episodes also focuses on the journalists who covered the trial, as well as other legal and trauma experts.

“We are in a very different place at the start of this installment than we were over four years ago when we started this journey. He’s facing some very serious crimes,” says executive producer Jesse Daniels, who has been involved with “Surviving R. Kelly” from the start and was actively involved in developing the groundbreaking series.
In 2017, Daniels read a Buzzfeed article written by Jim DeRogatis, the journalist who broke the R. Kelly dam with a 2000 report in the Chicago Sun-Times, which is widely credited as the first domino to fall in R. Kelly’s empire. Despite that report and video evidence, which was at the center of R. Kelly’s 2008 trial, the criminal justice system took decades to catch up to DeRogatis’ investigative work and the accounts of survivors. “I remember the story made an impact, but after that, nothing really had happened,” Daniels says of the 2017 article. At that time, Daniels spoke with his fellow producers and asking why nothing had happened. With that, “Surviving R. Kelly” was born. “That was the inspiration and the motivation to investigate this further,” he says.
Accusers of R. Kelly have said he kept them as sex slaves, essentially part of a cult, locked in his home with no access to their families or the outside world. He would groom young women and men who had aspirations to become singers, and record them as he forced them into sexual acts. The six-week trial in 2022 revealed how R. Kelly used employees and intermediaries to lure fans and hopeful singers into sexually abusive and controlling conditions, including locking them in rooms without food or access to a bathroom for days.
During his 2022 federal trial in New York, “Surviving R. Kelly” was mentioned 150 times in the courtroom.
In the first installment of “Surviving R. Kelly,” parents of the victims spoke about trying to get their daughters back home. But one family is still fighting. Joycelyn Savage was 19 years old when she met Kelly, and the two are purportedly engaged. Last year, she released a book where she said she was carrying R. Kelly’s child, and just last month, she posted a photo of a newborn baby announcing that she welcomed a new baby with the imprisoned R. Kelly, though his attorney has denied her claim.
Savage’s parents are featured heavily in “Surviving R. Kelly,” emotionally discussing their fight to re-connect with their daughter. The final installment also introduces a new anonymous accuser who gives a harrowing account of allegedly being drugged and raped by R. Kelly. The episodes delve into the revelation that R. Kelly abused young boys, and give new detail into the widely speculated marriage and annulment of R. Kelly and then-15 year old Aaliyah.
“Surviving R. Kelly” executive producer Jesse Daniels spoke to Variety about the final installment.
What sort of impact do you believe the docuseries has had on R. Kelly’s legal cases?
Advertisement
When we started speaking with survivors and families, the world was in a much different place. This was pre-#MeTo movement [and] the survivors were worried that they were not going to be heard or believed. They were, as they’ve said, shouting into the wind. Where we are now at part three, which is the start of a trial where R. Kelly has faced many, many charges that are tied to the allegations made by our survivors. I can’t speak for our survivors, but I believe that they feel heard finally and believed.
“Surviving R. Kelly” without a doubt had an impact on the charges that were made. But we also really have to give a nod to the journalists who kept the story going for so many years - journalists such as Jim DeRogatis who’s been on this story for over 30 years, and those who attended the trial day in and day out; that is not an easy job to report on. Keeping the story alive and giving survivors a platform we owe them, it’s not just “Surviving R. Kelly,” but many people who contributed to that.
At what point did the producers decide to do a third installment?
After part one, we said that was it. But as we continued to stay in touch with our survivors, we started to hear about the pressure and the toll of preparing for this trial and gathering the courage to take the stand. We realize it’s hard enough for a survivor to tell their story in front of the camera, but to do so again while facing your abuser and his legal team is absolutely terrifying and incredibly brave. We really realized that we had a whole new story to tell here.
Part three has been announced as the final installment, but R. Kelly is still facing more charges. Do you have any plans to produce more?
For us, this is it. Whatever else R. Kelly faces is a minor footnote compared to the New York federal trial and the Illinois federal trial. I am speaking to our survivors today and their families, and many of them are successfully working on turning a page on their own personal lives. This was, for them, a really difficult time. Their journey through the trial was incredibly difficult. They feel ready to move onto the next chapter, and so are we.

Did you reach out to R. Kelly for an interview?
Legally, we have to. Every season, we reach out with a list of allegations and give an opportunity to speak on those, whether it’s via a written response or an interview.
This is clearly a series focused on the survivors, but was there ever a creative interest to get R. Kelly to sit down on-camera to actually hear from him, and not just as a legal checkpoint?
This is a story that gives a platform for survivors to speak, but as producers, we try our best to remain neutral in telling the story, and so, we believe that giving a 360-degree look at what has happened over the past 30 years is incredibly important. We certainly do try our best to reach out to anybody and everybody involved, whether it’s him or those in his camp.
You have extensive interviews with parents of the survivors and the common thread in this installment is that they have all gotten their girls back, except for Joycelyn’s parents who are in a completely different situation. What do you think their motive was in sitting down for an interview?
It’s a good question. At the very start of “Surviving R. Kelly,” we had several parents who were still trying to get in touch with their daughters, and now, at the start of part three, for the first time, we actually see parents sit down together in front of the camera, which was incredibly emotional. Tragically, the Savages were the only was the only family left who had not been in touch with their daughter. I can’t speak to how they feel now, but my heart goes out to their family.

Joycelyn said that she gave birth to R. Kelly’s baby, which his attorney denied. I’m not sure if you’ve kept in touch with the family, but do you have any more information on that situation?
All I can say is that my heart goes out to them. While I keep up with the day-to-day as much as possible, I can’t comment further on what’s happening there.
The New York trial revealed that R. Kelly also abused young men, and not just women. This installment delves into those allegations and you have an expert who says that R. Kelly’s story expanded from sexual abuse to predation. Why was it important to include that?
Our goal was to create a real 360-degree look at what was unfolding every day of the trial, and that certainly was a big chapter of the trial where there were male victims who testified. It was certainly something that we had heard in the past, but not in the context of this trial. We felt obligated to tell the whole the arc of the trial and every detail that we could.
This installment also goes very deep into R. Kelly’s marriage to Aaliyah when she was 15 years-old. What part did Aaliyah play into the overall story of R. Kelly’s abuse?
Aaliyah is Jane Doe #1 in the New York federal trial. That alone speaks volumes. We really tried to respectfully tell that story about Aaliyah, and simple because she was Jane Doe #1 in this trial, there was no turning away from that. I’m paraphrasing here, but in this installment, Jim DeRogatis says that Aaliyah’s name for the first time was spoken in a court of law in what is one of the biggest scandals in the history of popular music. I agree with him.
Advertisement
Did you have any concern about exploiting Aaliyah’s story, since she is not here with us to comment on what is being said about her?
Of course. We have had a lot of conversations about how to tell Aaliyah’s story every time because we really want to be respectful of her legacy. But what she went through, we can’t turn our backs on, so as her story got brought up tragically once again, but now in the court of law, we decided, to try really hard to retell what happened in that courtroom as it concerned to Aaliyah in the most respectful way possible.
Something that was revealed in the trial, but was not widely reported on, is that R. Kelly utilized NDAs to silence the women he preyed on, including Aaliyah. You provide more information regarding R. Kelly’s use of NDAs in this series, which has not been discussed much before.
I’m glad you picked up on that one. It’s a very important detail, but also a very chilling takeaway that came from the trial.
The series covers various intimidation attempts that the survivors and their families share. In late 2018, a gun threat was called into the premiere of “Surviving R. Kelly,” which was widely expected at the time to have come from a member of R. Kelly’s team trying to stop the premiere screening. Just this past month, his former manager, Donnell Russell, was sentenced to a year in prison for that shooting threat. Did that feel like a full circle moment that he was sentenced just as this final installment is about to come out?
I don’t feel comfortable speaking to the actual charges, but I can say personally, that night was one of the most terrifying nights of my life, and my biggest worry that night was that this was supposed to be a night to honor our survivors, and instead, they had been re-traumatized yet again.

What do you hope that viewers learn from the complexities of survivors of sexual abuse through watching this?
We’ve tried to break down just how difficult it is to leave an abusive situation, and then just how difficult it is to heal from an abusive situation. That conversation, in every single chapter, is one of the most important themes to talk about because we believe that viewers at home can learn from that, and hopefully, we can spark conversations at home on this topic.",2023-01-03T13:12:27Z,https://www.chicagotribune.com,Chicago Tribune

America’s Got Talent: All-Stars
After the recent controversy about his appearance, it will be fascinating to see Simon Cowell return for a new season of “America’s Got Talent.” Despite the judge making global headlines for how different he looks in a spot promoting the new series, the real focus will be on this season’s cast. It features winners, finalists, and fan favourites from around the world as they all attempt to win the title of the ultimate All-Star. I remember when something like this was attempted in 2004 with “World Idol,” when Norway’s Kurt Nilsen destroyed the competition that included original “Canadian Idol” Ryan Malcolm and the first “American Idol,” Kelly Clarkson. Coincidentally, Simon Cowell was also involved in that project. That show didn’t really make a lasting impact so let’s see if A.G.T. will be different.

R. Kelly Survivor Says He Assaulted Her After Discovering His Aaliyah Sex Tape,"Damning accusations and anecdotes concerning R. Kelly’s history of abuse still shook audiences years after its initial revelation. Moreover, many of these came as part of Surviving R. Kelly, a docuseries by Dream Hampton and journalist Jim DeRogatis. Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter is the final four-part segment of this documentary. Also, it airs for two consecutive nights on January 2nd and 3rd and contains more pained testimonies from victims. One of the most worrisome stories detailed how R. Kelly assaulted a survivor after she discovered his Aaliyah sex tape.

Survivor Ebonié Doyle shared her experiences with DeRogatis in November of 2021, and her story is in The Final Chapter. In it, she talks about how she first became acquainted with the R&B singer and how his mistreatment developed.
“I was 16 years old when I met Rob in 1993. My friends and I went to a show, and he was there with other artists, and I just remember his voice was just amazing,” she remarked. “After the show, my girlfriend and I were waiting outside, we were ready to go to our cars, and a limousine pulls up.”
Then, she said, Kelly invited them to his hotel room, and went on to be involved in Doyle’s personal life. She said he would have his tour bus wait outside of her high school for her, and even went to her graduation. After her mother kicked her out of the house for seeing him, Doyle moved in with the 55-year-old.
Free R Kelly is something that never should be trending
I was a junior at one of the high schools he would go to as grown ass man
& the girl in the video that got exposed was a freshman at that same school
Kelly is a predator & pedo, a hurt person that hurt others

While with Kelly, she stated, she found that he was “really controlling … certain things sexually he liked his way.” The star made her arch her back for “literally hours” so it would be to his liking. Also, she confessed that R. Kelly denied claims that he had a relationship with an underage Aaliyah, which took a darker turn.
“I see this basket full of tapes, and I’m like, ‘Well, maybe I’ll just grab one of these tapes, and let me go in the other rooms and see if there’s a VHS so I can watch a movie,’ because I was bored,” she expressed. “That’s when I discovered that he’d been lying to me about Aaliyah.
“The tape that I put in was of him and Aaliyah together,” she continued. “What I saw on that tape was he and Aaliyah being intimate. They were on the tour bus, and everything that I had asked him was confirmed on the tape.”
When Kelly returned home, an argument over the tape ensued, during which he pushed Doyle down the stairs, leaving her in shock.
“That shake sent me down flights of stairs, and I just laid there. I just froze. That was the moment where I realized [how] to pick and choose my battles.
“Like, I loved him … I love [Kelly],” she went on. “He’s still important to me. And so, he’s not some horrible man to me. And I don’t want people to think that,” Doyle tells her pal. “I just wish that he would get the help he needs. Like, he’s not a bad person, he just does bad things. Does that make [sense]?”
What do you think of these disturbing revelations about R. Kelly? Let us know in the comments down below. Also, as always, stay tuned to HNHH for the latest in the R. Kelly saga.

R. Kelly Confirms He Didn't Have A Child With Joycelyn Savage,"Even from behind bars, R. Kelly continues to be in the headlines. Over the past few days, rumors began circulating on social media that his alleged fiancée, Joycelyn Savage, gave birth to his kid. However, her father, Timothy Savage, has since denied these claims.
Taking to his Instagram account on Tuesday (December 27), he went live to address the situation. “The little baby on the account is a pretty little baby. If I had a granddaughter, I would be the first to say I love this child, no matter what the situation is. These people are evil, cruel people. To take a horrible situation and try to make some profit off of it,” he says.
Mr. Savage goes on to say that a fake Instagram account claiming to be his daughter is responsible for making the announcement and subsequently stirring up the gossip.
Furthermore, a new update on Wednesday (December 28) provides audio recordings of the disgraced singer speaking from prison. In an exclusive interview with Rick Party of The Natasha Simona Sequence show, the 55-year-old also denies that Savage gave birth to his child. “I can’t name names, I can just say, Joycelyn is my fiancée, and I love her and she loves me, and we’re together. I can say that. She is not in my case or none of that. She’s not against me,” says Kelly during the phone conversation.
When Party asks him directly if the rumors are true, the disgraced singer is quick to speak out. “Hell nah! That’s what I’m sayin’. She didn’t have a child. I didn’t put out no damn album. If I did put out an album, it wouldn’t be called I Admit It. We gotta start using our common sense at some point,” he says afterward.
This all stems from comments made by Savage earlier this year. In August, she claimed to be pregnant with the 55-year-old’s child in a shocking tell-all. Although all other parties have denied this to be true, it should be noted that Savage herself has yet to speak out.
The “Ignition” singer remains behind bars, where he is currently serving a 30-year sentence for his various crimes, including sex trafficking and racketeering.
Finally, make sure to stay tuned to HNHH for the latest updates in music and pop culture.

Joycelyn Savage’s Father Denies R.Kelly Baby Rumors,"Joycelyn Savage’s dad is coming forth after rumors surfaced that his daughter gave birth to R. Kelly’s child. Timothy Savage slammed an Instagram account claiming to be his 26-year old daughter, announcing that she welcomed daughter “Ava Lee Kelly 12.08.22.”
The alleged faux account shared a second post pretending to be Joycelyn. “My baby girl Ava when you were born and my whole world shined so bright. I knew that it was no longer about me anymore it was about us . Though the world is cold , I promise to always protect you . I am so happy to be your mother & you bring me so much joy.”

However, Timothy says the page is fraudulent and that his daughter has not welcomed a child with the incarcerated singer. “My daughter Joycelyn is not pregnant,” he shared on Instagram Live. “This is 100% accurate. Rest assured. I am investigating this to the fullest and other people are too.” Savage’s video didn’t end there. He went on to call out the folks responsible for posting the unknown baby in the IG photo. “The little baby on the account is a pretty little baby. If I had a granddaughter, I would be the first to say I love this child, no matter what the situation is. These people are evil, cruel people. To take a horrible situation and try to make some profit off of it.”
“My daughter has been hidden away from everyone, due to the circumstances. And it’s not right. If it was the case that my daughter had a child, [she] would come forth and be happy about it. But as we both know, my daughter has not responded. I have messaged that [Instagram] to see if that was my daughter. It has not responded in the proper way.”
Fans quickly slammed the seemingly concerned father, accusing him of reading from a script and not being genuine. Check out Timothy’s full video and share your thoughts below.",2022-12-28T15:08:04Z,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com,HotNewHipHop
2022 a Big Year for Celebrity Trials. More Are Expected in 2023,"Johnny Depp v. Amber Heard became the biggest story in America

Perhaps the biggest case to go to trial in 2022 was Johnny Depp's defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife, Amber Heard. Depp sued Heard for defamation, claiming she ruined his reputation by insinuating in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed that she had been the victim of domestic violence, and he claimed he had been the real victim in their marriage.
Heard countersued and spent several days on the stand describing multiple incidents in which she alleged Depp abused her before and during their marriage.
After a six-week trial that quickly became the biggest talking point in America, the jury largely sided with Depp, ordering Heard to pay him $15 million in damages. The jury also found Depp liable for defamation, but only for one of the three complaints Heard made. The damage award was also much lower, just $2 million. Both Depp and Heard have appealed, so this story is far from over.",2022-12-26T05:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER

His meal reportedly includes herbed Cornish hen, eggplant parmesan, dirty rice, baked beans, green beans, dinner rolls, fruit, pies and juice.
R. Kelly, on the other hand, is serving his 30-year sentence at MCC Chicago. The disgraced singer is guilty of various sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The world was witness to his sentencing earlier this year. His meal will consist of baked Cornish hen, green beans, cornbread dressing, mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole.
Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted on five of the six counts against her for her role in aiding Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of underage girls. She’s currently serving her time at FCI Tallahassee. She’ll be eating Cornish hens, stuffed green peppers, garlic mac and cheese, brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, rolls, cranberry sauce, red velvet cheesecake and fruit.

The report also says that some buildings will be handing out gift bags to prisoners. They will reportedly include snacks, puzzles and games.
In other news surrounding the “Trap Queen” rapper, some new photos have recently surfaced of him in prison. In October of 2021, the New Jersey native was arrested and subsequently charged stemming from a conspiracy to possess and distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine.
The photos were shared to his official Instagram account on Saturday (December 24). “Head up like a nose bleed Mr. New Jersey,” reads the caption.
His sentencing will take place soon, on January 18, 2023. He faces a minimum of five years, with the maximum time he could serve set at 40 years.

"Biggest Music Law Stories of 2022: Taylor Swift, Cardi B, R. Kelly","Whether it was Taylor Swift or Prince or Cardi B, 2022 saw major legal battles involving some of the music industry’s biggest stars, ranging from never-ending copyright fights to sprawling criminal cases centered on rap lyrics. Some stars, like Katy Perry, won big; others, like Young Thug and Gunna, faced repeated setbacks; still others, like Megan Thee Stallion and Ed Sheeran, just got exhausted. To catch up, here are 10 big music law stories that you need to remember from 2022.
Taylor Swift Finally Shakes It Off
There was no bigger music copyright lawsuit than the long-running case accusing Taylor Swift of stealing the lyrics to “Shake It Off.” Since 2017, songwriters Sean Hall and Nathan Butler had argued that Swift’s song (an all-time smash hit that spent 50 weeks on Hot 100) stole some of its core lyrics from “Playas Gon’ Play,” a 2001 song they wrote for the R&B group 3LW. And despite arguments from Swift’s white-shoe lawyers that lyrics about “playas” and “haters” were too commonplace to be monopolized under copyright law, federal courts repeatedly refused to dismiss the case. Following in the wake of earlier battles over Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” and Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse,” the lawsuit raised big questions about where copyright protection ends and the public domain begins. Those questions were set to be answered at a blockbuster trial in January – until Swift and her accusers reached a sudden settlement earlier this month.
Rap On Trial: A Year of Highs and Lows
Despite widespread criticism of the practice, prosecutors continued to cite rap lyrics as evidence in criminal cases in 2022, most prominently when Young Thug and Gunna were indicted in May as part of a sweeping gang case against dozens of members of the Atlanta rap crew YSL. The charges included numerous references to Young Thug and Gunna’s music, claiming lyrics were the kind of “predicate acts” that contributed to the overall criminal enterprise. And Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who bought the case, offered no apologies for doing so: “If you decide to admit your crimes over a beat, I’m gonna use it,” Willis said. “I’m going to continue to do that, people can continue to be angry about it.” And yet, 2022 also saw the enactment of landmark legislation in California that would sharply restrict the practice and efforts to pass similar laws in New York state and at the federal level – hopeful signs for critics who say it unfairly targets black men and violates their First Amendment rights.
Prince Estate Case Closed – Finally
The long legal battle over Prince’s $156 million estate was finally resolved in 2022, more than six years after the iconic rocker died suddenly from a fentanyl overdose without a will. The estate had been stuck in probate court for years, under the control of a court-appointed bank as rival groups of legal heirs wrangled over the rocker’s legacy. Over time, those proceedings came to be dominated in part by Primary Wave, the music industry giant that slowly bought out various Prince heirs to amass a 50% stake in the estate. The biggest hurdle was cleared in January, when the heirs reached a deal with the Internal Revenue Service to set a final tax valuation of $156 million, followed by a ruling February on the basic structure for how the assets would be split into two groups, and then a final judicial approval in August. Prince’s legacy is now a music story and a business story, not a legal story.
Ed Sheeran’s Copyright Nightmare
Ed Sheeran says he’s tired of all the copyright lawsuits, but 2022 was something of an up-and-down year on that front. In April, he won a dramatic victory in U.K. court over his chart-topping 2017 hit “Shape of You,” when a judge ruled that he didn’t copy the song from a little-known track called “Oh Why.” Following an 11-day London trial – in which an opposing attorney called Sheeran a “magpie,” the singer repeatedly took the stand to defend himself, and he once even sang in open court – the judge ruled there was no evidence Sheeran had intentionally or even “subconsciously” copied any of the earlier material. But the respite was short-lived: In October, a federal judge in New York ruled that Sheeran must face a jury trial in a separate case claiming he borrowed key elements of his “Thinking Out Loud” from Marvin Gaye‘s iconic “Let’s Get It On. Barring a reversal (and Sheeran’s lawyers are asking for one) the decision set the stage for a blockbuster trial at some point in 2023, but a date has not yet been set.
Cardi B v. The World
Cardi B started the year with a bang, winning a $4 million defamation verdict in January against Tasha K, a gossip blogger who made salacious false claims on YouTube about drug use, STDs and prostitution. (Cardi’s lawyers are still trying to collect that money, btw.) And in October, she won at trial again, avoiding millions in damages by beating back a bizarre lawsuit filed by a California man whose back tattoos were unwittingly photoshopped onto the “raunchy” cover of Cardi’s 2016 mixtape Gangsta Bitch Music Vol. 1. The star herself took the witness stand in both trials, testifying about the pain of being defamed and sparring with an opposing lawyer over whether he had “receipts.” Oh, and Cardi also resolved a long-standing criminal case by pleading guilty in September to misdemeanor charges stemming from a 2018 bottle-throwing incident at a Queens strip club. All in all, a quiet year.
Dua Lipa’s Double-Whammy
One could argue you’re not truly a pop star until you’ve been sued for copyright infringement a few times; just ask Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran. That means Dua Lipa must have truly arrived this year, when she was hit with not one but two separate lawsuits claiming she copied earlier songs when she wrote “Levitating”– the longest-running top 10 song ever by a female artist on the Hot 100. One case was filed by a Florida reggae band named Artikal Sound System, which claimed Lipa lifted the core hook for her song from their 2015 “Live Your Life.” The other case, filed a few days later in March, accused her of copying both a 1979 song called “Wiggle and Giggle All Night” and a 1980 song called “Don Diablo.” Armed with a top-flight legal team, Lipa has already struck back in both cases – but both remain pending.
Taylor Swift … Trust Buster?
Ticketmaster’s disastrous November presale for Taylor Swift’s upcoming Eras Tour – which saw widespread service delays and website crashes as millions of fans tried (and many failed) to buy tickets – resurfaced some uncomfortable legal questions for the all-powerful concert giant and its parent company Live Nation. Those questions have never fully gone away since the two companies merged in 2010, but in the days after the fiasco, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle called for new antitrust investigations – and that was before news broke that the U.S. Department of Justice had already launched such a probe. If violations are found, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), the chair of the Senate subcommittee for antitrust issues, urged regulators to consider “breaking up the company.” Meanwhile, state attorneys general across the country are also probing the debacle, and at least one class action lawsuit has already been filed accusing the company of fraud and “anticompetitive conduct.” Hell hath no fury like Swifties scorned…
Megan Thee Stallion’s Exhausting Year
Following an October appearance on Saturday Night Live promoting the release of her album Traumazine, Megan Thee Stallion said she needed to take a break because she was “so tired, physically and emotionally.” After her 2022 legal battles, it’s hard to blame her. In February, Megan’s long fight with her former record label, 1501 Certified Entertainment, escalated significantly when she accused the company of purposefully mislabeling an album to keep her locked into the deal. 1501 quickly countersued, then Megan upped the stakes again in August with new allegations and demands for damages. And all of that had nothing to do with the even bigger Megan story: A criminal case against Tory Lanez over charges that he shot her in the foot during a July 2020 altercation in Los Angeles. When a trial in that case kicked off earlier this month, Megan took the witness stand to recount the shooting and the toll it had taken on her. “I wish he had just shot and killed me,” she tearfully recounted.
R. Kelly Gets 30 Years – And Gets Convicted Again
Things went from bad to worse for R. Kelly in 2022. After being convicted last year in New York on racketeering and sex trafficking charges, the disgraced R&B singer was sentenced to 30 years in prison on those charges in June. Then in August, he was convicted in Chicago on separate child pornography charges stemming from an infamous video tape involving him and a minor, meaning he faces decades more in prison time. His attorneys plan to appeal both convictions.
Katy Perry Wins Case and Makes Law
When Katy Perry won a copyright ruling at a federal appeals court in March, declaring that her 2013 chart-topper “Dark Horse” hadn’t infringed an earlier song, it was a bigger deal than just one case. Sure, it was important to Perry herself, who avoided $2.8 million verdict by defeating the accusations. And the star was obviously pleased, telling a Las Vegas concert crowd in a viral clip: “So just be sure…before you take me to court, ‘cause I’m a Scorpio, bitch!” But the ruling was also a clear rejection of similar infringement cases over songs, stressing that simple musical “building blocks,” like the short “ostinato” in Perry’s song, cannot be locked up by any particular songwriter because it would chill future songwriting creativity. Much like a 2020 ruling on “Stairway To Heaven,” the decision for Perry could be seen as part of a pendulum swing away from earlier decisions over Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines,” which were criticized by some for expanding music copyrights to more basic elements.",2022-12-22T17:53:30Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
R. Kelly's Manager Sentenced To One Year In Prison,"The downfall of R. Kelly and those around him continues. His former manager, Donnell Russell is now in some legal trouble himself.
On Monday (December 19), he was sentenced to one year in prison for calling in a shooting threat four years ago.

The threat occurred in 2018, when the “Surviving R. Kelly” docuseries was set to premiere at a movie theatre in Manhattan. Prosecutors say he is the one responsible for phoning in the warning. He claimed that someone in the theatre had a gun on them and planned to open fire. As a result, the audience was subsequently evacuated.
The incriminating series outlines Kelly’s sexual abuse of women and underage girls.
Other Charges Against the Former Manager
Furthermore, the disgraced singer’s ex-manager also faces more time for his role in attempting to squash sexual abuse accusations against Kelly. In July, Russell was convicted of threatening physical harm through interstate communication. He was additionally acquitted on conspiracy charges.
A federal judge later sentenced Russell to 20 months in prison. The manager plead guilty to stalking one of the singer’s accusers. He is responsible for sending threatening messages to her, as well as posting explicit photos of her on the internet.
Authorities are expecting Russell to turn himself in next year in order to serve his time for both cases simultaneously.
Just a couple of weeks ago, a mysterious R. Kelly album frighteningly called I Admit It appeared on streaming platforms. Of course, the project immediately went viral as social media users began questioning what was going on. A rep from Sony later confirmed that it was a fake album and was released without their knowledge.
The “I Believe I Can Fly” singer is currently in prison. He’s finally set to serve 30 years for his various heinous crimes, including sex trafficking and racketeering.

R. Kelly manager sentenced to year in prison for theatre threat over documentary screening,"R. Kelly’s one-time manager was sentenced on Monday to a year in jail for a shooting threat that halted a screening of a damning documentary about the R&B star.
The sentence will not add to the time ex-manager Donnell Russell is already set to serve for a different effort to quash sexual abuse claims against Kelly.
Russell worked with Kelly as the Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling singer was starting to face what would become a tide of accusations, and eventually a sex trafficking conviction. Russell repeatedly sought to suppress the allegations, prosecutors said.
Russell told a judge in New York on Monday that he had “made bad judgments” after starting to work with Kelly on what Russell described as intellectual property matters.
“I’m not a horrible person,” Russell said.
The telephone threat to the theatre came shortly before the scheduled start of a December 2018 Manhattan premiere of Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly series, which spotlighted allegations that Kelly had sexually abused women and girls.
A live panel discussion, including several women featured in the documentary, was to follow the screening.
The phone call claimed that someone at the event had a gun and intended to fire. The screening was cancelled and the theatre evacuated.
In that case, a jury convicted Russell in July of threatening physical harm through interstate communication, while acquitting him of conspiracy.
Russell’s defence argued that there were lots of phone calls to the theatre that day, and that there was not enough evidence to prove he committed a crime.
Video of the Day
Days after the jury verdict, Russell pleaded guilty to an interstate stalking charge involving one of Kelly’s sexual abuse accusers.
A Brooklyn federal judge sentenced Russell last month to 20 months in prison for conduct that included sending threatening messages to the woman and later publishing explicit photos of her online.
Russell (47) is due to turn himself in next year to serve his sentences in both cases simultaneously.
Kelly, meanwhile, was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison in his sex trafficking and racketeering case.",2022-12-21T00:00:00Z,https://www.independent.ie,Independent.ie
R. Kelly Associate Sentenced for Making Shooting Threats to Victims Featured in 'Surviving R. Kelly',"As R. Kelly awaits another sentencing and additional criminal trials in several states, his associates and alleged enablers in his sexual abuse crimes are also being punished. The Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly detailed dozens of co-conspirators who worked alongside Kelly to aid in his abuse and sex trafficking ring of underage girls and young women. Now, two of his former associates have been sentenced for their roles in his crimes.

R. Kelly associated sentenced for making threats
The singer’s ex-manager, Donnell Russell, was previously convicted of trying to suppress the abuse allegations of victims. Prosecutors say Russell tried to intimidate at least one accuser and threatened to sue over the Lifetime series. He took things a step further when he called in the warning that shut down the documentary’s 2018 Manhattan premiere ahead of its showing.
During his recent sentencing, Russell told a federal judge that he “made bad judgments” while briefly working with Kelly, Love B. Scott reports. “I’m not a horrible person,” Russell said.

Regarding the phone call Russell made at the 22018 screening, The phone call claimed that someone at the screening had a gun and would fire. As a result, the screening was canceled, and the theater was evacuated. “I was happy that it ended. I didn’t question how it ended,” Russell said.
Prosecutors were able to link Russell to the phone threat through phone records and a text he sent about police potentially arriving at the venue. His defense team argued that there were many phone calls to the theater and that there wasn’t enough evidence to pin it on him.
He was convicted of threatening physical harm through interstate communication. Russell was not convicted of the conspiracy charge. He pleaded guilty to an interstate stalking charge of one of Kelly’s accusers. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison for the threat, which included making threatening messages to the woman, and later publishing explicit photos of her online as retaliation.
Another associate was found guilty of torching one of R. Kelly’s victim’s cars
Kelly’s former publicist, Michael Williams, pleaded guilty to torching Azriel Clary’s car in 2020. Clary was in a five-year relationship with the singer, beginning when she was just 17. Williams set the car ablaze in an attempt to intimidate Clary out of testifying against Kelly in his Brooklyn criminal trial.
Per Page Six, fire investigators linked Williams to the crime after discovering an accelerant on the edge of Clary’s property. Toll plaza cameras captured Williams’ GMC Yukon, which had severe damage to the front and side of the car and no license plate, traveling from his home state of Georgia to Florida ahead of the fire. The same cameras also captured Williams returning.

Once authorities searched Williams’ home, a complaint reveals he searched the phrases “witness intimidation” and “case law for tampering with a witness” on his devices. Clary also shared a photo and video evidence of the damage to her car on Instagram.
Williams was sentenced to eight years in prison for his part in Kelly’s crimes. His attorney, Todd Spodek, told FOX News that a sentence of five years would have been “sufficient but not greater than necessary in this case.” Now, Spodek says they plan to explore their legal options in Williams’ conviction.
R. Kelly is currently awaiting sentencing in his second criminal case
Kelly is already serving a 30-year sentence after being found guilty of six out of nine counts in his sex trafficking and racketeering case in Brooklyn.

R. Kelly manager gets a year in prison for theater shooting threat,"NEW YORK (AP) — R. Kelly’s onetime manager was sentenced Monday to a year in federal prison for calling in a shooting threat that halted a screening of a damning documentary about the R&B star.
The punishment won’t add to the time ex-manager Donnell Russell is already set to serve for a different effort to squelch sexual abuse claims against Kelly.
Russell told a Manhattan federal judge Monday that he had “made bad judgments” while briefly working with the Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling singer.
“I’m not a horrible person,” Russell said.
Russell said he reconnected with Kelly, a fellow Chicagoan he’d met decades earlier, as the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer was facing a growing series of accusations that eventually fueled Kelly’s sex trafficking and racketeering conviction last year. Russell said he set out to help Kelly with intellectual property matters that he thought could yield the performer money to pay legal bills.
But prosecutors said Russell also worked on something else: trying to suppress the abuse allegations. He tried to intimidate at least one accuser, threatened to sue over Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly” series and eventually phoned in the warning that shut down the documentary’s 2018 Manhattan premiere, according to prosecutors.
The series spotlighted allegations that Kelly had sexually abused women and girls. Some accusers were set to speak at a panel discussion after the premiere.
The phone call claimed that someone at the event had a gun and intended to fire. The screening was canceled and the theater evacuated.
“I was happy that it ended. I didn’t question how it ended,” Russell said in court Monday, adding that he recognizes that people have “a moral obligation” to make sure that things they get involved in are proper.
Prosecutors linked Russell to the episode through phone records and a text he sent about police potentially arriving at the venue. At trial, his defense argued that there were lots of phone calls to the theater that day and that there wasn’t enough evidence to prove he committed a crime.
A jury convicted Russell in July of threatening physical harm through interstate communication, while acquitting him of conspiracy.
Days after the verdict, Russell pleaded guilty to an interstate stalking charge involving one of Kelly’s sexual abuse accusers. A Brooklyn federal judge sentenced Russell last month to 20 months in prison for conduct that included sending threatening messages to the woman and later publishing explicit photos of her online.
Russell, 47, is due to turn himself in next year to serve his sentences in both cases simultaneously.
At Monday’s sentencing, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe said Russell had engaged in “serious criminal conduct” in “a misguided attempt to protect someone who was a prolific abuser.”
Kelly was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison in his sex trafficking and racketeering case in Brooklyn federal court.
In September, a Chicago federal jury convicted him of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex, though jurors cleared him of a charge of rigging his state-level child pornography trial in 2008. He is set to be sentenced Feb. 23 in that case.
Kelly also faces state-level charges in Chicago and in Minnesota related to sexual misconduct allegations. He has pleaded not guilty in Chicago. The singer has yet to be brought to Minnesota’s Hennepin County to answer the charges there, but one of his lawyers called the case “beyond absurd” when it was announced.",2022-12-20T08:55:04Z,https://www.abc4.com,ABC 4

R. Kelly's ex-manager Donnell Russell gets year in prison for theater threat,"His misplaced loyalty is taking him right to prison.
Donnell Russell, former manager to R. Kelly, was sentenced Monday to a year in a federal lockup for calling in a shooting threat to a Manhattan theater that stopped the screening of a damaging documentary about the disgraced hip-hop star.
As a judge handed down the sentence, the Kelly loyalist insisted he’s not a bad person. The sentence won’t add time to the prison time he’s already expected to serve in another federal criminal case against him.
Russell admitted in court he “made bad judgments” when he briefly worked for the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer as Kelly faced growing sexual abuse allegations.
“I’m not a horrible person,” Russell said in court, though US District Judge Paul Gardephe slammed him as someone who took part in “serious criminal conduct” in “a misguided attempt to protect someone who was a prolific abuser.”
Russell, 47, said he originally got involved with the Grammy winner assisting with intellectual property matters to help Kelly pay legal bills. The two Chicago natives had met decades earlier before they reconnected.

Kelly was convicted of sex trafficking and racketeering last year and was sentenced to 30 years in June. Sentencing on his conviction for producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex in Chicago is set for Feb. 23.
Before the guilty verdicts against Kelly, Russell worked to quiet those abuse allegations by threatening at least one accuser — and then phoned in a shooting threat to the Manhattan premiere of Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly” docuseries that shut down the show in 2018.
The phone call claimed someone at the event had a gun and was going to fire, triggering the event’s cancellation and evacuation.
The series focused on accusations against Kelly that he sexually abused women and girls; some of the accusers were scheduled to speak on a panel after the premiere.

“I was happy that it ended. I didn’t question how it ended,” Russell said in court Monday.
Russell was convicted in July for threatening physical harm through interstate communication connected to the theater threat, but was acquitted of conspiracy.
Days after that guilty verdict, he pleaded guilty to interstate stalking involving one of Kelly’s sexual abuse accusers and sentenced to 20 months in prison last month.
He is expected to turn himself in next year to serve the two sentences simultaneously.

R. Kelly former manager gets prison time for theater threat,"A former manager of R. Kelly received a one-year prison sentence Monday for claiming someone would open fire at a New York screening of a documentary about the scandal-scarred singer.
Donnell Russell allegedly made the shooting threat in a phone call to a Manhattan theater in December 2018, causing the audience to evacuate and the screening to be canceled.

In November, Russell was sentenced to 20 months in prison for sending threats to a woman who accused Kelly of sexual abuse. The ex-manager also allegedly posted explicit images of the accuser online.
Monday’s sentence won’t add to the actual time Russell will spend in prison. He’ll serve both sentences concurrently, beginning next year.
Known for hits such as “I Believe I Can Fly” and “Ignition,” Kelly for decades has faced accusations of sexual abuse, including claims involving minors, which he repeatedly denied. The 2019-20 documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly” chronicles allegations against the singer.
Kelly was found guilty in September on three counts of child pornography, as well as three counts of child enticement, in Chicago.
He faces sentencing in the Illinois city in February.

"R Kelly semble avoir furieusement dit aux gens de ""laisser ma musique tranquille"" dans un email envoyé depuis la prison.","Claire Foy a été prévenue qu'un homme condamné pour l'avoir harcelée pourrait encore lui écrire des lettres.
Jason Penrose, 49 ans, originaire des États-Unis, a comparu à la Wood Green Crown Court de Londres jeudi (15.12.22) pour le prononcé de la peine après avoir admis une accusation de harcèlement et deux violations d'une ordonnance de protection contre le harcèlement. Au cours de l'audience, le juge David Aaronberg a prévenu la star de ""The Crown"" que son calvaire pourrait ne pas s'arrêter là.
Il a parlé à la cour d'une lettre prétendument écrite par Penrose et a ajouté : ""Il s'agit de quelqu'un qui démontre dans la lettre qu'il a une sorte d'obsession pour Mme Foy et qu'il est susceptible d'écrire à nouveau à l'occasion, mais promet de ne pas persister à sonner à sa porte. Il ne s'agit en aucun cas d'un document menaçant. Il s'agit de divers gribouillages et divagations sur un morceau de papier déchiré.""
Penrose a nié avoir envoyé la lettre. L'audience de détermination de la peine a été ajournée jusqu'au 20 janvier, le juge ayant déclaré à la cour qu'il devait attendre que le ministère de l'Intérieur lui dise si Penrose serait expulsé vers l'Amérique.
Le juge Aaronberg a ajouté : "" Si la décision est prise de l'expulser, il est probable que je lui inflige une peine avec sursis assortie d'une ordonnance d'interdiction de séjour. Je veux qu'il soit stipulé dans l'ordonnance restrictive qu'il ne peut pas entrer dans le pays.
""S'il arrête de prendre ses médicaments, il va probablement redevenir une peste, mais il ne veut pas être une peste. Je peux voir qu'il a une obsession malsaine pour Mme Foy et qu'il n'arrête pas d'essayer de la contacter.
""Mme Foy veut savoir ce qui va lui arriver. Mais j'ai bien peur d'avoir besoin de quelque chose de plus, soit du ministère de l'Intérieur, soit des médecins.""
Penrose a reçu des soins dans un hôpital de Londres et le juge Aaronberg a confirmé qu'il maintiendrait l'ordonnance de traitement. Il a dit à la cour : ""La seule chose que je puisse raisonnablement faire est de maintenir l'ordonnance que j'ai prise pour qu'il reste à l'hôpital de manière involontaire aux frais du contribuable britannique. Bien que l'on puisse se demander pourquoi cela devrait être le cas alors qu'il est ici illégalement.""
Claire aurait été terrifiée après avoir été bombardée d'e-mails de Penrose, qui se serait également présenté à son domicile, aurait contacté ses amis et ses proches et aurait tenté d'entrer en contact avec l'actrice sur les réseaux sociaux.

‘Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter’ Docuseries Arrives in January,"Following R. Kelly‘s paramount conviction in federal court after decades as a sexual abuser and trafficker, the third installment in Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly documentary series will arrive on Jan. 2-3, as part of a two-night event.
Explore Explore R. Kelly See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news
Titled Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter, the docuseries will feature bombshell revelations from Kelly’s 2021 trial, where he faced charges including racketeering, sexual exploitation of a child, bribery, kidnapping, forced labor and Mann Act Coercion and Enticement. The series will detail the disgraced R&B star’s crimes, which led to his conviction on nine counts and a sentence of 30 years in prison. Interviewees shed light on key moments including Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage’s infamous interviews with Gayle King, as told by Clary’s father, and firsthand accounts of the intimidation tactics used by Kelly and his team surrounding victim testimonies, including setting fire to a Jane Doe’s car with intent to intimidate.
The documentary will also shed light on Kelly’s lesser known victims, including a John Doe, and his relationship with late R&B singer Aaliyah, 12 years his junior. Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter is executive produced by Joel Karsberg, Tamra Simmons, Jesse Daniels, Maria Pepin and Brie Miranda Bryant, and contains over 60 voices and testimonials, including victims, their families, Kelly’s supporters, reporters who attended the trial, among others.
The docuseries trailer shows the chaos that erupted for five weeks outside of the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse, including supporters with microphones yelling “Justice for R. Kelly” day after day, a supporter with Kelly’s name tattooed on her chest, and the influx of press swarming the premises.
During the trial, Kelly’s defense team argued for the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer to receive the minimum sentence of 10 years or less, citing in court documents a “traumatic childhood involving severe, prolonged childhood sexual abuse, poverty, and violence.”
Prosecutors, however, sought a minimum 25-year term. In the end, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years, unintentionally symbolic of the 30 years of abuse he inflicted on countless victims, known and unknown.

R. Kelly's Team Believes Master Recordings Were Stolen,"R Kelly currently sits behind bars for sex crimes, which made it extremely odd to see a new album of his pop up on streaming sites on Friday. An album titled, I Admit It appeared on his Spotify, Apple Music, and TIDAL pages, including unreleased records. His team denied that it was a real release while Sony Music said they were investigating how this dropped on a subsidiary label. However, it seems like his team may have come up with a theory behind the unauthorized release.
According to TMZ, R. Kelly’s team found a theory that could explain the release of I Admit It. Police revealed a man named Keith Calbert called them to report a robbery at Kelly’s warehouse. Calbert oversees R Kelly’s property, and the warehouse storing the master recordings. But in February, Calbert called the police and reported a theft regarding hundreds of missing recordings.

Authorities explained that Calbert informed them of two roadies removing the masters from the warehouse and bringing them to California nine months earlier. Calbert informed the roadies of returning the masters. However, they told him that it costs $160K for them to return these records.
Calbert said he told the roadies to return the masters but ultimately, they placed a $160K price tag to bring them back Despite warning the roadies that the recordings must be returned, the roadies said that needed $160K.
Police revealed that Calbert showed them 10 shelves that were once full and now, completely emptied. Apparently, there are between 300 to 500 recordings that have gone missing.
Kelly’s team reported the stolen property but there’s no reason as to why it took so long. In the meantime, police said that the case is closed since the investigation led to no arrests.
There are still many questions surrounding the release of last week’s I Admit It. His team believe that the two roadies likely have something to do with it.
We’ll continue to keep you posted on any more updates surrounding R. Kelly’s stolen masters.

'Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter' to Air on Lifetime in 2023,"While R. Kelly is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, Lifetime has announced the conclusion of its revelatory docuseries, “Surviving R. Kelly: The Final Chapter.” The two-part special will premiere on Jan. 2 and 3 at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT.
The episodes examine the aftermath of the disgraced R&B singer’s crimes as he faces multiple federal and state trials. “While millions have read the headlines, the final chapter connects the shocking fine print with unspeakable details never shared with the public, culminating in the verdict heard around the world,” the press release reads.
The first night of the special will follow Azriel Clary‘s court testimonial, where she reveals how she was instructed to lie for R. Kelly’s interview with Gayle King and shares details of her abuse on the witness stand. Clary was just 17 years old when she became Kelly’s live-in girlfriend. She and Kelly’s other girlfriend, Joycelyn Savage, often spoke publicly in the singer’s defense, even as accusations of sexual abuse against him multiplied in the wake of the first Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” in 2019. The Clary family will also detail the intimidation tactics used to corner them by R. Kelly supporters while legal experts and journalists provide insight into the racketeering charges against Kelly.
Additionally, the first night of “The Final Chapter” will touch on the aftermath of the gun threat at the 2018 premiere screening of the documentary, for which Kelly’s former manager was convicted. Night two will focus on Jane Doe #1 and, for the first time, a group of John Does who take the stand as new survivors emerge. The series concludes with survivors sharing their victim impact statements as they hear the final verdict against Kelly.
Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June after a jury found him guilty of racketeering related to the sexual exploitation of children, kidnapping and forced labor. Three months ago, a Chicago federal jury found Kelly guilty of six counts of sexual exploitation and enticement of a minor, and he will face sentencing in February. Kelly is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago.

Still little movement in R. Kelly’s Cook County cases,"A courtroom sketch shows defense attorneys Ashley Cohen, from left, and Jennifer Bonjean with singer R. Kelly at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago on Sept. 14, 2022. (Cheryl Cook / Chicago Tribune)
Close observers of R. Kelly’s Cook County cases might have had a touch of deja vu Tuesday during the singer’s latest hearing.
Attorneys noted in court that Kelly’s defense filed a motion months ago to dismiss one of his indictments, and prosecutors had filed a response. Defense attorney Steve Greenberg said he intended to file a similar motion soon on another of Kelly’s cases. Judge Lawrence Flood said it was time to get everything moving toward resolution.

That was strikingly similar to a hearing back in October, at which attorneys mentioned the same pending defense motion and prosecution response, Greenberg said he intended to file a similar motion soon on another of Kelly’s cases, and Flood said he was eager to get everything moving toward resolution.
On Tuesday, however, Flood said next month’s court date would be for arguments on those motions to dismiss – and that Kelly himself, who has been in federal custody for more than a year, should be in attendance.

If that happens it would be the first sign of substantive progress in Kelly’s Cook County cases since federal prosecutors in two states filed double-whammy indictments against the singer in summer 2019. The state cases were quickly overshadowed, and Kelly has since been convicted of federal sex crime-related charges in both Chicago and New York.
Afternoon Briefing Daily Chicago Tribune editors' top story picks, delivered to your inbox each afternoon. >
Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on the New York case; his sentencing in Chicago federal court is set for February.
Meanwhile, he still faces four separate Cook County indictments, in which prosecutors allege he sexually abused or assaulted four people, three of whom were underage girls at the time.
Greenberg months ago filed a formal request to throw out the county case related to Jerhonda Pace, a key witness in the New York federal case. That motion has yet to be argued. Greenberg has also stated he intends to file a similar request on one of the other cases, presumably the indictment centering on some of the same video footage at issue in the Chicago federal case.
Kelly was convicted in Chicago federal court in September on charges including child pornography related to his years of sexual abuse of his underage goddaughter and other girls. He was acquitted, however, of the explosive allegations that he rigged his initial Cook County trial in the 2000s.
Kelly’s 30-year sentence came after a jury in New York found him guilty of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging his musical career doubled as a criminal enterprise aimed at satisfying his predatory sexual desires.

"Album Al Lui R. Kelly, Apărut în Timp Ce Rapperul Este în Pușcărie, Condamnat La 30 De Ani Pentru Abuzuri Sexuale Asupra Minorilor","Artistul din Chicago, al cărui nume real este Robert Sylvester Kelly, este cunoscut pentru hituri precum „I Believe I Can Fly” și „Ignition”.
3 dintre cele 13 melodii de pe noul album par să trateze acuzațiile de care s-a făcut vinovat. În piesa în trei părți „I Admit It”, el spune că „am făcut-o cu câțiva fani” și chiar susține că s-a culcat cu prietena unui amica. Într-un incident din 2017, adjunctul unui șerif din Mississippi a intentat un proces împotriva superstarului R&B , după ce l-ar fi prins în par cu soția.
susține că respectă femeile, dar dă vina pe părinții victimelor sale minore pentru abuz: „Și dacă chiar vrei să știi/ Tatăl ei a lăsat-o la spectacolul meu”.
Casa sa de discuri Sony Music Entertainment a negat că ar fi o lansare autorizată. Unele melodii sunt din 2018, dar au ajuns abia vineri pe Apple Music și Spotify. Ambii furnizori de streaming au eliminat deja albumul.
De altfel, rapperul a fost interzisă de pe Spotify din 2018, când serviciul i-a eliminat muzica după zvonurile că ar fi implicat în molestarea minorilor
Deși R. Kelly a fost deja condamnat la 30 de ani, artistul va fi în curând judecat din nou, în Chicago, fiind acuzat că s-a filmat făcând sex cu mai mulți minori.

R.Kelly singt „Ich gebe es zu“: Neues Album trotz Haft,"Während R. Kelly seine Haft absitzt, ist sein neues Album rausgekommen
Von: Eileen Krämer
Er sitzt hinter Gittern, wird lange nicht rauskommen – seine Musik erblickt aber dennoch das Tageslicht.
Sänger R. Kelly (bürgerlich Robert Kelly, 55) wurde im Juni dieses Jahres wegen Missbrauchs von Minderjährigen zu 30 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt. Und die sitzt er derzeit im Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center ab. Doch das hält den „I Believe I Can Fly“-Interpreten nicht davon ab, neue Musik zu veröffentlichen.
Am Freitag erschien aus dem Nichts ein neues Album mit dem Titel „I Admit It“ (deutsch: „Ich gebe es zu“) auf Spotify und Apple Music.
30 Jahre hat R. Kelly für den Missbrauch an Minderjährigen bekommen – eine der höchsten Haftstrafen, die ein bekannter Sänger jemals erhalten hat
Besonders schockierend: Drei der 13 Songs auf dem Album befassen sich mit den Missbrauchsvorwürfen gegen Kelly. Dabei gesteht er diese auf gewisse Weise, versucht aber, die Schuld von sich zu schieben.
Vor allem im dreiteiligen Song „I Admit It (I Did It)“ verkündet er: „Ich habe mit ein paar Fans gevögelt“. Außerdem lässt er schamlos verlauten, er sei mit der Freundin seiner damaligen Partnerin ins Bett gestiegen.
Trotz der fragwürdigen Texte behauptet R. Kelly dann in einem Stück, er habe nichts als Respekt für Frauen.
Früher wurde er für seine Songs gefeiert – jetzt will sie niemand mehr hören
An einer Stelle des insgesamt 15-minütigen Songs klingt es, als gebe der Sänger den Eltern seiner minderjährigen Opfer die Schuld an den Missbräuchen. „Und wenn ihr es wirklich, wirklich wissen wollt. Ihr Vater hat sie in meiner Show abgesetzt.“
Eine Kaution für R. Kelly wurde vom Gericht abgelehnt
Die Musikwelt reagierte schockiert auf diese Songs. Wer steckt hinter der Veröffentlichung?
Sein Label Sony Music Entertainment lehnte in einer Stellungnahme gegenüber der „New York Post“ ab, dass es sich um ein autorisiertes Release handelt.
Auch interessant Anzeige
Einige Songs stammen aus dem Jahr 2018, landeten aber erst diesen Freitag auf Apple und Spotify. Bereits am Nachmittag hatten beide Streaming-Anbieter das Album wieder entfernt.
Weshalb die Songs in erster Linie überhaupt auf den Streaming-Plattformen zugelassen worden sind, ist unklar. Denn eigentlich hat der Sänger seit 2018 Verbot auf Spotify. Der Dienst entfernte seine Musik damals, als die Gerüchte aufkamen, Kelly betreibe einen Sexkult.
Zwar wurde R. Kelly bereits zu 30 Jahren hinter schwedischen (oder besser US-amerikanischen) Gardinen verurteilt, dennoch steht er bald erneut vor Gericht. Und zwar in Chicago. Grund: Kelly wird beschuldigt, sich beim Sex mit mehreren Minderjährigen auch noch gefilmt zu haben.",2022-12-10T12:57:11Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD

30 Jahre Haft für schwere Sexualverbrechen
Der mit dem Hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"" zum Star gewordene Musiker war im vergangenen Juni von einem Gericht in Brooklyn wegen schwerer Sexualverbrechen zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt worden. Bei einem weiteren Prozess in Chicago wurde der 55-Jährige im September wegen Kinderpornografie schuldig gesprochen, ihm droht dem 55-Jährigen eine weitere lange Gefängnisstrafe.
Erste Anschuldigungen gegen den 1967 in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborenen Musiker wurden bereits vor rund 25 Jahren bekannt. Doch der Musik-Koloss schien unangreifbar auf seinem Pop-Thron und blieb lange Zeit auf freiem Fuß.
Mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben, mehreren Grammys und anderen Auszeichnungen gehörte er zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern des späten 20. Jahrhunderts. Aber spätestens als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation ""Surviving R. Kelly"" die Anschuldigungen zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer. Stars distanzierten sich von ihm, zudem Radiosender, Streaming-Dienste und dann auch sein Musiklabel RCA, das zu Sony Music gehört.",2022-12-10T11:46:56Z,https://www.n-tv.de,n-tv NACHRICHTEN

Álbum pirata de R. Kelly esteve disponível online brevemente,"Um álbum pirata do cantor R. Kelly, condenado a 30 anos de prisão por crimes sexuais contra adolescentes e considerado culpado de pornografia infantil, esteve disponível online brevemente na sexta-feira (9) nas plataformas Spotify e Apple Music.
O site TMZ foi o primeiro a reportar que o álbum ""I Admit It"", de Robert Sylvester Kelly, de 55 anos, e que está preso em Nova York, tinha sido disponibilizado online.
A Spotify não respondeu aos pedidos de informações da AFP, mas algumas horas depois do artigo do TMZ e de outro na Hollywood Reporter, o álbum não estava mais disponível em nenhuma das duas plataformas de música em streaming.
Um representante da Sony Music, dona dos direitos de R. Kelly, consultado pela revista Variety, disse que o álbum que foi disponibilizado na internet era uma gravação ""pirata"".
Jennifer Bonjean, advogada do cantor, também disse à Variety que nem o artista, nem seu entorno estavam por trás deste fato e que seu cliente teve ""roubada a propriedade intelectual"".
R. Kelly, conhecido pelo hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"" e seus 75 milhões de álbuns vendidos, foi condenado em setembro de 2021, em Nova York, por ter chefiado por três décadas um ""sistema"" de exploração sexual que incluía adolescentes. Por estes crimes, o tribunal federal do Brooklyn lhe impôs uma pena de 30 anos de prisão.
Também em setembro, um tribunal de Chicago (Illinois) o considerou culpado de produzir pornografia e praticar abuso infantil. Por isso, poderia ser condenado a uma pena de ""10 a 90 anos de prisão"", segundo o procurador federal de Illinois.
Os julgamentos contra R. Kelly são considerados uma etapa maior do movimento #MeToo, ao ser a primeira vez que a maioria das denunciantes é de mulheres negras que acusam um artista negro, alcançando justiça.
Por décadas, o sucesso de R. Kelly foi ofuscado por suspeitas e boatos persistentes de violência sexual, que o artista conseguiu calar por muito tempo, mediante acordos financeiros com cláusulas de confidencialidade.

Un album du chanteur pédocriminel R. Kelly brièvement mis en ligne,"(New York) R. Kelly, artiste déchu du R & B condamné à 30 ans de prison pour des crimes sexuels sur des adolescentes et coupable de pédopornographie, a vu vendredi sortir un album inédit, alors qu’il est incarcéré, sur les plateformes Spotify et Apple Music, disque que la presse spécialisée a qualifié d’enregistrement pirate.
Agence France-Presse
C’est le média TMZ qui, le premier, a affirmé que Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 ans, emprisonné à New York, avait mis en ligne l’album I Admit It — 13 titres dont le morceau éponyme de 19 minutes déjà publié en 2018 sur SoundCloud.
Spotify n’a pas répondu aux sollicitations de l’AFP et, quelques heures après l’article de TMZ ainsi qu’un autre de Hollywood Reporter, le disque n’était plus disponible sur aucune des deux plateformes de musique en ligne, a-t-on constaté.
Un représentant du propriétaire des droits de R. Kelly Sony Music, interrogé par le média Variety, a assuré que cet album brièvement disponible sur les plateformes avait été rendu public de manière officieuse, c’est-à-dire selon Variety qu’il s’agissait d’un enregistrement « pirate » sorti sous le manteau.
Une avocate de R. Kelly, Jennifer Bonjean, a d’ailleurs affirmé, toujours auprès de Variety, que ni le chanteur ni son entourage n’étaient derrière cet évènement, et que son client s’était « fait dérober sa propriété intellectuelle ».
Le chanteur, mondialement connu pour son succès I Believe I Can Fly et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, avait été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 à New York d’avoir piloté pendant trois décennies un « système » d’exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes. Pour ces crimes sexuels, le tribunal fédéral de Brooklyn l’avait condamné à 30 ans de réclusion.
Et en septembre dernier, un tribunal de Chicago (Illinois) l’a reconnu coupable de production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur. Il pourrait être condamné à une peine de « 10 à 90 années de prison », selon le procureur fédéral de l’Illinois.
Les procès contre R. Kelly sont considérés comme une étape majeure du mouvement #metoo : c’est la première fois que la majorité des plaignantes sont des femmes noires accusant un artiste noir et obtenant justice.
Pendant des décennies, le succès de R. Kelly avait été terni par des soupçons de violences sexuelles, objets de rumeurs persistantes.

La Ribot, installée depuis le début des années 2000 à Genève, rentre de Louvain. La rencontre avec Keystone-ATS, quelques jours avant le début du spectacle ""DIEstinguished"", se déroule dans une loge de la Comédie de Genève où la chorégraphe s'est installée sur un canapé orange.
""Delphine Lehericey a saisi un point de vue sur la danse contemporaine que j'ai beaucoup apprécié: drôle, beau et poétique, explique l'artiste. La danse contemporaine n'est pas une forme extérieure qui s'ancre dans le corps: c'est plutôt un besoin d'expression qui vient de l'intérieur"".
Si c'est la première fois que La Ribot jouait sur grand écran dans ""Last Dance"", la chorégraphe, dont la démarche imbrique danse et art contemporain, a intégré la recherche vidéo à son travail depuis longtemps. Pour ""DIEstinguished"", les danseurs porteront des caméras ""comme des extensions de leur corps"" et produiront des images que les spectateurs pourront suivre sur leur téléphone portable. ""J'essaie de rendre l'expérience de la danse accessible"".
Le projet de toute une vie
La Ribot a lancé son projet des ""Pièces distinguées"" il y a 30 ans en 1993. ""C'est un projet de toute une vie"", explique-t-elle dans un français qui flirte avec l'espagnol. Elle a décidé arbitrairement qu'elle créerait 100 performances courtes en direct: ""c'était une façon de se projeter dans l'avenir"".
La 58e Pièce distinguée, qu'elle propose à Genève, est ""une exception car elle dure plus d'une heure"". Pour ce spectacle, elle a beaucoup travaillé sur deux concepts, ceux de la transformation permanente et de la saturation.
Arrivera-t-elle au bout de son projet de créer 100 pièces? ""Pour moi, DIEstinguished - dont le titre contient le mot ""die"" (mourir) -, c'est la dernière de la série. Je crois que je vais arrêter. Mais ce n'est sans doute pas vrai et probablement que je continuerais"",
Actuellement, il existe 58 Pièces distinguées regroupées en 7 séries ou spectacles, soit environ neuf heures si elles étaient mises bout à bout.
Le corps comme une toile
Jouant avec la nudité dès ses débuts, elle utilise le corps comme ""une toile sur laquelle je peux dessiner, attacher, coller. Je travaille beaucoup avec l'aspect 'art visuel' de la danse. C'est peut-être par là que les Pièces distinguées ont changé ou proposé une façon différente de voir la danse contemporaine.""
Car avec ce projet fou et sa démarche artistique, la chorégraphe est déjà entrée dans l'histoire de la danse contemporaine. ""La Ribot fait le lien entre la performance et le 'live art'"", peut-on lire dans le livre ""Danse et contemporain"" de Rosita Boisseau et Christian Fattinoni. Et l'artiste a déjà reçu les plus hautes distinctions comme le Lion d'Or de la Biennale de Venise en 2020 pour l'ensemble de son oeuvre après le Grand Prix de la danse en Suisse l'année précédente.
D'une certaine manière, La Ribot a donné un côté plus accessible à la danse contemporaine. Elle travaille souvent avec des personnes qui ne sont pas des danseurs. ""Les corps autres que ceux des danseurs m'ont toujours beaucoup intéressés"". Elle aime voir comment la danse naît dans la tête et dans les corps des danseurs amateurs.
La Ribot travaille encore avec des danseurs professionnels en situation de handicap : elle a monté en 2018 le spectacle ""Happy Island"" avec les danseurs de la compagnie Dançando com a Diferença, basée sur l'île de Madère.
Un milieu en pleine effervescence
Comment juge-t-elle la vitalité de la danse contemporaine? ""Ce milieu est en pleine effervescence, estime-t-elle. La danse apparaît dans des lieux ou des médias où elle n'avait pas ses entrées auparavant.""
Et elle cite un ami, l'ancien directeur du musée de la mode à Paris Olivier Saillard: ""C'est une discipline de transmission, de la connaissance et de la pratique. La danse ne peut pas se vendre parce qu'on ne peut pas la matérialiser.""
A la Comédie de Genève du 9 au 11 décembre, les Romands pourront encore voir ""DIEstinguished"" au Théâtre Vidy-Lausanne du 20 au 22 janvier et au Théâtre Les Halles Sierre les 3 et 4 mars. La première a eu lieu au Théâtre populaire romand (TPR) à La Chaux-de-Fonds fin septembre, en co-accueil avec ADN - Danse Neuchâtel. Ce spectacle est également lauréat du concours Label+ romand - arts de la scène 2020.

R. Kelly New Album Released on Streaming: How Did It Get There?,"A new R. Kelly album titled I Admit It was uploaded to streaming services Friday (Dec. 9), but it didn’t come from Kelly’s team or his label.
While the release credits Sony Music’s Legacy Recordings as the label, a rep for Legacy Recordings said the company was not involved in the project. Furthermore, sources at Legacy say the album came as a total surprise and they are inquiring with streamers such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music how the album was delivered to them.
Instead, the album was uploaded by Universal Music Group-owned distributor Ingrooves, leaving involved parties scrambling to figure out what went wrong. Once Ingrooves executives learned of the release, according to a source familiar with the situation, they set about action to have streaming services pull the release. By 3 p.m. EST it was down on Friday.

Now, the source says, Ingrooves is in the process of investigating what went wrong internally and is severing a relationship with the label Real Talk Entertainment, which released the album on a sub-label called Legacy Recordings — the same name as Sony’s imprint. Real Talk could not be reached for immediate comment.
In January 2019, Sony and Kelly agreed to part ways days after Lifetime released the Surviving R. Kelly documentary that detailed the sexual misconduct allegations against the three-time Grammy-winning singer. Sony still represents Kelly’s catalog of music, however, including his early recordings under Zomba/Jive and then later RCA, both of which are Sony-owned imprints.
The 13-track project arrives as the disgraced R&B singer (real name Robert Sylvester Kelly) is serving a a 30 prison sentence after he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking charges in a New York trial last June. In September, during his another trial in his hometown of Chicago, Kelly, 55, was convicted of several child pornography charges.
The album’s title track, “I Admit It,” was originally released as a 19-minute track on SoundCloud in 2018 and is now featured as three separate songs, each titled “I Admit It (I Did It),” at the end of the album that addresses the sexual abuse allegations against him over the last few decades and its virulent effects on his career.
Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, did not respond to Billboard‘s request for comment at time of publishing. But she told Variety earlier Friday that the singer’s team is not behind the release and that he “is having intellectual property stolen from him.”
The last studio album Kelly released was a holiday album titled 12 Nights of Christmas on Oct. 21, 2016. It’s his final album on RCA Records before the label removed him following the wake of the Surviving R. Kelly doc.

R. Kelly Blasted for Bootleg Album Drop: 'Most Shameless Thing Since O.J.',"Many were shocked and appalled on Friday following the news that disgraced R&B superstar R. Kelly has dropped a bootleg new album—while behind bars.
Kelly, whose name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was found guilty in September of multiple child porn-related charges in a Chicago federal trial. Separately, he received a 30-year sentence in June after jurors found him guilty on nine counts of sex trafficking and racketeering.
Kelly's 13-track LP is reportedly titled I Admit It, but Sony Music has insisted that the new offering is an unofficial release.
The embattled singer's name began to trend on Twitter on Friday when many social media users expressed dismay at the news.
""R Kelly dropping this album from PRISON is the most shameless thing I've seen since OJ wrote the book about killing his wife,"" Bleacher Report journalist Tyler Conway tweeted.

Convicted predator R. Kelly album 'I Admit It' leaked,"R. Kelly may not be released, but his album is.
The fraught rapper seemingly came out with a new album on Friday, titled “I Admit It,” while he was still incarcerated for federal sex crimes — although it’s unclear who is actually behind the release.
Sony Music Entertainment’s Legacy Recordings declined to comment when contacted by The Post; however, an insider said that it was not a release from the label. TMZ similarly reported that a Sony Music source said it appears to be a “bootleg” album.
Some of the tunes date back to 2018 but appear to be only released on Apple and Spotify on Friday.
It’s still unclear who dropped the album and how, but the new release is going viral for including three tracks addressing the years of allegations levied against the 55-year-old convicted sex offender. The “I Believe I Can Fly” singer — whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly — is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence for sex trafficking after getting convicted last year in New York of sexually abusing women, girls and boys for decades.
On the album, R, Kelly appears to come clean about some of his scandalous behavior, most notably on the multi-part song “I Admit It (I Did It),” in which he proclaims, “I done f–ked with a couple of fans” — and even claims he slept with his girlfriend’s friend. In an infamous incident in 2017, a Mississippi sheriff’s deputy filed a lawsuit against the R&B superstar for allegedly bedding his wife and giving her chlamydia.
R. Kelly’s alleged new album, “I Admit It,” addresses allegations levied at him over the years.
Despite apparently airing his own dirty laundry, R. Kelly maintains that he still respects women on the track.
“How they gon’ say I don’t respect these women when all I’ve done is represent,” he raps, adding that the public is “mad I’ve got some girlfriends.”
At one point three-part, 15-minute song, the rapper even appears to blame the parents of his victims for introducing them: “And if you really, really wanna know. Her father dropped her off at my show. And told this boy to put her on the stage. I admit that she was overage.”

It’s unclear why Kelly was allowed back on Spotify, which stopped promoting the lyricist’s music back in 2018 amid allegations that he was running a sex cult.
Kelly is currently housed at the Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate database. He is also on trial in Chicago in a separate case accusing him of videotaping himself having sex with multiple children, luring children for sex and rigging his 2008 pornography trial.",2022-12-09T19:40:32Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
R Kelly’s ‘I Admit It’ Album Seems To reference Sex Trafficking,"R. Kelly appeared to make a reference to his accusers and the sex trafficking charges that he was arrested for with the closing title track for his new album I Admit It. The singer, 55, included a three-part closer, which clocks in at around 18 minutes total, where he confesses to a number of faults, and he seemed to reference the sexual misconduct allegations that had been brought against him by multiple women.
On the track, Kelly admits to many faults, including cheating on partners and that he’d been a victim of sexual abuse himself, but certain lines appear to reference the incidents of abuse that he was charged with. “I done f**ked with a couple of fans,” he sings in the first verse, via Genius.
Besides the line about having relations with fans, he also claps back at his accusers and the coverage surrounding him, and he denies having done anything criminal. “You mad I’ve got some girlfriends,” he sings at one point. He also references his trial, where he was later found guilty. “They tryna lock me up like Bill,” he says, seemingly referring to Bill Cosby. He also denied having sexual relationships with underage girls.
“I Admit It” was first released in whole on SoundCloud in July 2018, months after the BBC documentary R. Kelly: Sex, Girls And Videotapes had aired. The track dropped almost exactly one year after journalist Jim DeRogatis published a lengthy report on Buzzfeed that three sets of parents had alleged that Kelly had held their daughters in an “abusive cult.” Kelly named Rogatis in the track and said he had been trying to “destroy me for 25 whole years,” referring to Rogatis’ coverage of him, dating back as far as 2000.
It’s not clear how exactly Kelly’s new album was released on streaming services. The copyright is listed as Legacy Recordings, which is owned by Sony Music, on Apple Music and Spotify. Kelly was dropped by Sony in 2019 after many allegations came out against him. A representative for the company explained that the version of I Admit It appearing on streaming is a bootleg and that it was not an official Legacy Recordings release, according to Variety.
R. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison for sex abuse and racketeering in June, after being found guilty in a New York court in September of 2021. He was found guilty of three counts of child pornography in a Chicago court in September and is expected to be sentenced in 2023.",2022-12-09T19:31:32Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
"R. Kelly calls new 'I Admit It' album not his, denies involvement","R. Kelly calls new 'I Admit It' album not his, denies involvement
R. Kelly says not behind the new album I Admit It, which surfaced on streaming services on Friday.
As per TMZ, the convicted sexual abuser denied any part in the track’s release, calling it a plot to undermine him in court.
The disgraced singer rejected any recent music release, saying he is set to appeal his recent federal conviction. He added he hoped people recognized his voice and “know that.”
Jennifer Bonjean, Kelly's attorney, told Variety that the singer's team did not release any music and that he “is having intellectual property stolen from him.”
Sony Music, which owns rights to most of Kelly’s music, also stated that the release did not come from them.
However, Sony Music’s Legacy Recordings is labeled in the release credits. Still, sources close to the label ruled out company involvement with Billboard. They said the investigation is underway on the album delivered to streamers, including Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon.

Sony Rep Calls New R. Kelly Album Fake,"A judge locked R Kelly up for the indefinite future but a new album appeared this morning on his streaming pages. Following a jury’s decision to convict him of federal sex crimes, an album titled, I Admit It appeared on his streaming pages. The project contains no features 13 songs in total with no features.
Though many believed this is an official release from R Kelly’s catalog, a rep for Sony Music said it was a bootleg. In a statement to Variety, a rep for Kelly said that it’s an unofficial album.
Sony currently owns the rights to Kelly’s catalog. While the copyright line says the project dropped under Sony Music’s division Legacy Records, the rep said that I Admit It is not an official release.

The album features titles like “Freaky Sensation” and “The Last Man Standing.” Some of the songs on the album surfaced online over the past few years. Many of the songs appeared online before the fake album popped up. In the case of some of the records, they also appear to come out of his vault.
The project closes out with “I Admit It,” a three-part record dissecting the allegations against him. “I Admit It” dropped on Soundcloud in 2018 as a 19-minute effort but this marks the first time it became available on DSPs.
Kelly initially dropped the song in 2018 on Soundcloud. However, it appears online as a three-part record that concludes I Admit It. This marks the first time the song became available on streaming services like Apple and Spotify.
The song directly responds to the allegations made against R. Kelly over the years. He admits he “done fucked with a couple of fans,” adding that people’s outrage spawned from the fact that he has “some girlfriends.” Additionally, he sparks on rumors that he kidnapped women, singing, “They’re brainwashed, really? Kidnapped, really? Can’t eat, really? Real talk, that s*** sound silly.”
R. Kelly is currently behind bars after he was convicted of federal sex crimes. In September, a jury found him guilty of six out of thirteen charges in his child pornography case in Chicago. The court convicted R. Kelly of three counts of child pornography, and three counts of enticing minors for sex. These charges are related to his infamous acquittal in 2008.

R. Kelly Bootleg Album ‘I Admit It’ Released And Quickly Removed,"Topline
Spotify and Apple Music removed a bootleg R. Kelly album called “I Admit It” within hours of its surprise release on Friday—five months after the disgraced R&B singer was sentenced to three decades in prison in July on trafficking and racketeering charges.

Key Facts
The provocatively titled album “I Admit It” appeared briefly on Apple Music and Spotify on Friday, although Sony Music representatives told Variety the album was an unofficial bootleg release. Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, who represents Kelly, did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Forbes, although she told Variety that Kelly was not behind the release, but rather had “intellectual property stolen from him.”
Key Background
Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was sentenced in July to 30 years in prison after he was convicted of eight counts of trafficking women across state lines and one count of racketeering. Specifically, he was found guilty of violating the federal Mann Act, an anti-trafficking law that criminalizes the taking of people across state lines for the purpose of “prostitution or debauchery.” Allegations against the beleaguered singer have been swirling for the majority of Kelly’s career, beginning in the 1990s, when he married late singer Aaliyah, who was 15 at the time. In 1996, his ex-wife Tiffany Hawkins accused him of having sex with her five years earlier when he was 24 and she was 15—Kelly settled the suit for $250,000. He was charged with 21 counts of child pornography in 2002, but was acquitted of all charges six years later. He was charged in 2019 with 18 counts including distributing child pornography and kidnapping women—to which he pleaded not guilty.
Surprising Fact
R. Kelly’s popularity had surged in the weeks following his guilty verdict last September on sex trafficking and racketeering charges, with both radio plays increasing by 55% and streams increasing by 14%, according to data provided to Billboard. Album sales also soared 517% while video streams jumped 23% in a one-week stretch after he pleaded guilty, Rolling Stone reported.
Chief Critic
While Kelly’s songs have seen increases in streams, streaming services including Apple Music and Spotify have “muted” his catalog, in accordance with their policies on public hate content—removing Kelly’s music from their promoted playlists, although his music remains on the platforms.
Big Number
4.37 million. That’s how many monthly listeners Kelly has on Spotify, according to the platform.

O καταδικασμένος για σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα R. Kelly κυκλοφόρησε νέο άλμπουμ,"Ο R. Kelly μόλις κυκλοφόρησε άλμπουμ με τίτλο «I Admit It» με στίχους που αφορούν τις κατηγορίες που διατυπώνονται εναντίον του για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση ανηλίκων.
Το άλμπουμ με τα 13 τραγούδια περιλαμβάνει κομμάτια με τίτλους όπως «I Found Love», «Good Ole Days» και «Freaky Sensation». Αλλά τα 3 τελευταία κομμάτια του ίσως να είναι τα πιο αποκαλυπτικά - πρόκειται για ένα 3μερές κομμάτι με τίτλο ""I Admit it (I Did It)"", όπου ξεφορτώνεται έναν τόνο από πράγματα που έχει κάνει στο παρελθόν. Έβαλε ολόκληρο το 19λεπτο κομμάτι στο SoundCloud πίσω στο 2018, αλλά αυτή είναι η πρώτη φορά που φτάνει στην Apple ή στο Spotify.
Τον περασμένο Ιούνιο, ο R. Kelly καταδικάστηκε σε φυλάκιση 30 ετών αφότου ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο της Νέας Υόρκης τον έκρινε ένοχο για εκβιασμούς, σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση και εξώθηση στην πορνεία. Αυτή η δίκη ενίσχυσε τις κατηγορίες που βαρύνουν εδώ και δύο δεκαετίες τον τραγουδιστή της βραβευμένης με Grammy επιτυχίας «I Believe I Can Fly».
Η ομοσπονδιακή εισαγγελία είχε ζητήσει να του επιβληθεί ποινή κάθειρξης τουλάχιστον 25 ετών λόγω του «κινδύνου» που συνιστά ο Ρόμπερτ Κέλι, όπως είναι το πραγματικό όνομα του τραγουδιστή, για τα θύματά του και για την κοινή γνώμη. Υποστήριξε μάλιστα ότι πρόκειται για ένα «χειριστικό πρόσωπο που δεν έδειξε καμία μεταμέλεια και κανέναν σεβασμό για τον νόμο».
Στις έξι εβδομάδες της δίκης του, το περασμένο καλοκαίρι, κατέθεσαν εννέα γυναίκες και δύο άνδρες που τον κατηγόρησαν ότι τους κακοποίησε σεξουαλικά και περιέγραψαν τους βιασμούς, ενώ υποστήριξαν ότι τους εξανάγκαζε να παίρνουν ναρκωτικά και τους κρατούσε αιχμάλωτους. Ο Κέλι, που από την πλευρά του υποστήριζε ότι είχε πέσει θύμα βιασμού όταν ήταν οκτώ ετών, κρίθηκε ένοχος για όλες τις κατηγορίες: εκβιασμό, σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση ανηλίκου, απαγωγή, διακίνηση ανθρώπων, καταναγκαστική εργασία.
Ο Κέλι αντιμετωπίζει επίσης κατηγορίες για ανάλογες υποθέσεις στο Ιλινόι και στη Μινεσότα.

Murkowski defeats Trump-backed challenger in Alaska Senate race,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is projected to win her bid for reelection to the U.S. Senate, defeating fellow Republican Kelly Tshibaka.
The Associated Press called the race just after 8 p.m.
Murkowski, who has served in the upper chamber since 2002, drew the ire of former President Trump after voting to convict him in his second impeachment trial. Trump subsequently backed Tschibaka in an effort to oust the incumbent.
The results of the race took weeks to be announced due to Alaska’s newly introduced ranked-choice voting system, in which voters rank their candidates by preference.
Under the new system, a candidate wins outright in the first round of voting if he or she gets over 50 percent of the vote. If no candidate does, a second round takes places, in which the candidate that received the fewest votes is eliminated. For those that voted for the eliminated candidate, their vote is then redistributed to their next choice for the seat.
The process continues until one candidate breaks 50 percent of the vote.",2022-11-24T01:10:22Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
Kelly Rowland Defends Chris Brown Amid Boos at 2022 AMAs,"Singer and actor Kelly Rowland took the stage at the 2022 American Music Awards to present the award for Favorite Male R&B Artist.

Chris Brown won Favorite Male R&B Artist at the 2022 AMAs
Prior to the 2022 American Music Awards, Chris Brown (along with singer Ciara) had been tapped to perform a special tribute to Michael Jackson during the show. Over the years, some have drawn comparisons between the two artists for their dance and vocal abilities. However, the AMAs scrapped the performance at the last minute.
“Live shows change all the time, it’s the nature of this business; unfortunately, this element of the AMAs didn’t come together as we couldn’t align on the performance, to no fault of Chris Brown,” a statement from Dick Clark Productions, the company behind the award show, read.
Brown was nominated at the 2022 AMAs for Favorite Male R&B Artist alongside Brent Faiyaz, Givēon, Lucky Daye, and The Weeknd. Brown ultimately came out on top.

Kelly Rowland quieted the audience and defended Chris Brown after a negative reaction
When Rowland announced Chris Brown as the winner for Favorite Male R&B Artist, the audience at Los Angeles’ Microsoft Theater reacted with jeers instead of cheers. After his Michael Jackson tribute was scrubbed, Brown didn’t show up at the ceremony at all, leaving Rowland to accept the award for him while simultaneously trying to calm down the crowd.
“Chris Brown is not here tonight so I’m accepting this award on his behalf,” she said.
“Excuse me — chill out,” she continued while holding up a finger as the crowd continued to boo. “But I wanted to tell Chris, thank you so much for making great R&B music. And I want to tell him thank you for being an incredible performer. I’ll take this award [and] bring it to you. I love you. Congratulations. And congratulations to all the nominees in this category.”
Chris Brown’s career in 2022
Despite his status as a controversial figure in music, Chris Brown has continued to release music over the years, with his most recent project being his album Breezy, released in June 2022. The album features appearances from artists like Lil Durk, Fivio Foreign, Lil Wayne, Lil Baby, Wizkid, H.E.R., Bryson Tiller, Ella Mai, Jack Harlow, and Tory Lanez.
With five songs from Breezy charting on the Billboard Hot 100 during its debut week, Chris Brown surpassed Elvis Presley as the eighth artist in history with the most entries on the Hot 100 chart, with a total of 112.
Breezy is nominated for Best R&B Album at the 2023 Grammy Awards, competing with Mary J. Blige’s Good Morning Gorgeous, Robert Glasper’s Black Radio III, Lucky Daye’s Candydrip, and PJ Morton’s Watch the Sun. Brown previously won Best R&B Album in 2012 for his album F.A.M.E.

R. Kelly Files To Overturn Conviction,"The law caught up to R Kelly in the past few years but his team isn’t giving up. However, the singer is now reportedly looking to overturn his conviction for sex crimes and child pornography.
According to the Chicago Tribune, the embattled singer’s legal team filed two motions in court. The hope is that he’ll land a new court date or reverse his previous convictions for sex crimes.

R. Kelly’s lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, filed motions to U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber, who will hear her arguments on Tuesday. In the motion, she said that the judge should acquit the convictions on grounds of “several technical factors, including that prosecutors did not prove that the alleged sex tape of Kelly abusing ‘Jane’ at his home was made for the ‘purpose’ of producing child pornography.”
Bonjean also took aim at the evidence during the case. She said it was insufficient in proving that the sex tape crossed state lines. Additionally, she said the prosecution failed to show that R Kelly “coerced” underage girls into performing sex acts on him.
Bonjean also contended that an expert witness, Dr. Darrel Turner, made false statements.
“Had the jurors known that Dr. Turner actively misled them, the jurors would likely have rejected his testimony outright,” Bonjean said additionally.
Following the hearings, the court convicted Kelly of racketeering and sex crimes in September 2021. In June, he was then sentenced to 30 years in prison. Federal prosecutors said that he used his fame as a means of coercing underage women to sleeping with him.
“He committed these crimes using his fame and stardom as both a shield, which prevented close scrutiny or condemnation of his actions,” federal prosecutors said. “And a sword, which gave him access to wealth and a network of enablers to facilitate his crimes, and an adoring fan base from which to cull his victims.”

Chris Brown Defended By Kelly Rowland,"The negative narrative following Chris Brown is something that he just can’t shake off. However, Kelly Rowland clearly isn’t allowing anyone to disrespect his name.
Chris Brown hardly appears at award shows these days but his presence can’t be ignored. Last night, the AMAs honored him with the Favorite Male R&B artist. But, he wasn’t present to accept the award and many attendees weren’t necessarily happy to hear his name.

Kelly Rowland defended the singer’s name when she accepted the AMA on his behalf. As the audience’s boos overpowered her speech, she checked the crowd mid-speech.
“Chris Brown isn’t here tonight so I’m accepting this award on his behalf. Excuse me,” she said, raising her index finger at the crowd. “Chill out.”

The crowd settled immediately afterward, eventually leading to cheers once Rowland finished her speech.
The award show allegedly pulled Chris Brown’s performance at the last minute. Over the weekend, he said that the AMAs canceled his tribute to Michael Jackson, along with a performance of “Under The Influence.” He shared footage of his rehearsals, writing “WOULDVE been the ama performance but they cancelled me for reasons unknown.”
The decision caused an uproar among fans. However, The Game felt as if hip-hop and R&B, as a whole, should’ve stood by the R&B singer instead of attending the event.
“When they pulled @chrisbrownofficial’s performance from the AMA’s, all hip hop & R&B artists should’ve declined to,” he wrote. “But we’ll never be that unified & that’s why they keep & will always use us, suck the culture dry & disrespect us in our faces & behind our backs.”
Though the AMAs didn’t honor Chris Brown, he did receive a nomination for Best R&B album for Breezy at the Grammys. Perhaps, this could lead to a performance at the 2023 ceremony.
At this point, the AMAs have not provided details surrounding their decision to pull Chris Brown’s performance. However, he’s clearly keeping things moving.
Just before the Thanksgiving weekend, Chris Brown shared two new singles to celebrate the holiday season, “It’s Giving Christmas” and “No Time Like Christmas.”",2022-11-21T16:13:37Z,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com,HotNewHipHop

The mention of R&B singer Chris Brown caused a brief eruption of boos from the audience at the American Music Awards last night.
Destiny's Child star Kelly Rowland was collecting Brown's award for Favourite Male R&B Artist in his absence when she told the audience: ""Excuse me, chill out"" as she raised a gloved finger for some hush.
It was unclear as to whether the short bout of unsettled, negative murmurs was in relation to the singer himself or his absence from the event, reportedly due to the AMAs cancelling his planned performance at the last minute.
The 33-year-old singer, who was convicted of assaulting former partner and pop star Rihanna in 2009, has not performed at an awards show since the BET Awards in 2017.
He has previously complained of effectively being 'shadow-banned' from awards show performances in the wake of the #MeToo era.

What's been said?
As has been widely reported by US media, Brown was set to perform a medley of Michael Jackson hits at the annual awards show.
But, according to industry website Puck, senior executives at the Disney-owned network ABC had second thoughts.
According to the publication, they were concerned about the optics of Brown – who has had further run-ins with the law since 2009 – performing songs by the late Jackson, who has had serious allegations of child abuse levelled at him since the early nineties.
Last week, Brown shared a 7-minute video of him rehearsing the planned performance with back-up dancers, which began with one of his own tracks followed by Jackson classics Beat It, Wanna Be Starting Something, Billie Jean and Thriller.
In the filmed clip, shared with the caption 'U SERIOUS?' by the singer on Instagram followed by a facepalm emoji, the dance medley looks polished and well rehearsed.
Puck journalist Matthew Belloni, a former editor of The Hollywood Reporter, claimed that while several ABC execs ""felt strongly"" about giving Brown the opportunity to perform, their original plan later hit the skids due to the pairing of Brown and Jackson being considered ""radioactive and thus a nonstarter"".
“Live shows change all the time, it’s the nature of this business,” a Disney representative said in a statement to the website.
“Unfortunately, this element of the AMAs didn’t come together as we couldn’t align on the performance, to no fault of Chris Brown.”
Network ABC, who air the American Music Awards show in the US, are yet to comment.

Kelly Rowland quieted unrest from the audience after Chris Brown’s American Music Award win was booed on Sunday.
The former Destiny’s Child member announced that Brown was the winner of the Favorite Male R&B Artist category, noting that the 33-year-old was not there to receive the trophy — but she would accept it on his behalf.
“Excuse me,” Rowland, 41, said amid boos from the crowd. “Chill out.”
The “Dilemma” singer called Brown an “incredible performer” and went on to speak directly to him.
“Chris, thank you so much for making great R&B music,” the actress concluded. “ll take this award [and] bring it to you. I love you. Congratulations, and congratulations to all the nominees in this category.”

Social media users had mixed feelings about Rowland’s defense of Brown, who has repeatedly been accused of violence against women.
“Why was Kelly Rowland going so hard for Chris brown on that stage?” one viewer asked via Twitter, with another writing, “What the f–k is Chris brown doing still winning awards and why is Kelly Rowland up there thanking his ass wtf truly.”
A third, however, shared their gratitude, adding, “Thank you Kelly Rowland for that genuine love you just showed Chris Brown for winning.”
The dancer claimed on Saturday that he was supposed to perform a Michael Jackson tribute at the 50th annual awards show.

“U SERIOUS?” Brown told his Instagram followers over the weekend, sharing footage from what appeared to be a rehearsal. “WOULDVE been the ama performance but they cancelled me for reasons unknown.”
The show’s producers have yet to address the performance’s seemingly sudden cancellation.
The songwriter has found himself under fire many times since assaulting Rihanna in 2009, from being accused of hitting a woman in 2021 — an investigation that was later dropped due “insufficient evidence” — to being sued for allegedly drugging and raping a woman in 2020.

Brown denied both of the allegations against him, posting on Instagram during the 2020 accusation, “Whenever I’m releasing music or projects, ‘THEY’ try to pull some real bulls–t.”
Brown also made headlines for alleged altercations with his ex-girlfriend Karreuche Tran, who made an appearance as a presenter during Sunday’s show.
The on-again, off-again couple dated from 2010 to 2015, with Tran claiming in 2017 that Brown punched her in the stomach and pushed her down a set of stairs.
The actress subsequently obtained a five-year restraining order against her ex.
Brown denied her allegations at the time and said she “doesn’t need a restraining order” and accused her of trying to “promote something.”",2022-11-21T04:12:06Z,https://pagesix.com,Page Six

Murkowski trolls Alaska Senate challenger as she takes lead in first-place votes,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) trolled her Republican opponent Kelly Tshibaka after she took a lead in the first-place votes for the state’s Senate race.
Alaska’s ranked-choice voting system means voters ranked the candidates from first place to last. A candidate must win a majority of first-place votes to win outright without additional rounds being needed.
No candidate is projected to win a majority of first-place votes in the first round. Tshibaka had led Murkowski narrowly since Election Day, but Murkowski took a lead and noted it in a tweet on her campaign account Friday.
Murkowski posted a GIF from the movie “The Usual Suspects,” including the start of one line from the movie.
“And just like that …” the GIF states, with text overlaying it continuing, “Kelly’s claim that she only lost because of Ranked Choice was gone.”
Murkowski led Tshibaka by about 0.4 points in the first-place votes with 98 percent reporting as of Friday night.
Under ranked choice, the candidate with the fewest first-place votes is eliminated if no one wins a majority in the first round, and their votes are then redistributed to the remaining candidates according to their voters’ second preferences.
Republican Buzz Kelley received less than 3 percent of the vote, so he will be eliminated first, and Democrat Pat Chesbro, who won about 10 percent of the vote, will be eliminated in the second round.
Whichever candidate receives more of Chesbro’s votes will likely win the race. Analysts view Murkowski as more likely to prevail, as she is more moderate and less supportive of former President Trump than Tshibaka is.
All absentee votes will be counted by Wednesday, and the additional vote tallies from the additional rounds will be published then.
Conservatives previously slammed ranked-choice voting after Rep. Mary Sattler Peltola (D) won the special election for Alaska’s House seat in August over Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich through receiving enough first- and second-place votes to prevail.",2022-11-19T04:04:51Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
R. Kelly's Manager Receives Jail Sentence for Stalking Singer's Victim,"R. Kelly's manager, Donnell Russell, was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Thursday, after pleading guilty to stalking one of the singer's sexual abuse victims and the unnamed woman's mother.
Per a statement released by the Department of Justice, Russell was charged with interstate stalking, harassing the victim, identified as Jane Doe, via telephone calls, text messages, and emails.
The prosecution accused Russell of launching the campaign to discourage the victim from coming forward with accusations against disgraced musician Kelly, 55.
Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in announcing the sentence: ""For more than a year, the defendant engaged in a vicious campaign to harass, humiliate and threaten the victim in order to force her to dismiss her lawsuit against R. Kelly and stop speaking publicly about him.
""The punishment meted out to the defendant today is a victory for crime victims, particularly those of sexual assault and abuse, who are often reluctant to come forward to law enforcement or pursue legal recourse, given the trauma and fear of retaliation associated with publicly discussing their experiences.""
Kelly, full name Robert Sylvester Kelly, was in September found guilty in his Chicago federal trial of several charges related to child porn.
He was found guilty of six charges related to sexual abuse of minors, the production of child pornography and an alleged cover-up, Courthouse News Service reported. The jury chose to acquit him on seven additional charges.
The R&B star had been on trial along with one of his former assistants, Milton ""June"" Brown, and his previous business manager, Derrel McDavid. The charges brought against Kelly included sexual exploitation of children, child pornography and conspiracy to defraud the U.S.
For their part, Brown and McDavid face allegations that they had conspired to ""bribe and intimidate witnesses in a bid to conceal evidence pertaining to a 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges in Cook County, Illinois,"" Newsweek previously reported.
In another trial, jurors found Kelly guilty on nine counts of federal racketeering and sex trafficking. He was slapped with a 30-year prison sentence in June, although his attorneys previously stated that they would seek an appeal.

R. Kelly's ex-manager Donnell Russell gets prison for harassing victim,"R. Kelly’s former manager was hit with a 20-month prison sentence Thursday for harassing and intimidating a victim of the disgraced hip-hop star.
A federal judge in Brooklyn handed down the sentence to Donnell Russell, the self-appointed manager of Kelly, after he pleaded guilty to one count of interstate stalking over the summer.
The Chicago native threatened to publicize sexually explicit photos of the victim, who was connected to the federal racketeering case against Kelly in the same jurisdiction, according to the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York.
The harassment began after she filed a civil lawsuit against Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, and dragged on as it became clear she was also a victim in Kelly’s federal criminal case and could potentially testify.
Kelly was convicted of all nine counts in Brooklyn federal court in 2021 and was sentenced to 30 years in prison earlier this year.

US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace called the punishment against Russell, 47, a “victory for crime victims.”
“For more than a year, the defendant engaged in a vicious campaign to harass, humiliate and threaten the victim in order to force her to dismiss her lawsuit against R. Kelly and stop speaking publicly about him,” Peace said in a statement.
“The punishment meted out to the defendant today is a victory for crime victims, particularly those of sexual assault and abuse, who are often reluctant to come forward to law enforcement or pursue legal recourse, given the trauma and fear of retaliation associated with publicly discussing their experiences.”
Federal prosecutors said when Russell pleaded guilty that he could’ve faced as many as five years behind bars.
From November 2018 to February 2020, the Kelly loyalist originally threatened to reveal the sexually explicit pics of the victim and her sexual history in a bid to stop the civil lawsuit against the “I Believe I Can Fly,” singer, the feds said.
Russell sent intimating texts to the victim and her mother, the feds said. Alec Tabak
Russell even mailed a letter to her lawyer in November 2018 with cropped nude photos of the victim, prosecutors said.
The text of the note read, “the next two pictures have been cropped for the sake of not exposing her extremities to the world, yet!!!”
The next month Russell, using the alias Colon Dunn, sent a flurry of cruel texts to the victim and her mother with the same nude photos and wrote, “Just a sample. We will seek criminal charges. You’ve been warned,” and additionally said, “Publishing soon,” prosecutors said.
He also divulged, “[T]his is Colon.”
At the start of 2019, Russell again texted the victim and her mother, warning, “Pull the plug or you will be exposed.”
The same month, he started up a Facebook page that defended Kelly and posted texts between the hip-hop artist and victim with the same private photos. Then a year later, he again showed the sexually explicit photos during live interviews on YouTube with vloggers who supported Kelly, prosecutors said.
Russell’s ill-advised backing of Kelly also got him in trouble when he was convicted in July of a federal charge for calling in an active-shooter threat to a private Manhattan club that was scheduled to show a screening of the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” in 2018.",2022-11-17T23:33:05Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
R. Kelly files motions for new trial or reversal of conviction,"R. Kelly filed two motions in Chicago’s federal court Tuesday requesting a new trial or reversal of his child pornography and sex abuse convictions, the Chicago Tribune reports.
The embattled R&B artist was found guilty in September of three counts of child pornography. He was acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge stemming from a 2008 child pornography trial and a fourth pornography count.
In the Tuesday motions, Kelly’s attorney Jennifer Bonjean requested an acquittal on all counts. Bonjean argued, among other things, there was a lack of evidence that Kelly “coerced” his underage victims and that a witness revealed false information in court.
Bonjean claimed Dr. Darrel Turner, an expert on sexual predators called to testify by the government, made false statements including ones detailing the amount of money he charged the prosecution.
“Had the jurors known that Dr. Turner actively misled them, the jurors would likely have rejected his testimony outright,” Bonjean wrote, according to the Tribune.
Kelly was previously sentenced to 30 years in prison after being convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York. His sentencing for the federal charges is set for Feb. 23.",2022-11-17T22:59:51Z,https://www.wcia.com,wcia.com
R. Kelly crony gets 20 months in prison for harassing victim,"An R. Kelly crony was sentenced to 20 months behind bars for releasing explicit photos of the disgraced singer’s victim on the internet — but not before he whined that his reputation had taken a hit after his arrest.
Donnell Russell, 47, described his yearlong harassment campaign against the victim and her mother as “bad decisions,” and a mistake, and asked Judge Ann Donnelly to grant him probation.

“I’m not going to say that I didn’t make bad decisions. I did,” he said Thursday in a rambling monologue to the judge, where he described his success as a businessman and music executive, and how he got pulled into R. Kelly’s orbit. “I can’t even Google my name. R. Kelly pops up. I’ve got to live with that for the rest of my life... I got sucked into the whirlwind just like anybody else.”

But Donnelly said his behavior was no mere mistake or lapse of judgment.

“You talk about when someone Googles your name, this is what they found out. Think about when someone Googles your victim, because she had the nerve to challenge R. Kelly,” Judge Donnelly said. “This is an attack on our justice system.”
The victim, identified in court documents as Jane Doe, filed a lawsuit in May 2018, and six months later Russell sent a letter to her lawyer with cropped photos of her and copies of embarrassing text messages. He wrote that the “pictures ha[d] been cropped for the sake of not exposing her extremities to the world, yet!!!”
The idea was to get her to drop her lawsuit, but she held fast, so in January 2019, he posted the photos on a Facebook page called “Surviving Lies” — a reference to the “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary series — and held the same pictures up during YouTube video interviews a year later.
“This was a campaign of threats and intimidation that lasted for over a year,” Judge Ann Donnelly said Thursday. “This is not a mistake or a lapse in judgment.”

To make matters worse, Russell appeared in a YouTube interview a day after his July guilty plea describing the victim and her mother as “questionable.” In a court filing, prosecutors said he sounded boastful about his harassment campaign.
Russell was also convicted in July in Manhattan Federal Court, for calling in a mass shooting threat to stop the theater premiere “Surviving R. Kelly.” He’s slated to be sentenced in that case next month.
The victim’s mother, who phoned into the sentencing hearing, described the “enormous amount of pandemonium” caused by the shooting threat, adding that her daughter suffered a seizure in the aftermath.
Her family has been subject to continued harassment by R. Kelly fans and by Russell’s “blogger friends,” the woman said.

“He thinks this is a joke,” she said. “What he has done is cause not only (my daughter) but other victims to live a life of fear... This man should not be awarded probation. He should sit in jail and think about his actions.”
Russell, who describes himself as a “consultant” and friend of Kelly, said he met the singer while they were both performing on a subway about 30 years ago. Kelly asked to help him track down why his royalties were vanishing, and he claims he was trying to protect the R & B star from the victim’s civil suit.
“I saw a lawsuit first,” he said. “I didn’t see women first. I saw a payoff of $250,000 for this, a payoff for that.”

Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June on sex trafficking and racketeering charges in Brooklyn Federal Court. A jury found him guilty of running a decades-long sexual abuse operation by using his fame to lure underage girls and keeping them under his thumb through physical and emotional abuse.
Russell is scheduled to surrender himself to custody on Feb. 21.
The judge offered him a parting piece of advice: stop going on YouTube to talk about the case.

R. Kelly Manager Prison Sentence for Stalking Abuse Victim,"R. Kelly’s former manager was sentenced Thursday to 20 months in prison after pleading guilty to charges that he stalked one of Kelly’s sexual abuse victims in an effort to keep her silent.
Donnell Russell pleaded guilty in July to using threats, harassment and intimidation to silence one of the women abused by Kelly, who was convicted last year on sex trafficking and racketeering charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison in June.
Ahead of his sentencing, Russell’s lawyers argued he should receive only probation, arguing he’d led an “otherwise exemplary life” before “crossing the line in his attempts to curry favor with Robert Kelly.”
But prosecutors strongly disagreed, citing dozens of prior arrests and calling his conduct “abhorrent.” They asked for 24 to 30 months, saying it was needed to deter such behavior: “If victims are concerned that this type of conduct will not be adequately punished, it could chill victims from pursuing legal remedies and from cooperating with law enforcement investigations.”
Following Thursday’s sentencing, Russell’s attorney did not immediately return a request for comment from Billboard.
Prosecutors say Russell, a self-described manager, advisor and friend to Kelly, used “reprehensible” tactics against the unnamed victim after she filed a civil lawsuit against the singer in 2018. They included sending threatening messages to the woman and her mother, and then publishing explicit photos of her on the internet.
“Just a sample. We will seek criminal charges. You’ve been warned,” Russell wrote in a December 2018 message to the victim and her mother, referring to the nude images.
Separate from the stalking charges, Russell was also convicted in July of making a phone threat that gunfire was about to occur at a crowded Manhattan theater that was preparing for a premiere of Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly series. The phone threat prompted a call to police and an evacuation that forced the premier to be canceled.
Russell awaits sentencing next week on those charges.",2022-11-17T18:57:45Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Lisa Murkowski closes gap in Senate race against Trump-endorsed Kelly Tshibaka,"Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) closed the gap Wednesday against GOP challenger Kelly Tshibaka and is close to shoring up enough votes to win her fourth term under the state's new ranked choice voting system.
Murkowski made the gains after a big batch of absentee and early ballots were counted Tuesday.
SEAN HANNITY RAILS AGAINST MITCH MCCONNELL OVER ALASKA SENATE RACE
The newest ballot tally put Murkowski less than 600 votes, or about 0.3%, behind Tshibaka, a candidate who was hand-picked and endorsed by former President Donald Trump in a bid to unseat Murkowski, a Republican senator who voted to impeach him.
Murkowski is considered to be one of the more centrist Republican voices in Congress, and her win could help President Joe Biden pass his agenda as well as extend her clout in the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim majority.
Even though the path to a win for Tshibaka has been all but blocked, her campaign adviser Mary Ann Pruitt claimed the new vote totals were ""an ominous sign"" for Murkowski ""to be trailing at all at this stage of tabulations,"" the Anchorage Daily News reported.
Neither Murkowski nor Tshibaka is expected to reach the 50% threshold needed for an outright win, which means the race will come down to a ranked choice tabulation.
Under that system, instead of picking a single candidate for office, Alaskan voters were allowed to rank whom they wanted to fill a particular position. In the first round of counting, if no candidate makes it to the 50% mark, it goes to a second round, which starts with the candidate who got the fewest votes in the first round being eliminated. If the eliminated candidate was a voter's top pick, their next choice would get their vote in the round. This continues until one candidate is declared the winner.
Additional rounds of voting won't start until Nov. 23.

Of the four candidates in play, it's likely that Republican Buzz Kelley will be the first candidate eliminated. Kelley has endorsed Tshibaka, so some of his votes will go to her. In the third round of voting, it's likely Democrat Pat Chesbro will be eliminated. Most of Chesbro's supporters are expected to rank Murkowski ahead of Tshibaka, securing the senator's win.",2022-11-17T03:33:59Z,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,Washington Examiner
R. Kelly files motions for new trial or reversal of conviction,"R. Kelly filed two motions in Chicago’s federal court Tuesday requesting a new trial or reversal of his child pornography and sex abuse convictions, the Chicago Tribune reports.
The embattled R&B artist was found guilty in September of three counts of child pornography. He was acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge stemming from a 2008 child pornography trial and a fourth pornography count.
In the Tuesday motions, Kelly’s attorney Jennifer Bonjean requested an acquittal on all counts. Bonjean argued, among other things, there was a lack of evidence that Kelly “coerced” his underage victims and that a witness revealed false information in court.
Bonjean claimed Dr. Darrel Turner, an expert on sexual predators called to testify by the government, made false statements including ones detailing the amount of money he charged the prosecution.
“Had the jurors known that Dr. Turner actively misled them, the jurors would likely have rejected his testimony outright,” Bonjean wrote, according to the Tribune.
Kelly was previously sentenced to 30 years in prison after being convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York. His sentencing for the federal charges is set for Feb. 23.",2022-11-17T03:22:57Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill

Disgraced singer R. Kelly filed a pair of motions in Chicago’s federal court Tuesday seeking a new trial or an outright reversal of his conviction two months ago on child pornography and other sex abuse-related charges.
The motions filed by Kelly’s lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, almost certainly will be denied by the trial judge, but still preserve arguments that likely will be made later in an appeal to the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.

Kelly, 55, was convicted by a jury in September on charges including child pornography related to his years of sexual abuse of his underage goddaughter, “Jane,” and other girls. He was acquitted, however, of the explosive allegations that he rigged his initial Cook County trial in 2008. U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber has set sentencing for Feb. 23.
In her first post-trial motion, filed after business hours Tuesday, Bonjean asked Leinenweber for a judgment of acquittal on all counts based on several technical factors, including that prosecutors had not proven that the infamous videotape of Kelly abusing “Jane” at his home on West George Street was made for the “purpose” of producing child pornography.

Bonjean also argued that there was insufficient evidence that the tape had ever crossed state lines, an element that prosecutors were required to prove. And on other counts, Bonjean argued, prosecutors failed to prove that Kelly had “coerced” underage victims to engage in sex acts.
Bonjean’s other motion asked for a new trial based on alleged misstatements by the government’s first witness at trial, Dr. Darrel Turner, who testified as an expert about how sexual predators “groom” underage victims.
Turner told the jury that he billed prosecutors $250 per hour for his work on the case, when the actual figure was $450, Bonjean wrote. He also underrepresented how many hours he was paid for, telling the jury it was two hours, when he actually billed for six and a half, according to Bonjean. She said prosecutors knew about the misstatements but failed to correct them for the jury.

Prosecutors are expected to file responses to Bonjean’s allegations later this month.
Kelly, who is facing potentially decades in prison for the Chicago conviction, has already been sentenced to 30 years after a jury in New York found him guilty of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging his musical career doubled as a criminal enterprise aimed at satisfying his predatory sexual desires.
The former R&B star also faces four separate Cook County indictments, in which prosecutors allege he sexually abused or assaulted four people, three of whom were underage girls at the time.
Earlier this week, Cook County prosecutors said they were waiting on more information, including transcripts from the federal cases, before determining how to go forward on those cases.

Two months after R. Kelly’s second federal trial concluded, there has been no apparent movement in his Cook County cases.
At a two-minute hearing before Judge Lawrence Flood on Monday, Cook County prosecutors said they were waiting on more information, including transcripts from the federal cases, before determining how to go forward on the disgraced R&B superstar’s charges.

There was significant interest in Monday’s hearing in part because of a recent Instagram Stories post from the verified account of Jerhonda Pace, a Kelly accuser central to his New York federal trial and one of his Cook County cases. The post claimed that State’s Attorney Kim Foxx’s office would soon be dismissing charges.
“(It) will be hard for the survivors, especially those who were waiting for their day in court. Though it is disappointing, I understand. New York ... did a great job getting us justice and taking these matters seriously,” the post stated. “Nonetheless, I do thank @kimfoxx for trying.”

The Tribune could not reach Pace for comment last week.
But Cook County prosecutors on Monday in fact said little about the future of Kelly’s cases, telling Flood only that they would need another month to review.
Also Monday, attorney Jennifer Bonjean joined Steve Greenberg on Kelly’s defense team. Bonjean was Kelly’s lead attorney at sentencing in New York and at his Chicago federal trial; Greenberg has been representing Kelly on the county charges since they were filed in early 2019.
“I am eager to see where the state stands on this and push forward,” Bonjean said in court Monday. “I’m happy to accommodate a 30-day (delay), but I don’t think transcripts should stand in the way of anything beyond 30 days.”

Kelly faces four separate Cook County indictments, in which prosecutors allege he sexually abused or assaulted four people, three of whom — including Pace — were underage girls at the time.
Greenberg months ago filed a formal request to throw out the county case related to Pace. That motion has yet to be argued. Greenberg has also stated he intends to file a similar request on one of the other cases.
The county cases made a splash when they were announced in early 2019, but were overshadowed a few months later when federal prosecutors brought a one-two punch of indictments in New York and Chicago. The county cases have largely stalled out ever since.
Kelly was convicted in Chicago federal court in September on charges including child pornography related to his years of sexual abuse of his underage goddaughter and other girls. He was acquitted, however, of the explosive allegations that he rigged his initial Cook County trial in the 2000s. Sentencing in that case is scheduled for February.

"Trump requested IRS probes of Comey, McCabe: John Kelly tells NYT","Former President Trump requested Internal Revenue Service (IRS) probes of two former top FBI officials, his former chief of staff John Kerry told the New York Times.
Kelly told the Times that Trump repeatedly pressed for IRS investigations of his perceived enemies and asked to “get the I.R.S. on” former FBI Director James Comey and his deputy Andrew McCabe, who became acting director after Trump fired Comey.
Kelly said he dissuaded Trump from continuing to press the investigations due to legal and ethical concerns.
However, reports surfaced earlier this year that the IRS had conducted intensive audits of both Comey and McCabe.
The tax collection agency insisted the audits were randomly conducted free from political pressure. Trump appointee Charles Rettig ran the IRS during both audits.
“Maybe it’s a coincidence or maybe somebody misused the IRS to get at a political enemy,” Comey told the Times earlier this year. “Given the role Trump wants to continue to play in our country, we should know the answer to that question.”
Trump was critical of both Comey and McCabe at multiple points throughout his presidency, particularly for their part in investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Trump fired Comey in May of 2017 and offered shifting defenses for the move.
According to the Times, Trump also floated wielding the DOJ and IRS on Jeff Bezos, Hillary Clinton and former CIA director John Brennan.

Masters declines to concede in Arizona Senate race until all votes are counted,"Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters (R) released a statement on Saturday indicating that he would decline to concede until all the votes were counted in his race against Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arz.).
Several outlets including NBC and The Associated Press called the race for Kelly Friday night, inching Democrats one seat closer to a majority in the upper chamber.
Party control of either chamber of Congress remains unknown at this juncture as votes across the country continue to be counted.
“If, at the end, Senator Kelly has more of them than I do, then I will congratulate him on a hard-fought victory. But voters decide, not the media; let’s count the votes,” Masters tweeted Saturday.
Kelly received 51.8 percent of the vote in Arizona, compared to Masters’s 46.1 percent, with 83 percent of the state reporting. The incumbent is currently ahead by approximately 124,000 votes, receiving 1,128,917 as of Saturday morning compared to Masters’s 1,005,001.
“For my people who knocked doors in the 115 degree heat, and for the million+ Arizonans who put their faith in me, we are going to make sure that every legal vote is counted,” the Trump-endorsed Republican wrote.
Masters has publicly denied the results of the 2020 presidential election, including in an election ad his team posted in November 2021, a year after former President Trump lost his reelection to President Biden.
“I think Trump won in 2020,” Masters said in the video sponsored by Blake Masters for U.S. Senate.

Mark Kelly defeats Blake Masters in Arizona Senate race,"Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) is projected to win reelection to the Senate, defeating Republican Blake Masters in one of the preeminent battleground contests on the midterm map this year and putting Democrats one step closer to securing their majority.
Kelly, who is completing the final two years of the late Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) term, held a steady lead over Masters, a protege of PayPal founder Peter Thiel, since the early August primary, though his lead slimmed in the final weeks.

His ultimate victory is a key hold for Senate Democrats as they await the results of Senate races in Nevada, which is undergoing a similarly drawn-out counting process, and Georgia, which has gone to a Dec. 6 runoff. It also marks a defeat of one of the most closely watched candidates elevated by former President Trump.
Kelly, a retired astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), was buoyed throughout by a juggernaut of a fundraising operation. According to his FEC filing on Oct. 19, the final financial snapshot of his campaign, Kelly raised more than $80 million for the run, a number that allowed him to flood the airwaves throughout the three-plus month stretch between the primary and Tuesday’s election.
By contrast, Masters only raised $8 million, with more than half of that total being raised by July 13 to help him win the primary over businessman Jim Lamon and state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, forcing him to rely on outside money to help boost him in the final months of the campaign.

After receiving $15 million in outside money from Peter Thiel to help guide him through the primary, a battle between Thiel and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) emerged over who was going to help Masters financially in the final stretch of the campaign. After Thiel proposed that each spend $5 million to help the GOP nominee, talks broke down and the Senate Leadership Fund decided not to engage further.
Signaling troubles, the Senate Leadership Fund canceled nearly $10 million in ads in late September, leaving other GOP groups to pick up the slack. Among those was the Club For Growth, which spent an additional $5.5 million on Oct. 28 to boost Masters.
Notably, Masters not only lost to Kelly, but was unable to keep pace with Republican Kari Lake, who became the driving force behind the GOP ticket in the state over the final months. Trump, who endorsed both candidates, referenced Lake when talking to Masters over the phone days after he took part in a debate with Kelly and did not give a satisfactory answer on election fraud in the eyes of Trump.

“I heard you did great on the debate but [had] a bad election answer. … You got a lot of support. You gotta stay with those people,” Trump told Masters on the call before referencing Lake as an example.
“Look at Kari. Kari’s winning with very little money. If they say, ‘How is your family?’ She says, ‘The election was rigged and stolen,’” the former president told Masters. “You’ll lose if you go soft. You’re gonna lose that base.”

"Masters slams McConnell over campaign spending, says he shouldn’t be Senate GOP leader","Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters (R) slammed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Friday night, saying that the top Republican should have directed more campaign spending his way to take on Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) in the 2022 midterms.
As of Friday night, Kelly leads Masters in the state 51.6 percent to 46.3 percent, respectively, with 79 percent of the votes counted, according to The Associated Press. However, the race has yet to be called amid uncertainty about which party will control the upper chamber.
During an interview with Fox News, Masters told host Tucker Carlson that if a McConnell-aligned super PAC, Senate Leadership Fund, had spent more money into the Arizona Senate race, the contest would be over by now.
“The people who control the purse strings, Senate Leadership Fund, Mitch McConnell — McConnell decided to spend millions of dollars attacking a fellow Republican in Alaska instead of helping me defeat Senator Mark Kelly,” an animated Masters said.
“Had he chosen to spend money in Arizona, this race would be over we’d be celebrating a Senate Majority right now,” he continued.
The Senate Leadership Fund withdrew ad spending from Arizona in August, a move that presented problems for the Trump-backed GOP candidate for Senate less than three months out from Election Day.
The PAC called off its advertisement reservations that were set to air in Arizona between Sept. 6 and Oct. 3, according to AdImpact. The ad cancellation amounted to $8 million, about half of what the group was intending to spend in the state.
In September, the PAC confirmed it was cutting an additional $9.6 million in ad buys for the race between Oct. 4 and Election Day, but said at the time that a majority of the reservation had already been made up by outside conservative groups.
On Friday, Masters went so far as to call on Senate Republicans not to vote for McConnell as GOP leader in the upper chamber, arguing that he doesn’t deserve the position.
“And so my message to the people of America, my message to actually my, the Republican senators, hopefully my future colleagues, let’s not vote Mitch McConnell into leadership. He doesn’t deserve to be majority leader or minority leader,” Masters said.
Masters’s comments come after other Senate Republicans have pointed the finger at McConnell after Republicans around the country failed to deliver the “red wave” that pollsters and lawmakers alike expected.
On Friday, Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called for Senate leadership elections to be postponed amid rumblings that Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) would launch a long-shot bid for McConnell’s post.
Hawley told RealClearPolitcs in an interview that “Washington Republicanism” and McConnell’s decision not to offer an alternative vision hurt the Republican Party on Election Day.",2022-11-12T02:28:34Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill

Year 1 of the Kelly era at No. 7 LSU looks to be memorable,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Hiring coach Brian Kelly away from Notre Dame already has cost LSU $500,000 more than anticipated — not that anyone in Baton Rouge is complaining.
The Southeastern Conference will lay a second $250,000 fine on the Tigers after fans poured onto their home field after taking down Alabama 32-31 in overtime on Saturday night.
Between that and the Oct. 22 win over then-unbeaten Ole Miss, freshly minted No. 7 LSU (7-2, 4-1 SEC) is the favorite to represent the SEC Western Division in the conference title game on Dec. 3.
“A win like this gives us so much more confidence because we beat two top-10 teams in a row heading into next week against Arkansas,” LSU fourth-year running back Josh Williams said after the Alabama win. “We are ready.
“In a way, it feels like my freshman season all over again when we went to the national championship,” added Williams, who was a true freshman on LSU’s 2019 team and didn’t play in any games.
Williams rushed for a short touchdown in the 45-20 win over Ole Miss and on Saturday, he ran for a 2-yard touchdown in the third quarter of a back-and-forth rivalry game that ended with LSU converting a do-or-die 2-point conversion.
The moment true freshman tight end Mason Taylor crashed down across the goal line to clinch the victory, jubilant fans who’d filled 102,000-seat Death Valley with ear-splitting roars all night spilled onto the field from all corners. They left the goal posts intact, but lingered in celebration while numerous LSU players re-emerged from the locker room tunnel, phones in hand, to capture the scene, pose for photos and exchange high-fives.
It was LSU’s first home victory over Alabama since 2010 — and Sept. 4 seemed like a distant memory when the Tigers opened the season with a 24-23 loss to Florida State in New Orleans.
For a program that hadn’t posted a winning record in the previous two seasons, these two wins over top-10 teams shows that, as Williams said, Tigers have “a process that they stick to religiously.“
“Coach Kelly is very adamant on that,” Williams said.
Kelly won school-record 113 games in 12 seasons at Notre Dame — once reaching the BCS national championship game — before LSU lured him away with a 10-year contract worth about $100 million.
LSU athletic director Scott Woodward said the deal represented an institutional decision to bank on a proven commodity as opposed to betting on an up-and-comer. That was nothing new for Woodward, who in the same role at Texas A&M hired Jimbo Fisher away from Florida State with a similarly lucrative offer.
Woodward’s goal was to bring to LSU a coach who could harness Louisiana’s passion for — and financial commitment to — college football and put the Tigers in position to consistently challenge Alabama and coach Nick Saban for SEC supremacy.
That was an enticing proposition for the 61-year-old Kelly, who at Notre Dame twice met Alabama in the postseason and lost by multiple touchdowns.
But implicit in Kelly’s long contract was that the coach would be granted a reasonable timeline for turning things around. The whole 2022 coaching staff was new except for offensive line coach Brad Davis. So was much of the roster, including Jayden Daniels, a dual-threat quarterback who has flourished since transferring from Arizona State.
Then there are the true freshmen standouts like starting left tackle Will Campbell, play-making linebacker Harold Perkins and Taylor, who also made a difficult, leaping, fourth-quarter touchdown catch between two defenders against Alabama.
Even Kelly conceded to being “emotional” as he took in the wild celebration Saturday.
“I knew after the Florida State game we were going to get better ... but I don’t think I have ever in my career looked at the crystal ball and said, ‘Hey, this is how many wins we are going to get,’“ Kelly said. “What I did know is that they had fight in them.”
Indeed, Kelly said, his decision to call for the 2-point conversion was inspired by the spirit and commitment his players had exhibited since their season-opening setback: “I’m willing to do anything for this group because they have shown that they will make it happen some way.”
If they can make it happen again at Arkansas this Saturday and at Texas A&M on Nov. 26, they’ll wrap up Year 1 of the Kelly era in the SEC Championship game and, at the very least, a major bowl game — if not a berth in the College Football Playoff.
NOTES
The NCAA officially recognizes 92 of Kelly’s Notre Dame victories, having vacated 21 wins from 2012 and 2013 because of an academic misconduct investigation centered on a student trainer. Notre Dame disputed the NCAA's decision.

Masters says he’s ‘prepared to be a thorn in the side’ of McConnell if elected in Arizona,"Blake Masters, the Republican nominee for Senate in Arizona, says he is “prepared to be a thorn in the side” of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) if he is elected.
Masters, who is running against Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly (Ariz.), said in an interview with The Daily Mail that he sees Arizona Sen. Krysten Sinema (D) as an example of being willing to hold on principle to get desired legislation.
In an evenly divided 50-50 Senate with Democrats having the tiebreaking vote in Vice President Harris, Sinema has often had extensive power in the chances of a bill’s success as one of the most moderate Democrats in Congress.
Masters said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) “owns” Kelly but does not own Sinema.
He said he is prepared to block legislation until the southern border with Mexico is secure.
“I’m not going to try to make his life miserable for the sake of it,” he said, referring to McConnell. “But I’m going to be happy to be independent.”
Data from U.S. Customs and Border Control released last month showed more than 2.76 million people illegally crossed the southern border last fiscal year, a new record.
Masters pledged to “not vote for a single thing” that President Biden wants until border security is enhanced. He said this includes any funding or judicial nominees.
“It’s like, I’d rather have gridlock than just tolerate the crazy that Joe Biden is doing to us,” he said.
Masters said he expects he will be able to work with Sinema, and the two of them representing Arizona would accurately reflect where the state is at.
The race between Kelly and Masters has tightened as Election Day has gotten closer — particularly after third-party candidate Marc Victor dropped out and endorsed Masters — but most polls show Kelly with a narrow lead.

The three candidates touched on issues like abortion, inflation and election security in the hourlong debate, which was moderated by Alaska Public Media news director Lori Townsend and Alaska’s News Source managing editor Mike Ross.
Murkowski and Tshibaka emerged as front-runners in the state’s nonpartisan primary earlier this year, but Chesbro is still in the ring. The fourth candidate on the ballot, Buzz Kelley (R), suspended his campaign last month.
Alaska’s elections now use a ranked choice voting system, in which voters rank their candidates by preference. The new setup, approved by Alaskan voters in 2020, allows both Murkowski and Tshibaka to be on the November ballot, even though they hail from the same party.
Here are five takeaways from the Alaska Senate debate.
Trump gets only a passing mention

Former President Trump made Murkowski a top target after she and six other Republican senators broke rank with their party leader and voted to convict him on charges of incitement of insurrection over the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.
Trump endorsed Tshibaka’s bid last year and has slammed Murkowski as “worse than a Democrat.”
But despite the former president’s concerted and high-profile efforts to influence the race and oust the three-term senator, he got only a passing mention in Thursday’s debate.
Asked by moderators whether Trump should testify before the House select committee investigating Jan. 6 in compliance with the panel’s recent subpoena, Murkowski said he should answer the summons.
“When a subpoena is issued to a former president, it is not done lightly. I think this needs to be taken seriously. I think that he should accept and testify under subpoena. I doubt that he will,” Murkowski said.
Tshibaka sidestepped the question, saying the legality of the subpoena is to be judged by the court system and arguing that the matter hasn’t been a core topic in her conversations with Alaskan voters.
“The people who engaged in illegal activity that day were the ones who entered the Capitol and broke the laws, and they should be held accountable,” Tshibaka said, declining to mention Trump by name in her response.

The incumbent senator underscored her bipartisan record across her two decades in the upper chamber, highlighting work with both Republicans and Democrats.
She touted her work on the bipartisan infrastructure law, an effort championed by Democrats, and underscored her work with a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by “very conservative Republican” Sen. John Cornyn (Texas) on the Safer Communities Act.
On the subject of election security, she also noted her work on the bipartisan Electoral Count Act and said she has been “the only Republican that has, over the years, come forward” to support the John Lewis Voting Rights Act as a template for reformed election laws.
Murkowski also emphasized her moderate stance on the contentious issue of abortion. “The bipartisan effort that I have introduced in the United States Senate is one that, again, codifies Roe, but does so in ensuring that there are limitations,” she said.
Murkowski bucked her own party earlier this week when she announced she’d rank Democrat Rep. Mary Peltola first on her ballot in the state’s House race.
Tshibaka paints opponent as extreme

Though Murkowski owned her bipartisan policy choices, Trump-backed Tshibaka repeatedly sought to paint Murkowski as the extreme candidate, emphasizing the incumbent’s support for some Biden administration policies.
Tshibaka accused Murkowski of confirming “radical environmentalist nominees” in the state in alignment with the Biden administration’s environmental approach and hit at her positions on abortion as “extreme.” She referred to Murkowski throughout the debate as “the incumbent.”
Murkowski in turn took a stab at Tshibaka for her absence from Alaska in recent years.
“Frankly, she’s been gone from the state for 28 years, and she’s out of touch with Alaskans and what Alaskans expect and want. Alaskans want results. They don’t want partisan political rhetoric,” Murkowski said.

Tshibaka more than once tried to tie Murkowski to dark money groups and donors affiliated with the Washington, arguing that the incumbent is “beholden” to those groups.
“Unlike others, I haven’t accepted dark money from large, lower-48 commercial trawlers,” Tshibaka said.
“Why are you beholden to lower-48 and D.C. dark money that doesn’t care about our Alaska future?” she asked Murkowski.
The incumbent senator acknowledged that she received funding from outside of Alaska but insisted that Tshibaka “couldn’t be further from the truth” in her allegations of being beholden to those donors.
“We recognize that there are outside groups that are weighing in, they’re weighing in on my campaign. They’re weighing in on your campaign. … They’re weighing in on a host of different campaigns … but as a candidate, we know we can’t control that,” Murkowski said.
“There is no Lisa Murkowski being beholden to any outside interests,” she added.
A low-key affair

Ultimately, while the race between Tshibaka and Murkowski has drawn national attention as Trump and others wade in, Thursday’s debate didn’t provide any major fireworks and likely won’t significantly impact the outcome.
Still, as sedate as the debate was, there are still questions as to how the race will play out, thanks to the state’s new voting system. With ranked choice voting, a candidate needs more than 50 percent of the vote to clinch the win outright.
If no candidate secures that share in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is dropped off the ballot — and those who ranked that candidate first will then have their votes shifted to their second choice.
The system may end up being a boost for Murkowski, as she’ll likely snap up some support from Democrats who rank the moderate Republican as their second choice.",2022-10-28T05:16:35Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
Alaska Republicans vote to censure McConnell,"The Alaska Republican Party on Monday voted to censure Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for what they called spreading “divisive and misleading statements” about their endorsed candidate in Alaska’s Senate race.
The state party added that McConnell’s financial support for incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in the Senate race against fellow Republican Kelly Tshibaka was “in direct contradiction” to the party, according to a copy of the resolution posted Monday night on Facebook.
“Much of the financial support from the Senate Leadership Fund has been used for malicious political attack ads targeted at our endorsed candidate, Kelly Tshibaka, that are gross distortions of fact,” the resolution reads. “We request the Senate Leadership Fund immediately stop the attack ads against Kelly Tshibaka and discontinue the support of all other opposing candidates.”
The resolution passed by a 49-8 vote, according to local news reports.
The Alaska Republican Party also censured Murkowski last year after she voted to convict former President Trump in his impeachment trial for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Tshibaka is endorsed by Trump, who has become a vocal critic of McConnell and has pushed for the Senate leader to step down.
McConnell, who runs the Senate Leadership Fund, has spent millions on ads attacking Tshibaka to support Murkowski, a 20-year incumbent.
According to FactCheck.org, some of the ads aired in the race have been misleading, including one claiming Tshibaka wants to ban birth control by mail.
The Alaska Republican Party, which endorsed Tshibaka last year well ahead of the primary election, said in its resolution that it has also sent out statements warning voters not to believe the “attack ads.”
Alaska’s November general election is a ranked-choice process, where a candidate needs more than 50 percent of the vote to win.

Secret grand jury proceedings in R. Kelly’s case made public,"A recent motion by attorneys for R. Kelly’s former business manager, Derrell McDavid, did more than just seek government reimbursement of McDavid’s legal fees — it also lifted the curtain on secretive grand jury proceedings that led to the bombshell indictment in the first place.
In making the unusual argument that prosecutors should be on the hook for $850,000 in the wake of McDavid’s acquittal, attorney Beau Brindley attached transcripts of grand jury meetings and testimony that were supposed to remain under wraps essentially forever.
The transcripts — which were public for several hours Tuesday before prosecutors asked the court clerk to seal them — detail a crucial February 2020 meeting of the special grand jury where prosecutors were seeking the return of a superseding indictment against Kelly, McDavid, and a third associate, Milton “June” Brown.
While grand jury proceedings sometimes come out in open court in snippets of transcripts to buttress other testimony or impeach a witness on the stand, the filings in the R. Kelly case offered a rare glimpse of how prosecutors go about securing an indictment in a high-profile case.
Here are some of the revelations in the filings:
The grand jurors were wondering about something that later became a major issue in the trial: Where was the alleged tape at the heart of the conspiracy charges?
Near the beginning of the Feb. 13, 2020, session, a grand juror asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Angel Krull, who was heading up the investigation, “Has the missing porn tape ever showed up? There was like, a bunch.”
The reference was to what prosecutors called “Video 4,” a tape Kelly purportedly made at his home on West George Street in the late 1990s showing him having illegal sexual contact with his underage goddaughter and young woman, Lisa Van Allen.
Van Allen testified that she stole the tape from Kelly’s collection and sent it to her friend, Keith Murrell, in Kansas City. The conspiracy charges alleged Kelly’s legal team later hired another man, T-shirt merchandiser Charles Freeman, to get the tape back.
Krull told the grand jury panel the tape still “has not surfaced,” though four witnesses had testified to them about its existence and the alleged plot by Kelly’s team to get it back.
“I mean, the reason why we don’t have it is that you heard testimony about how Mr. Keith Murrell returned that tape to Mr. Kelly’s associates and was polygraphed and paid $100,000,” Krull said, according to the transcript. “So the reason we don’t have that tape is because it was returned to Mr. Kelly.”
The tape’s absence loomed large at trial, where defense attorneys questioned whether it existed at all, and characterized Van Allen, Murrell, and Freeman as liars and extortionists.
The trial jury ultimately acquitted all three men of the conspiracy and obstruction counts.

Prosecutors at one point showed grand jurors evidence about Kelly’s illegal marriage to his 15-year-old protegee Aaliyah.
As Krull presented the case to grand jurors, one of them asked why they weren’t charging Kelly with abusing Aaliyah.
“I don’t mean this in a disrespectful way or anything,” the juror said, according to the transcript. “When you first brought us evidence, you showed us the marriage license with him and Aaliyah … so I was wondering why she wouldn’t be part of it if he married her when she was a minor and abused her?”
Kelly married Aaliyah in 1994, Krull explained, but the law under which they were charging Kelly -- enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity -- didn’t exist until 1996. The marriage was quietly annulled, and the Aaliyah was killed in a plane crash in 2001.
Still unclear is why Chicago grand jurors were shown evidence related to Aaliyah if prosecutors ended up not charging him with any conduct related to her. During the trial, U.S District Judge Harry Leinenweber barred any mention their relationship, while defense attorneys were allowed to paint a picture of Aaliyah’s uncle, Barry Hankerson, as a vindictive control freak out to destroy Kelly’s career.
Kelly did face charges related to the illegal marriage at his 2021 trial in Brooklyn’s federal court, where jurors found Kelly guilty of a wide-ranging racketeering scheme. The judge in that case sentenced the singer in June to 30 years in prison.

Prosecutors were hopeful that private investigator Jack Palladino would come in to testify or give a statement to the grand jury — but he was killed during a botched robbery outside his home in San Francisco.
At trial, Freeman told jurors a wildly memorable tale about how Palladino, a famous private eye based in California, was part of a scheme by McDavid and other Kelly associates to pay him up to a million dollars to hunt down Video 4, which he said had surfaced with some people in Atlanta.
Among the evidence backing up Freeman’s story was a written contract he and Palladino signed in August 2001 promising $100,000 plus expenses for Freeman if he recovered a “performance tape” of Kelly’s.
Krull told the grand jury in 2020 the contract had only recently been obtained after subpoenaing Palladino, who was also an attorney, and working through “all the special rules” that apply when an attorney is asked to turn over records.
Krull said they were still following up on leads from the documents and conducting interviews, and that the grand jury might hear more testimony about them in the future, including from Palladino himself.
“We are going through his records and determining whether whether or not he will come and sit for an interview, and if so then well determine whether he will come and testify,” Krull said, according to the transcript. “So that’s a possibility.”
But that apparently never happened. On Jan. 26, 2021, Palladino, 76, fell and hit his head on the sidewalk while tussling with would-be robbers outside his home in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood and never regained consciousness. Two men were arrested and are awaiting trial on murder charges.
In the end, Palladino’s records may have actually turned out to be more of a help for the defense than a smoking gun for prosecutors.
At trial, McDavid’s attorneys were able to show the jury some of Palladino’s memos labeling Freeman’s contact with the team “Kelly extortion,” as well as other business records appearing to show the private eye traveled alone to Kansas City to meet with Freeman, contradicting Freeman’s testimony that McDavid was there too.

Prosecutors learned only after indicting Kelly that one of his accusers was not actually underage during her first sexual encounter with the singer.
Van Allen, who was a key prosecution witness at the trial, told the federal grand jury in 2019 that she was 17 when she met Kelly at a music video shoot – the same claim she had made repeatedly in previous years, including as a prosecution witness in Kelly’s 2008 Cook County trial. She became “Minor 2″ in the initial Chicago federal indictment, which charged Kelly with abusing her.
But after that, Krull told jurors in 2020, a federal investigator tried to nail down the date of the video shoot. It was apparently the first time any authorities attempted to independently verify Van Allen’s age at the time she met Kelly. The person who owned the house where the video was shot still had records of the rental, which showed it was filmed just after Van Allen had turned 18, Krull told grand jurors.
So “Minor 2″ was dropped from the indictment, becoming instead “Individual D” – a cooperating witness. But Krull told the panel Van Allen “is very important still to the indictment with respect to the obstruction of justice allegations.”
Van Allen testified at length during Kelly’s trial, saying she had been mistaken when she said she was 17. Defense attorneys seized on the discrepancy to paint her as a liar and opportunist. In the end, jurors acquitted Kelly and his co-defendants on the charges related to Van Allen’s testimony.

The minor victim who was added to the superseding indictment had told the grand jury Kelly first sexually abused her in New York. But that never came out at trial.
At the grand jury meeting, Krull said they were adding a new victim to the charges who was a schoolmate of Kelly’s goddaughter and was also alleged to have been sexually abused by the singer multiple times when she was a minor.
“One of them in particular, the very first one, happened on a trip to New York City that she described an encounter happened in New York City at a hotel there,” Krull said in her presentation to the grand jury. “Then she described many other encounters with Mr. Kelly, all happening when she was under 18. And so because of that we are adding her to the indictment.”
Krull said the abuse continued after the victim, who at trial went by the pseudonym “Brittany,” became legally an adult, “but for purposes of this charge we’re only focusing on the conduct that happened to her when she was under 18.”
At trial, prosecutors promised jurors that they’d hear directly from Brittany. But she was never called as a witness for reasons unexplained.
Instead, jurors were asked to rely on testimony from other witnesses, including Jane, who said Kelly engaged her in threesomes with Brittany between five and 10 times. Another victim, Pauline, told the jury that Kelly also had threesomes with her and Brittany when Pauline was 15 or 16, and said Brittany is about a year older than her.
Pauline said that when she was 20, she called Kelly’s business posing as Brittany and threatened to go public about some wrongdoing if he didn’t give her money.
“Well, he called it extortion,” Pauline told the jury. “I called it ‘don’t play with me.’
But Brittany’s absence did not go unnoticed by the jury, which acquitted Kelly of the enticement counts related to her accusations.

"Cipollone, Loeffler testify before Georgia grand jury: report","Former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) have testified before the Georgia grand jury probing efforts by former President Trump and his allies to overturn the state’s 2020 presidential election results, according to a new CNN report.
The outlet reported that Cipollone and Loeffler both testified before the grand jury in recent months.
The pair join a number of figures in Trump’s orbit subpoenaed by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D) as part of a sweeping investigation into potential election interference in Georgia and attempts to keep the former president in power.
Former top White House counsel Cipollone was separately subpoenaed earlier this year by both the Justice Department and the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, sought after for his insight on key meetings with Trump and his allies. The attorney was reportedly privy to discussions on the Trump camp’s efforts to push its voter fraud claims.
Loeffler, who lost last year’s runoff race in Georgia to Sen. Raphael Warnock (D), notably turned away from Trump in the immediate aftermath of Jan. 6. Initially planning to certify Georgia’s election results against then-candidate Biden, Loeffler said she could not “in good conscience object” to Biden’s victory after the riotous violence.
The CNN report notes the grand jury proceedings are not public, and that it’s not currently clear what exactly the probe hoped to learn from the testimony.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) and conservative lawyers John Eastman, Jenna Ellis and Cleta Mitchell have all been subpoenaed as part of the Georgia special grand jury probe, though many have fought their calls to appear.
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani testified earlier this year after being told he was a target in the probe.

Kelly zoekt na vader Peter R. de Vries door naar vermiste Germa,"Kelly de Vries, de dochter van misdaadverslaggever Peter R. de Vries, zoekt nadat haar vader daarmee was begonnen, verder naar Germa van den Boom. De 19-jarige raakte bijna veertig jaar geleden vermist en is nooit teruggevonden.
""Hij vond dit een bijzondere zaak en zag de potentie om het op te lossen"", zegt Kelly donderdagavond in de talkshow Jinek over haar vader en de vermissingszaak uit 1984. ""Het is heel heftig dat ze nog steeds geen antwoorden hadden, hij wilde het voor hun oplossen.""
De Peter R. de Vries Foundation, voorheen Stichting De Gouden Tip, heeft een beloning van 250.000 euro uitgeloofd aan degene met cruciale informatie over waar Germa mogelijk kan worden gevonden. Kelly, die directeur is van de organisatie, benadrukt dat een tip meer moet leiden naar Germa en niet zozeer naar de dader. ""Het belangrijkste is dat we haar terug kunnen vinden en het een plekje kunnen geven"", zegt Germa's zus Conny.
De organisatie geeft mensen een halfjaar om iets van zich te laten horen over de zaak. ""We willen mensen ertoe zetten om te gaan praten. Anders denken de mensen misschien 'ik praat over een paar jaar wel'."" En dat werkt, meent Kelly, want, zegt ze: ""We zagen bij de zaak rondom Tanja Groen dat er in de laatste 24 uur bijna net zoveel tips binnen kwamen als in de maanden daarvoor.""",2022-10-20T21:02:55Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen
R. Kelly’s Former Business Manager Seeking $850K in Attorney’s Fees,"R. Kelly’s former business manager asked a federal judge to award him $850,000 in attorneys fees after a jury acquitted him during the same trial in Chicago at which the R&B singer was convicted of child pornography charges.
Derrel McDavid’s attorney wrote that deserves to recoup the legal fees after enduring a “frivolous, vexatious and bad faith prosecution over which he prevailed.” Attorney Beau Brindley filed the 18-page request with U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber late Monday (Oct. 17), the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
A federal jury last month convicted Kelly of producing child pornography and enticing minor girls for sex, but found Kelly and McDavid not guilty of conspiring to rig a 2008 trial in which Kelly was acquitted on state child pornography charges. A third co-defendant, Milton Brown, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Such motions are exceedingly rare and do not often succeed, in large part because defendants who are acquitted of criminal charges do not have a right to compensation. In his motion, Brindley said prosecutors knew the testimony of two key witnesses was “necessarily incoherent.”
“This is, by definition, a reckless disregard for the truth, which constitutes a frivolous and vexatious position by the government,” he wrote. “This entitles Mr. McDavid to reasonable attorney’s fees.”
During the trial, prosecutors maintained there was compelling evidence that McDavid was aware that Kelly was producing child pornography and that he sought for years to conceal evidence of what Kelly was doing.
Brindley said McDavid still owes $600,000 in legal fees and “must now liquidate real property and other assets in an attempt to pay.” Brindley also wrote that he and others spent at least 1,220 hours working on the case and that adds up to about $65,000 less than what a “reasonable market rate” of $750 an hour would cost a client.

Isaiah Washington Claims Aaliyah Wasn’t R. Kelly’s Victim,"Actor Isaiah Washington sat down for an interview with VladTV this week, where she shared his thoughts on his Romeo Must Die co-star Aaliyah, who secretly married R. Kelly in 1994 when she was only 15 and the “Ignition” singer was 27.

During R. Kelly’s racketeering and sex trafficking trial in 2021, the singer’s tour manager Demetrius Smith shared that he had reason to believe Kelly had impregnated Aaliyah when she was still a minor, which is why they got married. The marriage was later annulled in February 1995. Aaliyah died tragically just a few years later, in 2001 at age 22, in an airplane accident in the Bahamas.
While many believe that Kelly preyed on the late star when she was just a teenager, Washington claimed in the interview that she was not a victim. He admitted that he had a “crush” on the then-21-year-old “mysterious” singer while filming Romeo Must Die, in part to her being so “mature.”
As far as the R. Kelly relationship, Washington said that he believes she was in control due to her mature personality. “She was very in control of her being, but she was a businesswoman too. Super smart,” he said. “I think she was in control of that situation even at her age.”
“She was 15 going on 30, so she was in control of that whole situation,” he later added. “I don’t judge her, but she was very smart and very mature and very in control of her situation. I don’t believe one minute that Aaliyah was made to do anything that Aaliyah didn’t want to do.”

(Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune)
A month after winning a stunning acquittal on all charges, the attorney for R. Kelly’s former business manager Derrel McDavid has filed an unusual request to force the government to pony up McDavid’s nearly million-dollar legal tab as penalty for bringing a case that he says was “vexatious, frivolous and in bad faith.”
The long-shot motion filed Tuesday by attorney Beau Brindley alleged the evidence against McDavid was “irreconcilably conflicted and incoherent,” and that he deserves payment after successfully defending himself against a “capricious and overzealous prosecution.”

McDavid incurred $850,000 in legal fees, most of which has not been paid, and he has been left to try to liquidate real estate and other assets in an attempt to make up the difference, Brindley stated in the 18-page filing.
McDavid was paid millions as Kelly’s longtime associate, according to trial testimony. He is a professional accountant who also managed other celebrities, and co-owns the popular River North restaurant Mercadito.

After a hotly contested monthlong trial, a jury of seven women and five men acquitted McDavid, 61, of all counts alleging he conspired with Kelly and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, to buy back incriminating videotapes of the singer sexually abusing underage girls and rig his 2008 child pornography trial in Cook County. Brown was also acquitted of the single count against him.
The verdict was split, however, as the jury convicted Kelly on child pornography charges for making three videotapes of himself sexually abusing his then-14-year-old goddaughter beginning in the late 1990s, as well as sexual misconduct with two other minors around the same time period. His sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 23.

The conspiracy charges in the prosecution’s case hinged in large part on the word of two witnesses — Charles Freeman and Lisa Van Allen — whom defense attorneys repeatedly characterized as liars and extortionists.
In his motion Tuesday, Brindley argued that prosecutors allowed Van Allen and Freeman to tell the jury “a story that had to be false” based on the testimony of other witnesses and their own prior sworn statements.
“These witnesses provided the essence of the case against Mr. McDavid,” Brindley wrote. “And the government knew their combined testimony was necessarily incoherent. This is, by definition, a reckless disregard for the truth, which constitutes a frivolous and vexatious position by the government.”
Brindley also publicly filed several attachments to his motion, including lengthy transcripts of grand jury hearings that by law are supposed to be kept secret. Those attachments were later placed under seal.
It’s extremely rare for a judge to grant the type of relieve Brindley requested, particularly in a case as heavily litigated as Kelly’s. U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber previously ruled in favor of prosecutors on several motions seeking to dismiss counts in the indictment.
Prosecutors have not yet responded to Brindley’s allegations.

Megyn Kelly urges Tulsi Gabbard to run for president with Kristi Noem,"Megyn Kelly urged former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to join forces with Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem in a 2024 White House bid, joking that it would be “the best-looking ticket ever.”
Gabbard, the former Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate, appeared on Kelly’s SiriusXM podcast, “The Megyn Kelly Show,” on Friday, just days after she announced that she was leaving the Democratic Party.
Kelly asked Gabbard, who is officially an independent, if she considered “throwing your hat in the presidential ring for the other side” — alluding to the Republican Party.
She then played a clip of a June interview she did with Noem, who is said to be friends with Gabbard.
“I got a little sexist in my commentary, but you won’t be offended,” Kelly told Gabbard before playing a clip in which she tells the South Dakota governor that a presidential ticket with the two of them would be “the best-looking ever.”
Noem told Kelly on her June 28 podcast that she and Gabbard would “work out together” when they were both members of Congress and that she discussed with her the possibility of “doing messaging together.”

“The thought of you and Tulsi Gabbard on the same ticket together someday is too much to bear,” Kelly told Noem.
“That would be amazing,” the podcaster continued. “A, because it would be the best-looking ticket ever.”
Kelly also mentioned that the two combine considerable “brainpower” and that Gabbard “is just a reasonable person.”
Noem told Kelly that, like Gabbard, she has “scar tissue” after “being beat up” by both the left and the right.
Kelly then cut to the interview with Gabbard, who said that Noem “is a dear friend.”
Noem spoke warmly of her friendship with Gabbard during a June interview with Kelly. AP
Gabbard recalled that she and Noem routinely “worked out regularly with our bipartisan workout group in Washington.”
“I respect her for the reasons she talked about,” Gabbard said, calling their relationship a “friendship based on respect [and] that’s personal as well as professional.”
Gabbard said she and Noem share “values and principles.”
“I have no idea what the future holds,” Gabbard said, addressing a potential presidential run.
“Kristi and I are keeping in touch and we’ll continue to find ways to help, however we can, to bridge the divides in America right now,” she said.

Gabbard told Kelly that her decision to leave the party was due to it being “controlled by fanatic ideologues” who have abandoned the principles of “civil liberties and free speech” by “partnering with Big Tech to censor” their opponents.
“They don’t stand for freedom, they don’t believe in the Constitution, and they’re actively seeking to undermine our God-given rights enshrined in the Constitution [such as] freedom of speech [and] freedom of religion,” Gabbard said of the Democrats.
Gabbard said she was put off by Democratic tactics of “smear and destroy,” particularly when she expressed her foreign policy views.
“It got to the point where this is a party that I can no longer associate myself with because of the danger and threat that it poses to our country, to our democracy,” she said.",2022-10-14T18:56:29Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
Killer dentist Colin Howell gets in prison row with rapist over scratched R Kelly CD,"Driller killer Colin Howell got a behind bars “tongue-lashing” from murdering rapist Kristoff Alauya — for scratching his R Kelly CD.
Prison insiders watched in amusement as the deadly duo and convicted sex offenders, who have become close pals through the church, had a blazing barney over the damaged music disc – ironically featuring a singer who was recently jailed for 30 years for sex abuse.
Nigerian immigrant Kristoff Emmanuel Alauya (38) is serving a minimum 22-year life sentence for the rape and murder of 38-year-old Belfast mum-of-one Grace Moore.
Howell (63) is serving a minimum life sentence of 21 years for the murder of his own wife and his lover’s husband plus another five-and-a-half years for a string of sickening sex attacks on a number of women.

Sources say the pair have become an unlikely jailhouse “power couple” who seek out and target new inmates at Braid House in Maghaberry Prison and bombard them with religious teachings.
But there was trouble in the ‘Garden of Eden’ after Howell’s careless compact disc scratching.

“Kristoff and Colin Howell have become close mates in recent years through religion, but they had a big bust-up recently,” says an insider.
“And it all started over R Kelly and one of his CDs. Kristoff is a big fan of his music – maybe that’s not a surprise knowing what we know now – and he wanted to share his passion with Colin.
“You’d hardly think Bible-basher Colin would be into R&B but he gave it a go and took up Kristoff’s offer. But he accidentally scratched it.
“He didn’t realise and gave it back to Kristoff who went nuts when it wouldn’t play properly.
“He marched straight over to Colin and gave him a tongue-lashing. You could see them arguing about it through a glass window. Kristoff has a notoriously bad temper and he seemed to lose it over something which would seem fairly small to anyone on the outside.”

“They then pull them into a cell and bombard them with the workings of God and how he has forgiven them for their sins. They know these people are vulnerable so they try and indoctrinate them and actually tell them how they should behave inside prison.
“Both of them are in privileged positions because they are well behaved and so have the run of the place to some extent.
“The Prison Service turn a blind eye to it, thinking it’s harmless, but some people think they should be stopped because it must be very intimidating to arrive in prison and then be accosted by these two killers telling you what to do!”

Raubkopie von unveröffentlichtem Album von R. Kelly aufgetaucht,"Der 55-jährige Musiker R. Kelly war im vergangenen Juni wegen schwerer Sexualverbrechen zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt worden. (Archivbild) Keystone
Auf den Plattformen Spotify und Apple Music ist am Freitag ein bislang unveröffentlichtes Album des wegen Sexualdelikten inhaftierten US-Musikers R. Kelly aufgetaucht. Medienberichten zufolge handelt es sich vermutlich um eine Raubkopie.
Laut dem Promi-Portal «TMZ» enthielt das Album 13 Stücke, darunter auch den 19-minütigen Titelsong «I Admit It», den der frühere R&B-Star 2018 vor seiner Inhaftierung auf dem Online-Musikdienst SoundCloud veröffentlicht hatte.
Wenige Stunden nach den ersten Berichten von «TMZ» und «Hollywood Reporter» war das Album von beiden Plattformen wieder verschwunden. Ein Vertreter von Sony Music, dem die Rechte an Kellys Musik gehören, sagte dem Magazin «Variety», das Album sei inoffiziell veröffentlicht worden – was laut «Variety» bedeutet, dass es sich um eine Raubkopie handelt.
Nach Angaben von Kellys Anwältin Jennifer Bonjean stehen weder der Sänger noch sein Umfeld hinter der Veröffentlichung. Vielmehr sei ihr Mandant seines «geistigen Eigentums beraubt» worden. Spotify reagierte zunächst nicht auf eine Bitte der Nachrichtenagentur AFP um eine Stellungnahme.
Der mit dem Hit «I Believe I Can Fly» zum Star gewordene Musiker war im vergangenen Juni von einem Gericht in Brooklyn wegen schwerer Sexualverbrechen zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt worden. Bei einem weiteren Prozess in Chicago wurde der 55-Jährige im September wegen Kinderpornografie schuldig gesprochen, ihm droht dem 55-Jährigen eine weitere lange Gefängnisstrafe.

Twice-convicted R&B singer R. Kelly’s first hearing in Cook County court after his Chicago federal trial left observers with little clarity about how the lingering county cases would proceed.
Thursday’s hearing was four minutes. Kelly, who is in federal custody awaiting sentencing, was not present. Attorneys got admonishments from Associate Judge Lawrence Flood that they should “start looking toward a resolution of these matters or trial.”

Assistant State’s Attorney Tene McCoy Cummings said in court that prosecutors were in the process of ordering and reading transcripts from Kelly’s Chicago federal trial, which concluded in mid-September. That review will help them file the appropriate motions in the county cases, she said.
Kelly’s attorney Steven Greenberg, meanwhile, told Flood he believes prosecutors should dismiss the cases altogether.

Flood said he would continue to have attorneys return to court each month for hearings, and if any substantive matters are scheduled, he will require Kelly’s appearance in court for them.
Greenberg months ago filed a formal request to throw out one of the County cases. That motion has yet to be argued. He said in court Thursday he intends to file a similar request on one of the other cases. Kelly’s next court date was set for mid-November.

Kelly was convicted in Chicago federal court last month on charges including child pornography related to his years of sexual abuse of his underage goddaughter and other girls. He was acquitted, however, of the explosive allegations that he rigged his initial Cook County trial in the 2000s. Sentencing in that case is scheduled for February.
Kelly already was sentenced to 30 years in a separate case, after a jury in New York found him guilty of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging his musical career doubled as a criminal enterprise aimed at satisfying his predatory sexual desires.
But the Cook County charges were filed before either federal case. In four separate indictments, county prosecutors allege Kelly sexually abused or assaulted four people, three of whom were underage girls at the time.
The federal charges soon overshadowed the county cases, which were largely put on hold.
Meanwhile, Kelly is fighting on at least three other fronts where prosecutors and civil attorneys are going after his money.
Last month, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York ruled that Kelly must pay one of the sexual abuse victims in his New York racketeering conviction, “Jane,” about $300,000 in restitution to cover herpes treatments and projected costs of her ongoing psychological therapy.

Donnelly ruled that another victim who testified against Kelly in that 2021 trial, “Stephanie,” should also be compensated by Kelly for her herpes treatment and psychological treatment, but the judge has yet to determine an amount.

The restitution to Jane and Stephanie will come on top of about $140,000 in fines and other assessments Kelly already owes in that case.
To help pay for it, Donnelly in August ordered nearly $30,000 in Kelly’s prison commissary account seized and placed in an interest-bearing account controlled by the U.S. District Court clerk. One of Kelly’s attorneys, Jennifer Bonjean, is appealing that order.
In his Chicago federal case, prosecutors will be seeking forfeiture of up to $1.5 million from Kelly when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber in February.
Following his conviction on child pornography charges last month, the Tribune reported that a $4 million default judgment had been entered against the singer in a lawsuit filed by a woman alleging Kelly had sexually abused her beginning when she was 16. Kelly is appealing the judge’s ruling in that case.

Masters faces high stakes at Arizona Senate debate,"Arizona Senate hopeful Blake Masters (R) faces a critical moment with this week’s televised debate against Sen. Mark Kelly (D) as he seeks to turn around his struggling campaign.
The past several weeks have seen prospects dimming for Masters, who has struggled to break through amid concerns over his hard-right views and the decision from a super PAC with ties to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to yank millions of dollars of spending from the race.
Now with less than five weeks to go before the midterms, Republicans are hoping Masters, who has the backing of former President Trump, can use the opportunity to appeal to a broader swath of voters in a race that is seen as crucial to flipping the upper chamber.
“Blake is a real smart guy, that is not in dispute,” said GOP strategist Barrett Marson, who’s previously worked on Masters’s campaign. “However, he has made some gaffes in the recent past that have not helped him, so just hoping he practices. Practice, practice, practice. And that he has his talking points and that he’s scripted.”
Masters, a venture capitalist with ties to GOP megadonor Peter Thiel, leaned into the culture wars before and even after the primary, falsely claiming children were being taught to be transgender and slamming Democrats over their “diversity obsession.” He’s taken heat for his past comments on issues like abortion and gun violence, including when he claimed that abortion rights advocates saw the medical procedure as a “religious sacrifice” and for suggesting that Black people were the cause of gun violence.
Post-primary, Masters’s campaign scrubbed some of his far-right stances from his website and made attempts at moderating his messaging. But recent polling shows that tactic might not be working among voters.
“… The primary was such a narrow band when compared to the general election population of likely voters that what Mitch McConnell said and meant, talking about poor candidate selection, we’re seeing on the ground here,” said Kevin DeMenna, an Arizona Republican consultant and longtime supporter of former Rep. Matt Salmon (Ariz.), who lost the GOP nomination for governor this year.
Republicans and political observers also point to the wide cash advantage that Kelly holds over Masters. Kim Fridkin, a foundation professor for the School of Politics and Global Studies at Arizona State University, said that the financial advantage has allowed Kelly to define himself early on in the race, especially given that the former NASA astronaut didn’t have a primary challenger.
“Masters is pretty much an unknown in the state, I would say still, and so he didn’t really get a chance to define himself, and that I think is problematic,” she said.
Republicans see the debate as an important platform for Masters to make his case to voters and contrast himself with Kelly. But time is running out, as early voting in the state starts Oct. 12 and Election Day is less than five weeks away.
“Blake Masters has the issues in his favor. He’s a very intelligent and successful guy. The debate offers him a chance to hammer Mark Kelly on the issues that Arizonans know he has failed them on, namely inflation, border security, and crime. If he does that effectively, and we know he will, he will see a nice bounce coming out of Thursday night,” said T.W. Arrighi, national press secretary for Senate Republicans’ campaign arm.
Masters needs to use the debate to appeal to moderates and split-ticket voters, Republicans say.
“The message that Blake Masters needs to deliver has to have appeal to the middle, the Arizona centrist voter, and it has to be authentic,” DeMenna said.
Winning the support of unaffiliated voters in Arizona in particular will be critical for both candidates. Data as of August from the Arizona secretary of state’s office shows that Republicans and voters listed as “other” make up roughly the same percentage of voters in the state — 34.5 percent and 33.7 percent, respectively. Democrats follow closely behind, at about 31 percent.
Some polling shows Kelly leading Masters by as much as double digits among the independent voter bloc. A Marist Poll released last week found that Kelly led Masters 51 percent to 34 percent among independent voters alone, while another poll released last month by OH Predictive Insights found the senator receiving 43 percent of support among independents, while Masters only received 28 percent.
A CBS News-YouGov Battleground Tracker survey released Wednesday showed Masters closing the gap with independents, receiving 48 percent compared to Kelly’s 49 percent.
“When Trump selected Masters, the Trump bump paid off. The dividend that it paid was his winning that primary,” DeMenna said. “At this point, the Arizona electorate is divided into the thirds, one-third is Republican. And frankly, only half of that is what it takes to win that primary, but not what it takes to have general election appeal.”
Masters’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
In a sign that Republicans have renewed their efforts in the race, CNBC reported that Thiel suggested to guests during a fundraising event that he hosted at his home in Los Angeles for Masters that he would be helping the Republican candidate, though it’s uncertain how.
Trump is also returning to the state on Sunday to give a boost to his endorsees in the state, including Masters, gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake (R) and others. Republicans see sharing the stage with the former president as an important moment for Masters and one that will increase media attention of the candidate, but some acknowledge Trump may focus the rally on past grievances instead of the midterms.
Democrats, for their part, see Trump’s visit as a sign of weakness.
“The fact that Trump feels like he has to come here a month out from Election Day shows you where the race is,” said one Democratic strategist.
The same strategist noted that the “relitigation of the Big Lie — that’s 100 percent going to be the focus of Trump while he’s there. And so Masters will have be back to defending that, and I think that’s not helpful.”
Arizona Democratic consultant Bill Scheel agreed that the former president’s presence in the state would not be helpful to Masters, suggesting that “the more it’s about Trump, the worse for him.”
Others are also unconvinced that Thursday’s debate will move the needle with voters. Fridkin, the professor, said it’s unlikely many will tune into the debate and suggested that Kelly would need to have a “problematic performance” in order for the dynamic to shift.
Debate aside, Republicans still think Masters has a shot at the seat but acknowledge it’s coming down to the wire.
“I think Blake has to be buoyed by the fact that there has been, again, tens of billions of dollars spent on him on TV. I can’t turn on the TV without seeing either a pro-Kelly or anti-Blake Masters ad, and yet he’s still within striking distance,” said Marson, the GOP strategist.
“He’s had a couple of fundraisers that brought in probably decent money, so he’s up with his own ads as well,” he also said of Masters. “You know, it’s not too late. But the clock is getting closer to midnight.”",2022-10-06T10:00:00Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
Filmmaker dream hampton says that #MeToo is in 'the backlash phase',"dream hampton wishes she could be more optimistic these days.
The filmmaker and activist could be taking a well-deserved victory lap right now. In 2019, she executive produced the intense and damning Surviving R. Kelly, a Lifetime documentary series about the popular R&B singer—and the decades of accusations that he sexually abused Black women and girls. Kelly had evaded most consequences until after the #MeToo movement went viral, and several of the abuse survivors went public in hampton’s documentary—leading to a long-delayed but decisive reckoning. This June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison, for sex trafficking and federal racketeering; just last month, another jury found him guilty on charges of child pornography and sex abuse.
But when I interviewed hampton in early September, for Fortune’s new feature on the five-year anniversary of #MeToo going viral, she was preoccupied with something else that had happened in June: The Supreme Court’s ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating the federal protection for U.S. women’s right to have an abortion. More than 20 million women have already lost access to reproductive health care as a result of the ruling—and hampton, who’s been “a Black feminist for my whole adult life,” sees the court’s decision as part of a larger reaction to #MeToo and the overall “Sisyphean nature” of working towards racial and gender equity.
“We are certainly in the backlash phase,” she says. “I just didn’t think I would live in a world where Roe would be overturned.”
Even when it comes to Kelly and his long-delayed legal comeuppance, hampton isn’t exactly exulting—in part because she’s a longtime critic of the U.S. criminal justice system and its structural racism.
“I have organized against the carceral system, against our system of punishment, for a very long time,” she says. “And I think it might have been even more meaningful if R. Kelly had apologized. If there had been contrition, and restitution, he would have actually changed the culture.”
In the following conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, hampton reflects on the complicated legacy of, and backlash to, #MeToo—including the recent celebrity trial that turned into the “biggest public flogging I’ve ever seen.”
Fortune: It’s been five years since #MeToo went viral, and more than 16 years since Tarana Burke first coined the phrase “me too” to support women and girls of color who survived sexual abuse. How do you think about the movement’s legacy today?
hampton: The thing about #MeToo was that it wasn’t just saying, “Only speak up if you experienced severe violence, rape, and trauma.” It was a wide-open conversation. So many stories were nested under that hashtag—about all of the gaslighting that happens in corporate or educational spaces, or whatever spaces you enter—and there were all these women sharing the things that they’d experienced, and being validated.
There was a real calling out and naming of names. That has been how we’ve organized around racial justice—we didn’t just say “Corporations are supporting apartheid,” we named those corporations—but we’d not seen this kind of naming of individual men before.
How much did #MeToo going viral help Surviving R. Kelly have an impact, after he’d avoided consequences for so many public accusations in the past?
I don’t know about #MeToo. But R. Kelly was a genre artist, who sings Black music for Black people, and Black Twitter is a force. I was mocked in meetings, by the people in charge, when I told them that we better have a Twitter campaign [for promoting the documentary]. Which was insane, because at that point there was a Twitter president! But they were like, “Do not listen to dream and her Black Twitter talk.” [laughs]
And so [Lifetime executive] Brie Bryant thankfully got together a social media plan that involved identifying leaders in the space, people like [Black feminist writers and activists] Feminista Jones and Mikki Kendall, who appears in the doc. These are people who have set conversations on this space for more than a decade at this point. It was Black Twitter, and not #MeToo, that made R. Kelly a story.
Given what you’ve said elsewhere about R. Kelly’s prison sentence, is it fair to call your reaction ambivalence?
Yeah, absolutely. I have organized against the carceral system, against our system of punishment, for a very long time. And I think it might have been even more meaningful if R. Kelly had apologized; if there had been contrition, and restitution, he would have actually changed the culture. That would have been more meaningful than a prison sentence, where you continue to have fans and other powerful people in the community who tell you that you’re innocent.
After a sentence of 30 years, what do you expect out of his second trial [which, a week after this conversation, resulted in a guilty conviction on several counts of child pornography and sex abuse]?
I thought it was interesting that they went forward with it. Usually when you get a conviction, other states just decide to drop the case. But given the reversal of Bill Cosby’s conviction, maybe someone thought, “Perhaps we should fortify this.”
Have you seen any progress, in terms of infrastructure or support or just a more receptive environment, for assault survivors who come forward today?
I don’t know. I mean, I watched the Amber Heard–Johnny Depp trial. [Heard, Depp’s former wife, had described herself after their marriage ended as a survivor of “domestic abuse”; Depp sued her for defamation, in an ugly and widely publicized trial, and won.] If I’m a young survivor, I’m watching how Amber Heard became this kind of shorthand—and this is a young, beautiful, blonde, white woman, you know? I mean, yes, our girls got dragged and doxxed and abused by the public. But I think that the trial was probably the biggest public flogging that I’ve seen. And that is part of this about-face.
We are certainly in the backlash phase. It’s painful to be in this phase. I just didn’t think I would live in a world where Roe would be overturned. All of these things are connected; all of these things are about restricting the progress that women have made. I wish we could say that we were marching toward freedom, as opposed to fighting for abortion rights.",2022-10-06T04:00:00Z,https://fortune.com,Fortune

R. Kelly Ordered to Pay Restitution to Victims He Exposed to STDs,"As R. Kelly awaits sentencing in his Chicago child pornography trial, he now has to figure out a way to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to his victims. Several women have testified in his Brooklyn trial that he exposed them to STDs without revealing his status ahead of time. Now, a judge has ordered the disgraced R&B singer to pay the victims, and has yet to determine the final amount.

Judge orders R. Kelly to pay restitution for exposing victims to STDs
Stemming from his Brooklyn criminal racketeering case in which Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison, TMZ reports there was a restitution hearing where a judge is ordering him to fork over an estimated $300k to his victims. During the hearing, the judge demanded that Kelly will have to cover treatment related to herpes, as well as psychological care that “Jane” apparently requires.

The same was granted for another victim listed as “Stephanie,” though a judge has yet to determine how much she will receive. A third victim, listed as “Sonja,” was denied restitution.
During the Brooklyn case, a physician testified that he began treating Kelly for herpes around 2007. Kelly did not testify at either the Brooklyn or Chicago trial.
One victim has spoken publicly about having herpes
One of Kelly’s former girlfriends has spoken multiple times publicly about contracting herpes during her relationship with him. Faith Rodgers met Kelly when she was just 19 backstage at a concert and began dating him. She says their relationship lasted for a year.
Within that time, Rodgers claims Kelly would lock her up when she didn’t sexually please him to his liking. She also accused him of videotaping their intimate moments without her knowledge and consent. Rodgers says she discovered Kelly had herpes after he’d already given it to her. She eventually sued him.

Rodgers detailed her experience in the Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly. She also says she began suffering panic attacks after being threatened by Kelly and his associates to blackmail her with nude photos and videos from their sexual encounters.
During his Brooklyn trial, several other women took the stand to testify that they also contracted herpes from Kelly, including Azriel Clary. Clary was with Kelly from the ages of 17-22. She says Kelly was her only sexual partner, and she confronted him about exposing her to herpes while they were together.
Joycelyn Savage’s parents also fear that she may be exposed to herpes. However, they remain estranged from their daughter, despite Kelly being incarcerated.
The singer says he’s broke
It’s unclear how Kelly will pay the restitution ordered as his prison commissary was recently taken. ABC Chicago reports that $28,000 from the account will be issued to the Clerk of Court for the Eastern District of New York in connection to his sex trafficking conviction in the state, and used toward restitution. The money will also be used toward special assessment fees associated with the case.

"R Kelly to pay $300,000 to victim in sex crimes case","Follow us on Image Source : INSTAGRAM/MEDIAZONE.ETH R Kelly
A federal judge signalled Wednesday that she plans to order disgraced R&B superstar R.Kelly to pay more than USD 300,000 to one his victims in a decades-long scheme to use his fame to sexually abuse young fans. A restitution order by U.S.District Judge Ann Connelly that was still being finalised is meant to cover the cost of treatment for herpes and psychotherapy. The victim, referred to only by a pseudonym, has accused the jailed Kelly of giving her the sexually transmitted disease during one of their encounters.
Kelly could be on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars more to pay for herpes treatment and counseling for a second victim once the final tally is calculated. The judge rejected a third claim by another accuser.
The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling songwriter appeared at the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn via video from a lockup in Chicago, and only spoke to exchange greetings with the judge and to turn down an offer to say more. None of the victims were in attendance.
Earlier this year, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison following a trial in New York where the jury found him guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. A second trial in Chicago ended on Sept 14 with his conviction on charges of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex.
The question now in the New York case becomes when and how Kelly will pay the restitution. Prosecutors claim he has access to as much as USD 5 million to go along with about $28,000 seized from his inmate commissary account that defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean said was made up of small donations from fans.
Bonjean told the judge that Kelly has no access to any other funds because of judgments in civil cases brought against him. She also insisted that her client has always been clueless about his finances. ALSO READ: R Kelly gets engaged to his alleged sexual abuse victim, fiancé asks for leniency in sentencing
“He's not the best source of that information,” she said.
Kelly achieved superstar status for work including the 1996 hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and the cult classic “Trapped in the Closet,” a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.

The money will compensate two women for the costs of therapy and herpes treatment
NEW YORK, USA – R. Kelly, the multiplatinum R&B singer convicted twice this year of sex crimes, will be required to pay at least $300,000 in restitution to some of his victims, a federal judge said on Wednesday, September 28.
The money will compensate two women, known as Jane and Stephanie, for the costs of therapy and herpes treatment, US District Judge Ann Donnelly said at a hearing in Brooklyn.
That figure is likely to rise after prosecutors recalculate the cost of medication for Stephanie.
Donnelly denied prosecutors’ requests to compensate Jane for lost income, and provide any compensation to a third victim known as Sonja.
Kelly attended the hearing via Zoom from a federal prison in Chicago.
Donnelly sentenced Kelly in June to 30 years in prison, after a jury convicted him of racketeering and other charges.
Prosecutors said the 55-year-old Kelly exploited his stardom and wealth over more than two decades to lure women and underage girls into his orbit for sex.
The monthlong trial amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the Grammy-winning hit “I Believe I Can Fly.”
Kelly was also convicted last month in Chicago on separate charges of child pornography and luring underage girls for sex.
He is awaiting sentencing in that case, and also faces various state charges in Illinois and Minnesota.

"R. Kelly Owes Abuse Victims $300K For Herpes Treatment, Judge Says","A federal judge said Wednesday that R. Kelly will be required to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution to two victims to cover treatment for their sexually-transmitted diseases and psychological trauma.
Kelly owes at least $300,000 to a victim known as Jane for herpes treatment and psychological therapy, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly said at a hearing, and an undecided sum to another woman known as Stephanie for the same issues.
The ruling was not final, and a final figure will be determined once federal prosecutors recalculate the exact costs of care. The judge declined to order restitution to a third victim known as Sonja.
Related Shakira to Face Trial For Tax Fraud in Spain
After decades of accusations of sexual misconduct, Kelly was convicted last year in New York on racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from accusations that he orchestrated a long-running scheme to recruit and abuse women and underage girls.
In June, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $140,000 in fines, but restitution was left unresolved. Then last month, he was convicted on separate charges in Chicago, where he likely faces additional fines and restitution payments on top of a lengthy prison sentence.
With $440,000 in total payments due and likely more on the way, it’s unclear whether Kelly has the funds to pay his victims.
In April 2020, Kelly’s lawyers reportedly told a Chicago judge that he owed the IRS nearly $2 million in back taxes. And ahead of his New York trial last year, his attorneys told a judge the singer was too broke to even pay for court transcripts. Then last month, prosecutors seized $27,824 from his prison commissary funds to start paying off his debts.
Looking ahead, Kelly faces sentencing in Chicago in February. He will also soon begin the long process of appealing both convictions. Kelly’s attorney declined to comment on Wednesday’s restitution order, saying the upcoming appeal will “speak for itself.”",2022-09-28T22:50:17Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"Preso, cantor R.Kelly é condenado a indenizar suas vítimas","Reutersi Reuters - https://istoe.com.br/author/reuters/ 28/09/2022 - 18:28 Compartilhe
NOVA YORK (Reuters) – O premiado cantor norte-americano de R&B R.Kelly, condenado duas vezes neste ano por crimes sexuais, será obrigado a pagar pelo menos 300 mil dólares em indenizações a algumas de suas vítimas, disse uma juíza federal na quarta-feira.
O dinheiro compensará duas mulheres, conhecidas como Jane e Stephanie, pelos custos de terapia e tratamento de herpes, disse a juíza distrital norte-americana Ann Donnelly em uma audiência no bairro nova-iorquino do Brooklyn.
A quantia provavelmente aumentará depois que os promotores recalcularem o custo dos medicamentos para Stephanie.
Donnelly negou os pedidos dos promotores para compensar Jane pela perda de renda e para fornecer qualquer tipo de compensação a uma terceira vítima, conhecida como Sonja.
Kelly participou da audiência remotamente, a partir de uma prisão federal em Chicago.
Em junho, Donnelly condenou o cantor a 30 anos de prisão, depois que um júri o considerou culpado de extorsão e outras acusações.
Os promotores disseram que Kelly, de 55 anos, explorou seu estrelato e riqueza ao longo de mais de duas décadas para atrair mulheres e meninas menores de idade com fins sexuais.

R. Kelly moet slachtoffer betalen voor soa en psychische schade,"R. Kelly moet, naast dat hij de gevangenis in moet, zo'n 300.000 euro aan een van zijn slachtoffers betalen. Dat bedrag is vastgesteld om de kosten voor psychische hulp en behandeling van soa's te compenseren, zo meldt entertainmentwebsite TMZ.
Kelly wordt al sinds de jaren negentig beschuldigd van (kinder)misbruik. Zelf heeft hij altijd gezegd onschuldig te zijn. De zanger, die sinds 2019 vastzit, werd eind juni in New York al schuldig bevonden voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken. Hij moet nog minstens dertig jaar zitten.

R. Kelly convicted of six of 13 counts, but two associates are acquitted
A federal judge signaled Wednesday that she plans to order disgraced R&B superstar R. Kelly to pay more than $300,000 to one of his victims in a decades-long scheme to use his fame to sexually abuse young fans.
A restitution order by U.S. District Judge Ann Connelly that was still being finalized is meant to cover the cost of treatment for herpes and psychotherapy. The victim, referred to only by a pseudonym, has accused the jailed Kelly of giving her the sexually transmitted disease during one of their encounters.
Kelly could be on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars more to pay for herpes treatment and counseling for a second victim once the final tally is calculated. The judge rejected a third claim by another accuser.
The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling songwriter appeared at the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn via video from a lockup in Chicago, and only spoke to exchange greetings with the judge and to turn down an offer to say more. None of the victims were in attendance.
Earlier this year, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison following a trial in New York where the jury found him guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. A second trial in Chicago ended on Sept. 14 with his conviction on charges of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex.
The question now in the New York case becomes when and how Kelly will pay the restitution. Prosecutors claim he has access to as much as $5 million to go along with about $28,000 seized from his inmate commissary account that defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean said was made up of small donations from fans.
Bonjean told the judge that Kelly has no access to any other funds because of judgments in civil cases brought against him. She also insisted that her client has always been clueless about his finances.

R. Kelly ordered to pay victims at least $300K in restitution,"R. Kelly, the multiplatinum R&B singer convicted twice this year of sex crimes, will be required to pay at least $300,000 in restitution to some of his victims, a federal judge said on Wednesday.
The money will compensate two women, known as Jane and Stephanie, for the costs of therapy and herpes treatment, US District Judge Ann Donnelly said at a hearing in Brooklyn.
That figure is likely to rise after prosecutors recalculate the cost of medication for Stephanie.
Donnelly denied prosecutors’ requests to compensate Jane for lost income, and provide any compensation to a third victim known as Sonja.
Kelly attended the hearing via Zoom from a federal prison in Chicago.
Donnelly sentenced Kelly in June to 30 years in prison, after a jury convicted him of racketeering and other charges.

Kelly was also convicted last month in Chicago on separate charges of child pornography and luring underage girls for sex.

"R. Kelly’s fans donated nearly $28,000 to his prison commissary","R. Kelly’s superfans have put nearly $28,000 into the disgraced R&B singer’s prison commissary account, his lawyers revealed at a hearing in Brooklyn Federal Court Wednesday.
That money, which was seized to pay the fines associated with his sex trafficking conviction, will likely dry up, defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean said.

“They were people making $100 here, $100 there,” Bonjean said at a restitution hearing before Judge Ann Donnelly, as Kelly watched via Zoom call, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and a black mask.
He couldn’t make the trip from the Chicago federal jail where he’s being held because of an unspecified leg injury. Earlier this month, a Chicago federal jury convicted Kelly on three child pornography charges involving videotapes of him sexually abusing teenagers.

“He has a lot of fans,” Bonjean said after the proceedings. “They want to make his life a little easier in prison, so they make small contributions that added up over time.”
She said the fans can still make those donations, but she doubts they’ll continue. “They can do what they want, but not if the government’s gonna come and take it all. I just don’t think they will,” Bonjean said.
Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June on sex trafficking and racketeering charges in Brooklyn federal court, for a 25-year scheme that saw him sexually abuse and psychologically torture young women and men. He was also ordered to pay about $140,000 in fines immediately, but the government moved to freeze his commissary account because he hadn’t paid a dime.
Wednesday’s hearing centered on how much restitution Kelly would have to pay to three of his victims, two of whom must take expensive herpes treatments for the rest of their lives.
Bonjean challenged the restitution payments, arguing that the government would need to prove that two of the victims got herpes from Kelly, and not someone else.

“One in six people have herpes, so it is not outside the realm of possibility that this woman did not get herpes from Mr. Kelly,” the lawyer said.
She also tried to haggle over whether one of the victims — ”Jane,” who testified that the singer pulled her into his orbit at age 17 and subjected her to years of abuse — should be reimbursed hundreds of thousands of dollars for brand-name herpes medication or generic drugs.
“I don’t think it’s a matter of pursuing a less expensive treatment. It’s the same drug... The government has failed to demonstrate any need, or any expectation that she would opt for Valtrex rather than just pocket the quarter-million dollars,” Bonjean said.

Donnelly pushed back, though, saying, “Nobody has cited anything to say that the defendant can dictate the type of medicine the victim can take.”
The judge set Jane’s restitution at just over $300,000 to over medication and therapy, and told prosecutors they’d have to recalculate their restitution request for another victim, based on confusion over medication prices. A third woman is not entitled to restitution, the judge said.
Bonjean said she plans to appeal the judge’s decision.
Donnelly is still working out Kelly’s repayment schedule. His lawyers describe him as “indigent,” with his song royalties tied up by pending court judgments. Federal prosecutors have said he has a pool of $5 million still available to him.",2022-09-28T18:36:45Z,https://www.nydailynews.com,New York Daily News
"R. Kelly to Pay $309,000 in Restitution to Victims in New York Federal Case","R. Kelly is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence after being found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking in a New York federal court last year. The disgraced R&B singer has now been ordered to pay at least $309,068.18 in restitution to the victims of his sex trafficking, according to Courthouse News Service reporter Nina Pullano. Kelly also owes $140,000 in fines and assessments, according to Pullano.
As of now, $300,668.18 will go to a survivor of Kelly identified as Jane; the other $8,400 will go to a woman identified as Stephanie. According to Reuters, the money will go toward the the costs of therapy and herpes treatment for the women. The total could also rise as prosecutors determine the cost of medication for Stephanie.
In a different case, R. Kelly was recently found guilty of child pornography and obstruction charges in an Illinois federal court. He is awaiting sentencing and also faces state charges in Illinois and Minnesota.

A New York federal judge on Wednesday ordered singer R. Kelly to pay more than $300,000 in restitution to the victims of his sex trafficking and racketeering scheme.
Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is serving a 30-year sentence stemming from a decadeslong scheme of grooming girls and young women for illegal sex. He was convicted in September 2021.
At a hearing Wednesday, federal Judge Ann Donnelly ordered Kelly to pay $300,668.18 in restitution to a victim identified as Jane and $8,400 to another victim identified as Stephanie, according to CourtHouse News.
Prosecutors at his sentencing hearing in June alleged Kelly sold some of his music rights for around $5 million just before his first federal trial, arguing that the gains should be considered when the court issues him fines.
Kelly's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, countered that her client was ""pretty close to indigent"" and said she was ""not familiar with him being able to get $5 million.""
Judge Donnelly called that ""a stretch"" when she handed down the 30-year sentence and $140,000 in fines: One for $100,000 based on the conviction plus a statutory $40,000 human-trafficking penalty.
Earlier this month, Donnelly ordered for $27,828 to be seized from Kelly's prison commissary account because he had not paid any of that debt. Donnelly ordered for the money to be placed in an interest-bearing account and to be given to Kelly's victims as the first part of his restitution.
On September 14, a federal jury in Chicago also found Kelly guilty on child pornography charges after a separate trial. Sentencing in that case is scheduled for February 23, 2023.
Derrel McDavid, Kelly's former business manager, and Milton Brown, a former assistant, also stood trial for their alleged involvement in Kelly's child porn scheme. Both men were found not guilty of conspiring to receive child pornography.",2022-09-28T04:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Warnock holds 2-point lead over Walker in Georgia: survey,"Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) is currently holding a 2-point lead over Republican challenger Herschel Walker in the latest CBS News-YouGov poll.
The poll, published on Wednesday, found that 51 percent of respondents supported Warnock, who defeated former Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) in a special election last year, compared to 49 percent for Walker, who has the endorsement of former President Trump.
Walker, a former football star at the University of Georgia and in the NFL, has closed the gap against Warnock, and another poll this month placed him slightly ahead in the race.
Overall, voters had a more positive view of Warnock: 58 percent of respondents to the CBS News-YouGov poll said they had a positive view of how the Democrat handles himself professionally, compared to 42 percent who had a favorable view of Walker.
When asked to describe both candidates, 56 percent of respondents said Warnock has a strong moral character compared to 43 percent of respondents who had the same sentiment for Walker.
The former football standout has made a number of gaffes on the campaign trail, while denying reports that he hid three children he fathered with multiple women.
He downplayed himself ahead of his debate with Warnock next month, saying “I’m not that smart” — comments that his campaign argued were sarcasm.
Fifty-four percent of poll respondents said Warnock is a good role model, compared to 44 percent who said the same of Walker. And only 28 percent of respondents said Walker has the right experience for the job, compared to 52 percent for incumbent Warnock.
The Georgia Senate race is amount the most closely watched in this year’s election cycle, with control of the Senate seen as a toss up.
According to a Monmouth University poll published Wednesday, 45 percent of respondents said that they would either definitely or probably vote for Warnock, compared to the 41 percent of registered voters who said the same for Walker.
The new CBS News-YouGov poll was conducted from Sept. 14 to Sept. 19 with a total of 1,178 respondents participating in the survey. The poll’s margin of error was 4 percentage points.",2022-09-21T20:06:56Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
"Freddie Gibbs Checks Akademiks, Benny The Butcher & R.

In the two years since Freddie Gibbs released Alfredo, he's earned Grammy nominations, widespread critical acclaim, and got involved in a few beefs that are seemingly fueling his competitive nature in the booth. With SSS on the way, the rapper is reminding fans that they should expect bars from him.

Freddie Gibbs stepped in front of the mic for his inaugural Funk Flex freestyle. Following records like ""Too Much"" ft. Moneybagg Yo and ""Ice Cream"" ft. Rick Ross, Gibbs provided an unadulterated glimpse into his lyrical prowess on this one. He weaves through the soulful production of Amerie's ""Why Don't We Fall In Love,"" tackling everything from COVID-19 (Government was givin' us COVID, it was a plandemic) to the overturning of Roe v.

"Defending R. Kelly and Bill Cosby, the Same Combative Lawyer","Originally from Valparaiso, Ind., Ms. Bonjean (pronounced bon-JEEN) is a classically trained opera singer who earned a master’s degree in music and once worked at a rape crisis center in Chicago, advocating for victims of sexual violence — a stint, she said, that some might now see “as ironic.”
That job led her to study at Loyola University Chicago’s law school with the intention of becoming a prosecutor, but she ended up going into defense work after gravitating toward “underdog” clients. As a lawyer who views prosecutorial overstep as her driving force, she gained prominence by focusing on so-called wrongful conviction cases.
Russell Ainsworth, a staff attorney at the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago Law School, has worked with Ms. Bonjean on civil rights cases for a decade and said that typically, he plays the “straight guy,” while she “comes out swinging.”
“If I needed a lawyer to go to the mat for me, that’s the lawyer I would choose,” he said.
Her approach was on display earlier this year in the civil suit brought by Ms. Huth, who accused Mr. Cosby of sexually assaulting her at the Playboy Mansion in 1975, when she was 16.
During Ms. Bonjean’s cross-examination of Ms. Huth, she challenged her on why it had taken her decades to come forward with her accusation. At one point she suggested that Ms. Huth had kept quiet about the trip to the mansion, not because she had buried painful memories, but because she was uncomfortable telling people that she had gone there with Mr. Cosby because he is Black. Ms. Huth strongly denied that.",2022-09-19T14:00:09Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
EXPLAINED: Singer R Kelly Acquitted on Rigging Trial. Why?,"Federal prosecutors this week scored multiple convictions against R Kelly at the singer’s trial in Chicago, but they lost on the headline charge — that Kelly obstructed justice by rigging his 2008 state child pornography trial, at which jurors acquitted him. Kelly co-defendant and longtime business manager Derrel McDavid was also acquitted on the same count, as well as three other charges.
After the verdict, U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed disappointment in not winning convictions across the board. But he said Kelly was still looking at a prison sentence of 10 to 90 years. He said he was pleased Kelly was “finally being held accountable.”
Sentencing is set for February 23. Kelly, 55, is already serving a 30-year prison term imposed by a federal judge in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking.
At least one legal expert said obstruction of justice charges aren’t generally hard to prove. “But in this case,” said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, “the facts just weren’t there.”
Jurors also acquitted Kelly of receiving child pornography and one count of producing child pornography. He was convicted of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex. His attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, plans to appeal.
Here’s a look at the trial-fixing charge:
WHAT DID PROSECUTORS ALLEGE?
The claim was that Kelly and McDavid conspired to ensure key witnesses at the 2008 trial would lie about Kelly’s sexual abuse of girls and refuse to testify.
Prosecutors also alleged Kelly and McDavid concealed critical evidence. Witnesses at the just-ended trial described their frantic scramble to recover lost Kelly videos of himself sexually abusing girls.
They offered six — and in at least one case seven — figure payoffs in cash for the return of videos, which prosecutors said they knew would lead to a conviction in 2008.
The conspirators, said prosecutors, applied particular pressure on a girl — now 37 and referred to in federal court as “Jane” — and her parents. State and federal prosecutors said she was the girl Kelly is seen sexually abusing on a VHS tape that was at the heart of the 2008 trial.
DID THE PRESSURE WORK?
Prosecutors said it did.
Jane and her parents said they lied to a grand jury in the early 2000s about Kelly’s sexual abuse, and they didn’t testify at the 2008 trial. Jurors at that trial said they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because the victim did not testify.
“That jury was scammed. They were scammed by Robert Kelly and his fixers,” prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors this week, using Kelly’s given first name.
Federal prosecutors said the payoffs that started in the early 2000s included funding trips by Jane and her parents to the Bahamas and Cancun, Mexico.
Critically to their theory of the case, federal prosecutors also alleged Kelly intermittently paid Jane’s rent — by then in her 30s — until just several years ago to ensure she kept quiet.
WHAT WERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FOR PROSECUTORS?
Steps Kelly and others allegedly took to fix the 2008 trial happened two decades ago, so memories of how the purported crime unfolded have dimmed. At least four men who may have had direct knowledge of what happened have since died.
Among them was Jane’s father, who died a year ago.
For the child pornography count, the evidence included video that jurors saw. On enticement, they heard directly from Kelly accusers — Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. One of the enticement counts they didn’t convict him on was related to an accuser who did not testify.
WHAT WITNESSES DID PROSECUTORS CALL?
Their star witness was Jane.
On the stand, she said publicly for the first time that she was the girl in the video at the center of both the federal trial and the trial 14 years ago. She said she was 14 in the video and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
She testified she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said that it was not her. She said she wanted to protect Kelly, and added: “I also did not want that person to be me. … I was ashamed.”
Jane’s mother, who went by “Susan,” also testified. She said she lied to the state grand jury, in part because she and her husband felt threatened by Kelly and feared for their lives.
Susan said she, her husband and Kelly cried as the parents confronted Kelly about sexually abusing their daughter. While asking for forgiveness, she said Kelly also said: “You are either with us or against us.”
She took Kelly’s words as a threat. “We were very, very frightened,” she said.
Another key witness was Kelly’s ex-girlfriend Lisa Van Allen. She told jurors she stole a sex video around 2000 from a gym bag Kelly had that was full of such recordings on a rare occasion when he left it unattended.
Van Allen said McDavid told her in 2007 that she should have been killed for all the trouble she caused Kelly.
WHAT DID DEFENSE LAWYERS TELL JURORS?
They repeatedly attacked the credibility of the government’s main witnesses, noting that most testified with immunity, including Jane, her mom and Van Allen.
“They came in here to tell the government’s version of the truth,” Bonjean, Kelly’s lawyer, said.
WHAT MIGHT HAVE JURORS HAD DOUBTS ABOUT?
Kelly’s payments for Jane’s rent, what they were for and how long they lasted was critical to deciding guilt on the trial-fixing charge.
That’s because the federal statute of limitation says someone can’t be charged with such a conspiracy if it ceased within five years of an indictment.
Kelly and McDavid were indicted on that and other charges in 2019. So prosecutors had to show the conspiracy ran up to at least 2014. The rent payments to Jane after 2014, they say, was part of the continuous conspiracy.
Attorneys for Kelly and McDavid balked at the claim that the rent payments were hush money. They noted that Kelly remained friendly with Jane and her parents for many years after the 2008 trial. Jane testified, too, that she cared deeply for Kelly at least until his 2019 indictment.
Defense lawyers argued that, even if there ever was a conspiracy, it didn’t last beyond 2014.
WHAT WERE SOME OF OTHER ARGUMENTS?
Defense attorneys said several core government interpretations of things Kelly said were a stretch.
For example, they said Kelly’s remark to Jane’s parents that “you are either with us or against us” could have meant any number of things — not only that Kelly would hurt them financially or otherwise.
Bonjean also questioned why Susan continued to mix with Kelly socially for the next 20 years, if she felt so threatened.
McDavid’s lawyer, Beau Brindley, also mocked Van Allen’s claim that McDavid threatened to kill her, sarcastically referring to his client as a “murderous accountant.”

What’s next for convicted R&B singer R. Kelly,"A courtroom sketch shows defense attorneys Ashley Cohen, from left, and Jennifer Bonjean with singer R. Kelly at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago on Sept. 14, 2022. (Cheryl Cook / Chicago Tribune)
For the second time in less than a year, Chicago-born R&B singer R. Kelly finds himself convicted of serious federal child-sex crimes and staring at a lengthy prison term.
Last September, a jury in New York found him guilty of racketeering conspiracy charges alleging his musical career doubled as a criminal enterprise aimed at satisfying his predatory sexual desires — a case that resulted in a whopping 30-year sentence.

The latest conviction came in U.S. District Court in Kelly’s hometown, where a jury on Wednesday found the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer guilty of sexually abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter on videotape back in the 1990s, as well as sexual misconduct with two other minors around the same time period.
The same jury acquitted Kelly on high-profile conspiracy charges, but he still faces anywhere from 10 to 90 years in prison when he’s sentenced Feb. 23 by U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber.

Among the unanswered questions: Will the judge order that Kelly serve his sentences in Chicago and New York consecutively? That would almost certainly ensure the 55-year-old former superstar would spend the rest of his life in prison.

Also, what will become of four indictments still pending against Kelly in Cook County that were brought by State’s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2019 in the wake of the “Surviving R. Kelly” docuseries?
On top of all that, Kelly is also fighting efforts on multiple fronts to go after his money, which, according to court records, continues to flow from streaming services and other royalties.
Federal prosecutors in both Chicago and New York are asking that Kelly be forced to pay millions in restitution to victims and other penalties. Kelly also has a $4 million default judgment against him in a Cook County lawsuit filed by an accuser and is embroiled in an ongoing battle over the seizure of $30,000 in funds from his prison commissary account.
But the primary battle for his legal team now will be to try to mitigate the damage in his criminal cases and limit the total amount of time he must serve.
After the verdict was announced Wednesday at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, U.S. Attorney John Lausch said unequivocally that prosecutors plan to request Kelly’s federal sentences be served consecutively.
“When we have instances where defendants are convicted of committing horrific acts against other individuals, and it’s separate and apart from other horrific acts that he committed against other individuals, we’re asking for that (sentence) to be consecutive,” Lausch told reporters in the courthouse lobby.

Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said one of the key factors at sentencing could be the alleged conspiracy by Kelly and his co-defendants to cover up his sexual misdeeds and rig his 2008 child pornography case in Cook County.

According to federal prosecutors, Kelly pressured his goddaughter and her family to deny any abuse and paid them thousands of dollars over the years to stay quiet.
The jury on Wednesday acquitted Kelly, his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and ex-employee Milton “June” Brown on all charges related to those alleged conspiracies.
But Mariotti said prosecutors will almost surely try to bring the evidence in at sentencing as indicative of Kelly’s lack of respect for the law.
“You can bet your bottom dollar that John Lausch and his office believe that the obstruction occurred,” said Mariotti, who is now in private practice. “They wouldn’t have charged it if they didn’t. … Their view will be that this evidence is part of the history and characteristics of Mr. Kelly.”
Mariotti said that since the burden of proof is lower at a sentencing hearing as opposed to trial, prosecutors are also free to bring up “additional information and evidence” that was never charged in the indictment.
“R. Kelly is a particularly heinous defendant when you consider the wide range of conduct, the vulnerability of the victims in the case, and the damage (he) did,” Mariotti said.

Leinenweber, though, is not known as a particularly harsh sentencing judge. In fact, the 85-year-old jurist, who has been on the bench for nearly four decades, often goes out of his way to be fair to criminal defendants, often departing downward from sentencing guideline ranges if he feels they’re too harsh.
“I would not be surprised if Judge Leinenweber rejects the government’s call for consecutive sentences and determines that 30 years is enough time for Mr. Kelly,” Mariotti said.
Mariotti said that doesn’t mean the Chicago prosecution was a waste of time or taxpayer money. He said Kelly has a chance in his appeal of the rather unusual racketeering case in New York as well as the extremely harsh sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly, which was well above what even prosecutors there were asking for.
“This conviction (in Chicago) offers a chance to give additional comfort to victims that Mr. Kelly will receive justice,” Mariotti said. It also significantly changes Kelly’s “bargaining position” when trying to negotiate a deal on the pending cases.
Evidence or testimony in one case could potentially be used against him in another, which “really counts in favor of (Kelly) trying to achieve a global resolution,” he said.

The Cook County cases made a splash when they were announced in early 2019 on the heels of the explosive “Surviving R. Kelly” docuseries. Reporters mobbed Kelly as he turned himself in to the Central Police District Station, and fans played his music while they waited for him to bail out of jail after bond court.
County prosecutors hit Kelly with four separate indictments. One alleged he sexually assaulted underage Jerhonda Pace, who was a teenage superfan when they met during his 2008 trial at the Leighton Criminal Court Building at 26th and California Avenue.
Another involved new footage of Kelly allegedly sexually abusing his goddaughter, who was at the center of that trial as well as the recent federal case in Chicago. At that trial, she testified under the pseudonym “Jane.”
A third case centered on a woman identified as H.W., who accused Kelly of having sexual contact with her when she was just 16. And a fourth indictment involves an adult accuser, L.C., who said Kelly sexually abused her in 2003 when she came to braid his hair.
But all that was quickly overshadowed when federal prosecutors brought their one-two punch of indictments, and the county cases have languished ever since.
At first, the judge on Kelly’s Cook County cases, Lawrence Flood, repeatedly said the federal matters should not impede the progress of the county cases.

“I understand there’s two other matters in federal court, New York and in Chicago,” he said from the bench in December 2019. “That’s not really the concern of this court. These victims are entitled to their day in court just as the other people in the other cases.”
After saying that, he set the date for Kelly’s first Cook County trial in September 2020. That did not happen, at least partially because the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

Last year after Kelly’s conviction in New York, Foxx told the Tribune that county prosecutors agreed to remain in a “pretrial posture” while the federal cases played out.
And at a hearing for Kelly in August, Flood deliberately set the next court date for early October, when the Chicago federal trial would be over and he could get an update on how the county cases would proceed.
The allegations in two of the county indictments overlap significantly with Kelly’s federal cases. Pace was a central witness in the New York trial last year. And the video on which Cook County prosecutors based one of their cases was also at the center of his Chicago federal trial.

Greenberg filed a motion alleging that the Cook County indictment involving Pace should be thrown out, citing a provision in Illinois law that prohibits a state prosecution if the defendant has been convicted in a different jurisdiction for “the same conduct.”
Prosecutors have pushed back, saying the allegations in the New York trial were distinct from the Cook County case, even though they involve the same victim. Now that Kelly has been convicted on federal charges related to the videos, his defense might try to get that county case thrown out too.
But given the overlap, prosecutors may decide on their own to drop those cases, sparing the accusers from having to take the witness stand again. And given that Kelly might be facing the equivalent of life in prison, they might choose to drop all the county charges — or try to negotiate a plea, though Kelly so far has appeared resistant to pleading out.
Foxx said last year after Kelly’s conviction in Brooklyn that the decision about how her office would proceed would be made in consultation with the victims.
In a statement released after Wednesday’s verdict, Foxx said her office “has long combined efforts with our federal partners, and we are pleased that our collaborative efforts resulted in this conviction. We will continue this collective work in the pursuit of justice for all victims.”
“As we review next steps in the prosecution of these cases, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office will continue to prioritize public safety and support all victims of crime and we will remain a compassionate trauma informed resource for survivors as they regain their power and heal,” the statement continued.

If the cases that overlap with Kelly’s federal charges are dismissed, that would leave two other indictments still remaining: the cases involving L.C. and H.W.
The alleged incident involving L.C. occurred while Kelly was out on bond on Cook County child pornography charges. Lanita Carter has since come forward publicly, saying that she went to braid Kelly’s hair in 2003 but that he greeted her with his pants down and performed a sex act on her.
Carter appeared in the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning,” recounting her accusations in emotional and vivid terms.
Carter said in the series that she reported the attack to police and ultimately appeared before a Cook County grand jury. She said grand jurors disbelieved her story and that charges were rejected. Carter came forward again after Foxx made an unusual public plea in early 2019 for Kelly’s accusers to reach out and cooperate with investigators.
In the case centered on H.W., prosecutors allege Kelly’s manager approached the girl as she celebrated her 16th birthday at a restaurant, gave her Kelly’s card and told her to contact him. After that they had repeated sexual contact, beginning in June 1998.

H.W. has also filed a civil suit alleging that she was “star struck” when Kelly’s associate told her to contact the singer. She thought she would get a role in a music video, the suit said. Instead, the two had regular sexual contact during which Kelly “represented to (H.W.) that this behavior was appropriate,” the suit said.
It was only years later that H.W., then an adult, realized from therapy that her “great shame, guilt, self-blame, confusion, depression” and other emotional distress had resulted from Kelly’s sexual abuse, the suit said.
The lawsuit filed by H.W. took a twist in early 2020, when neither Kelly nor his attorneys showed up for a court date, apparently due to a miscommunication or mix-up. As a result, a Cook County judge determined that H.W. should win her suit by default and ordered Kelly to pay her $4 million, a judgment he is appealing.

R. Kelly Reportedly Injured in Jail Amid Being Found Guilty of Child Pornography,"Robert Sylvester Kelly, aka R. Kelly, will be spending much more than 30 years in prison. After being sentenced in his Brooklyn racketeering case earlier this year, the disgraced R&B singer was found guilty of six charges in Illinois related to child pornography. He is scheduled to face sentencing in late September but is asking for special accommodations after suffering an alleged injury while behind bars. Kelly now faces a life sentence.

R. Kelly found guilty of child pornography
Unlike in his first child pornography case in his hometown stemming from a sex tape seen around the world with an underage girl in 2008, Kelly was not acquitted. The same tape was used as evidence in the new case. The game changer was the alleged victim in the video, who is now in her 30s, taking the stand to testify against the singer. In the first trial, her family claimed they fled town after being threatened by Kelly and opted not to be a witness for the prosecution.
Source: YouTube
The jury in the new case deliberated for 10 hours, finding Kelly guilty of three counts of producing child sex abuse images and an additional three counts of enticing underage girls to engage in criminal sexual activity. He was acquitted of seven other charges. His lawyer says he’s no saint but was not guilty of the crimes accused of.
The victim in the tape said on the stand that she vowed to take her experiences with Kelly to the grave. She testified that Kelly coerced her into having sex with him and other women hundreds of times, beginning when she was just 15. The singer reportedly paid the family off in addition to making threats amid the first trial.
Singer reports injury while behind bars
As he awaits sentencing, Kelly is asking the judge to make special exceptions for him. His lawyer alleges that his injury makes it hard for him to move around. The singer is set to appear in New York on Sept. 28th, but wants to appear via zoom.
Source: YouTube
In a letter to the judge obtained by The Jasmine Brand, his lawyer writes: “Undersigned counsel writes to respectfully request that Defendant Kelly be permitted to appear via zoom for the September 28th, 2022, restitution hearing. ​​Mr. Kelly is currently housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago, Illinois. Mr. Kelly has sustained an injury to his leg that makes traveling challenging and uncomfortable.”
How he obtained the injury is not known. But a judge has yet to rule.
The singer also has minimal funds in his jail account
As if being behind bars is reportedly difficult for Kelly to wrap his mind around, being broke adds to the turmoil. It’s been widely reported that a judge also ordered him to relinquish the $28,000 he collected in inmate commissary to be used to cover $140,000 court fines, which will be paid as restitution for his victims.
His lawyer does not agree with the ruling. “After seizing his funds and after sending this email, @EDNYnews decided to file a motion to confiscate his trust account money. You’re supposed to do that BEFORE you take the money,” she Tweeted.

It took more than two decades for “Jane” to come forward about the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her godfather, R&B superstar R. Kelly.
And in the end, a federal jury in Chicago believed her.

They believed her testimony that she was the one on the graphic videos directed by the Grammy-winning singer, a man twice her age. They believed their ears when they heard Jane’s high-pitched, heartbreakingly young voice refer to her “14-year-old” genitalia.
And they believed their own eyes in finally determining, in a court of law, that Kelly was guilty.

In a split verdict after a hotly contested trial, a federal jury convicted Kelly on child pornography charges for making three videotapes of himself sexually abusing Jane beginning in the late 1990s. The charges Kelly was convicted of carry a minimum of 10 years in prison.
The conviction on those counts comes 14 years after Kelly’s infamous acquittal on similar charges in Cook County, which were based on a single video of Kelly allegedly abusing Jane in the hot tub room of his former home on West George Street. Jane had refused to cooperate in that case.
Kelly was also found guilty Wednesday on three out of five counts related to enticement of a minor involving Jane, as she was known in the trial, and two other victims who came forward to testify against him.

But in a rare loss for federal prosecutors, the jury acquitted Kelly and two co-defendants on sensational charges they conspired to retrieve incriminating tapes and rig his 2008 trial by pressuring Jane to lie to investigators about their relationship and refuse to testify against him.
The jury of seven women and five men also acquitted Kelly and his two former associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, of conspiring to receive the footage that was shown in court. Jurors apparently determined that while the videos they saw were authentic, they could not say beyond a reasonable doubt that Kelly’s team schemed to get them back or even knowingly obtained them.
Kelly was also found not guilty of filming himself with Jane on a video that jurors never saw. Prosecutors said “Video 4″ was not played because Kelly’s team successfully buried it, but defense attorneys questioned whether it existed at all.
The long-awaited verdict came after five weeks of trial featuring some 34 witnesses. The jury deliberated for about 11 hours over two days before the decision was announced in the large ceremonial courtroom at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse.
Dressed in a blue suit and tie and black glasses, Kelly, 55, stared straight ahead and had no noticeable reaction to the jury’s decision. His attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, pumped a fist and rubbed Kelly’s back as some of the “not guilty” verdicts were read.

Kelly and McDavid, 61, were acquitted on charges they conspired to obstruct justice in Kelly’s 2002 Cook County case. The two men also were acquitted on charges they received child pornography.

As he was found not guilty on the last of the counts against him, McDavid shot up from his seat in the middle of the courtroom and thrust both fists toward the ceiling. Later, he bear-hugged Kelly from across the defense table and appeared to whisper something in his ear.
After court, McDavid’s attorneys asked U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber if their client could get his ankle monitor removed, given his complete exoneration. The judge said he wasn’t even sure of the procedure.
“This doesn’t happen often,” Leinenweber said. “But it should be done immediately.”
As attorneys packed up their things, McDavid said, “I’m buying the drinks tonight!”

Kelly, who has been in custody since his July 2019 arrest in Chicago, was led away to the lockup by deputy U.S. marshals. A sentencing date was not immediately set.
U.S. Attorney John Lausch told reporters Wednesday that Kelly could face anywhere from 10 to 90 years behind bars, and that prosecutors will request that his sentence be served consecutive to the 30 years he’s already received for racketeering conspiracy in a New York federal case.
“When we have instances where defendants are convicted of committing horrific acts against other individuals, and it’s separate and apart from other horrific acts that he committed against other individuals, we’re asking for that (sentence) to be consecutive,” Lausch said.
In the lobby of the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse after court, Bonjean told reporters she was glad to see the jury was able to make decisions on each count individually.
“They did their job. They looked at each count separately, and they obviously concluded, as I concluded long ago, this case was overcharged,” she said.
Bonjean said Kelly “is used to bad news,” but knows he’s got “more fights to fight,” including an appeal of his New York conviction and sentence and possibly an appeal in Chicago as well.

“What he did say is that he had a sense of relief that this particular case was not in the future, it was in the past now,” Bonjean said.
Bonjean also said she believed McDavid and Brown were charged only to try to get them to cooperate with investigators.

“Absolutely. That’s how the government rolls,” Bonjean said. “They don’t even believe in their own evidence, so they need to put pressure on other people to try to get them to flip. That’s exactly what happened. And I’m glad they got it. You know, but that didn’t work out for them.”
Bonjean also said prosecutors got “greedy” by proceeding with charges Kelly abused one victim, Brittany, even though she didn’t come in to testify.
Lausch disputed that, however, telling reporters it was “absolutely a righteous charge to bring” given the abuse Brittany allegedly suffered, and that his office would “bring it again tomorrow.” Lausch declined to say why Brittany didn’t testify.
Moments before Lausch spoke, McDavid stood beaming next to his lawyers, Beau Brindley, Vadim Glozman and Michael Thompson. Brindley said the verdict showed that the case against his client never should have been brought in the first place.

“We are grateful for these jurors to be able to see that when a lie is told on the witness stand, it will not be acceptable,” Brindley said. “Witnesses chose to lie, implicate this man and drag him through this experience from 2019 until today. Now, it’s over.”
Brown left the courthouse without comment.
The verdict marked a dramatic conclusion to a case that broke on July 11, 2019, when Kelly was arrested while walking his dog on the federal indictments brought simultaneously in Chicago and New York. The case endured many delays as it wound its way toward trial, including the COVID-19 pandemic that pushed the trial date back several times.
During the five-week trial, the jury was shown clips from three separate videos allegedly depicting Kelly abusing Jane, including the same tape from his Cook County trial as well as another where he instructed her to refer repeatedly to her “14-year-old” genitalia.
Last month, Jane testified for the first time that not only was it her on the videotapes, but that Kelly had sexually abused her “innumerable” times when she was a minor, at his recording studio, his home, on tour buses and in hotel rooms.
Asked on the witness stand why, after two decades of silence, she finally decided to come forward and speak out, Jane said: “I became exhausted with living with (Kelly’s) lies.”

In her closing argument Tuesday, Bonjean talked at length about Kelly’s relationship with Jane and her family, which continued far beyond her alleged abuse as a minor and, according to Bonjean, was approved by her parents.
“It is an inconvenient reality for the government,” Bonjean said. “Lives are complex, and for all the fist pounding and the outrage, that family made a decision that they had to live with at that time.”
Jane’s parents lied to the grand jury about her sexual relationship with the singer because “they didn’t care,” Bonjean said. “She was 17 and they didn’t care ... They condoned it.”
Bonjean noted that when the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” was coming out, Jane repeatedly reached out to Kelly but he never tried to influence her in any way. “He changed his phone number,” she said. “He goes silent on her. This is the most disinterested person in obstructing that I have ever seen.”
In rebuttal, however, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannice Appenteng said the evidence was clear that Kelly was a serial sexual predator and that his co-defendants made the decision to help him hide it to keep his career intact and keep lining their own pockets.
“What R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” Appenteng said. “And what the people around him wanted ... they wanted to help their boss, including helping him get away with it.”

Appenteng also urged the jury to pay special attention to Jane’s testimony and the videotapes of her abuse.
“You saw how (Kelly) was using her body, flipping her over, throwing her around like she was some rag doll,” Appenteng says. “That’s what this case is about.”
In addition to Jane, three other women told the jury that he sexually abused them when they were minors and he was a rising superstar. Kelly was convicted on charges related to three of them: Jane, “Nia” and “Pauline.”
All of the women faced hours of often-combative cross-examination from Bonjean, who hit hard on both their motives, the length of time it took them to come forward, and even whether they were truly underage when they began sexual relationships with the singer.
“Pauline” testified she was Jane’s best friend when they were teenagers and often hung out with her at Kelly’s home and Near West Side recording studio, Chicago Trax.
Now 37, Pauline said that when she and Jane were both about 14 years old she went looking for Jane at Kelly’s home and found her naked, kneeling in front of Kelly.

“He told me he was just looking for bruises on her, because she hurt herself,” she said. “I told him that ‘that’s not how you look for bruises’ and he said that’s how he looked for bruises … then he stated that ‘we all have secrets.’”
Kelly directed her to have sexual contact with him and Jane, and the three began to have sexual interactions regularly, she said. It was dozens or maybe hundreds of times when Pauline was ages 14 to 16, she testified. The legal age of consent in Illinois is 17.
“Tracy” told jurors she met Kelly in 1999, when she was a 16-year-old intern at a record label and he was 32. Not long afterward, Kelly gave her his phone number at an expo and told her to call him. When she did, he invited her to his studio, where he got her into an office area alone, she said.
He said he liked her, and she told him she was 16, she testified. “He’s like, ‘OK,’” she said. “He told me he was 23.” They kissed, and when she declined to give him oral sex, he performed a sex act on her, she said. “I tried to pull back, but he had a hold on my shirt and he was pleasuring himself,” she testified.
About a week later, Kelly sexually assaulted her in a hotel room, she testified, describing their encounter in explicit detail. “I told him I didn’t want to have sex, but he had forced himself in me,” she said. “When I asked him (to stop) he did stop.”
Tracy said their relationship turned to intercourse that summer, and that over the next year or so, they had sex about 50 times including some encounters involving other girls — including Jane. She said the relationship ended in 2001 when she was 18.

A fourth alleged victim, Nia, testified Kelly flew her to Minneapolis for one of his concerts after she met him in the spring of 1996 at an autograph signing at an Atlanta shopping mall, when she was 15.
Later that summer, Nia came to Chicago to stay with cousins and visited Kelly at his studio, she said. Over the course of the night he summoned her away twice so they could kiss alone in the hallway. During one of those instances he groped her under her pants, she testified.
In 2002, Nia filed a lawsuit against Kelly with the allegations of underage sexual contact, and Kelly agreed to pay $500,000 to settle the claim, she testified.
The fifth alleged victim Kelly was charged with abusing — Brittany — was the only one who did not take the witness stand, even though prosecutors had promised the jury in opening statements that they would hear from her.

Instead, jurors heard testimony from Jane and Pauline that Brittany was a friend of theirs and that Kelly had included her in various sexual encounters at his studio and Lakeview home, some of which were filmed.
“Brittany! Who is Brittany? Where is Brittany?” Bonjean shouted during her closing argument. “We don’t know anything about her. … That’s greed. That’s greediness on (prosecutors’) part, and it is not proper.”
Kelly was also acquitted of a count alleging he videotaped himself having sexual contact with Jane and prosecution witness Lisa Van Allen. While Van Allen and Jane testified that the threesome occurred and was videotaped, jurors did not view footage from that encounter.

Freeman told jurors a wildly memorable tale about how R. Kelly and his associates agreed to pay him up to a million dollars to hunt down videos.
The plot as described by Freeman spanned almost a decade, and unfolded in cities from Chicago to Kansas City and Atlanta, at Kelly’s music studio, concert venues and even the singer’s sprawling Olympia Fields mansion, where Freeman said he was told to strip naked and get in a pool to prove he wasn’t wearing a wire.
Defense attorneys noted that Freeman had told different versions of his story to different authorities over the years. In closing arguments, Brindley said Freeman’s testimony about busting into a Georgia home “like Shaft” to recover a sex tape was “just plain stupid.”

R. Kelly fue declarado culpable por producir pornografía infantil tras condena por abuso sexual,"El 29 de junio, R. Kelly recibió una sentencia de 30 años por los delitos de abuso y tráfico sexual de mujeres y niñas. Fueron varios testimonios presentados en la Corte que llevaron a la jueza Ann Donnely a tomar esta decisión, a pesar de que la defensa del cantante solicitó la absolución y hasta la repetición del juicio.
Ahora, al rapero nacido en Estados Unidos volvió a escuchar un fallo judicial en su contra luego de que el último miércoles 14 de septiembre se le declarara culpable por seis cargos: tres por producir pornografía infantil y otros tres por captar a menores de edad para forzarlos a mantener relaciones sexuales.
R. Kelly fue declarado culpable por producir pornografía infantil
Fueron 11 horas en los que los 12 jurados encargados de emitir su veredicto deliberaron, no sin antes evaluar los videos presentados por la parte acusatoria, en los que R. Kelly aparece cometiendo actos sexuales en contra de menores de edad durante los años 90.
R. Kelly se encuentra recluido en una correccional de Chicago desde junio de 2019.
Incluso se llegó a conocer que estas cintas eran distribuidas por el propio artista por distintas partes de la ciudad de Detroit. Poco después y cuando empezaron las denuncias en su contra, el dos veces ganador del Grammy comenzó a tratar de recuperar este material por el que llegó a ofrecer un millón de dólares y que luego serían la prueba clave para su hundimiento.
¿Cuántos años podría recibir R. Kelly tras esta nueva condena?
De momento, R. Kelly viene purgando una sentencia de 30 años en una prisión de Nueva York y deberá esperar a la confirmación del nuevo castigo. No obstante, los tres cargos por los que se le declaró culpable son castigados hasta con 10 años en dicho estado.
De esta manera, Robert Sylvester Kelly podría pasar hasta 60 años recluido de su libertad, siendo este uno de los casos más mediáticos en Estados Unidos, el cual fue tomado por el movimiento Me Too como una victoria.",2022-09-15T23:44:48Z,https://larepublica.pe,LaRepública.pe
EXPLAINER: R. Kelly acquitted on rigging trial. Why?,"This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate
CHICAGO (AP) — Federal prosecutors this week scored multiple convictions against R. Kelly at the singer’s trial in Chicago, but they lost on the headline charge — that Kelly obstructed justice by rigging his 2008 state child pornography trial, at which jurors acquitted him.
Kelly co-defendant and longtime business manager Derrel McDavid was also acquitted on the same count, as well as three other charges.
After the verdict, U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed disappointment in not winning convictions across the board. But he said Kelly was still looking at a prison sentence of 10 to 90 years. He said he was pleased Kelly was “finally being held accountable.”
Sentencing is set for Feb. 23. Kelly, 55, is already serving a 30-year prison term imposed by a federal judge in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking.
At least one legal expert said obstruction of justice charges aren’t generally hard to prove. “But in this case,"" said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, ""the facts just weren’t there.”
Jurors also acquitted Kelly of receiving child pornography and one count of producing child pornography. He was convicted of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex. His attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, plans to appeal.
Here’s a look at the trial-fixing charge:
WHAT DID PROSECUTORS ALLEGE?
The claim was that Kelly and McDavid conspired to ensure key witnesses at the 2008 trial would lie about Kelly’s sexual abuse of girls and refuse to testify.
Prosecutors also alleged Kelly and McDavid concealed critical evidence. Witnesses at the just-ended trial described their frantic scramble to recover lost Kelly videos of himself sexually abusing girls.
They offered six — and in at least one case seven — figure payoffs in cash for the return of videos, which prosecutors said they knew would lead to a conviction in 2008.
The conspirators, said prosecutors, applied particular pressure on a girl — now 37 and referred to in federal court as “Jane” — and her parents. State and federal prosecutors said she was the girl Kelly is seen sexually abusing on a VHS tape that was at the heart of the 2008 trial.
DID THE PRESSURE WORK?
Prosecutors said it did.
Jane and her parents said they lied to a grand jury in the early 2000s about Kelly’s sexual abuse, and they didn't testify at the 2008 trial. Jurors at that trial said they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because the victim did not testify.
“That jury was scammed. They were scammed by Robert Kelly and his fixers,"" prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors this week, using Kelly's given first name.
Federal prosecutors said the payoffs that started in the early 2000s included funding trips by Jane and her parents to the Bahamas and Cancun, Mexico.
Critically to their theory of the case, federal prosecutors also alleged Kelly intermittently paid Jane’s rent — by then in her 30s — until just several years ago to ensure she kept quiet.
WHAT WERE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FOR PROSECUTORS?
Steps Kelly and others allegedly took to fix the 2008 trial happened two decades ago, so memories of how the purported crime unfolded have dimmed. At least four men who may have had direct knowledge of what happened have since died.
Among them was Jane’s father, who died a year ago.
For the child pornography count, the evidence included video that jurors saw. On enticement, they heard directly from Kelly accusers — Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. One of the enticement counts they didn’t convict him on was related to an accuser who did not testify.
WHAT WITNESSES DID PROSECUTORS CALL?
Their star witness was Jane.
On the stand, she said publicly for the first time that she was the girl in the video at the center of both the federal trial and the trial 14 years ago. She said she was 14 in the video and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
She testified she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said that it was not her. She said she wanted to protect Kelly, and added: “I also did not want that person to be me. … I was ashamed.”
Jane’s mother, who went by “Susan,” also testified. She said she lied to the state grand jury, in part because she and her husband felt threatened by Kelly and feared for their lives.
Susan said she, her husband and Kelly cried as the parents confronted Kelly about sexually abusing their daughter. While asking for forgiveness, she said Kelly also said: “You are either with us or against us.”
She took Kelly's words as a threat. “We were very, very frightened,” she said.
Another key witness was Kelly's ex-girlfriend Lisa Van Allen. She told jurors she stole a sex video around 2000 from a gym bag Kelly had that was full of such recordings on a rare occasion when he left it unattended.
Van Allen said McDavid told her in 2007 that she should have been killed for all the trouble she caused Kelly.
WHAT DID DEFENSE LAWYERS TELL JURORS?
They repeatedly attacked the credibility of the government's main witnesses, noting that most testified with immunity, including Jane, her mom and Van Allen.
“They came in here to tell the government’s version of the truth,” Bonjean, Kelly’s lawyer, said.
WHAT MIGHT HAVE JURORS HAD DOUBTS ABOUT?
Kelly’s payments for Jane’s rent, what they were for and how long they lasted was critical to deciding guilt on the trial-fixing charge.
That’s because the federal statute of limitation says someone can’t be charged with such a conspiracy if it ceased within five years of an indictment.
Kelly and McDavid were indicted on that and other charges in 2019. So prosecutors had to show the conspiracy ran up to at least 2014. The rent payments to Jane after 2014, they say, was part of the continuous conspiracy.
Attorneys for Kelly and McDavid balked at the claim that the rent payments were hush money. They noted that Kelly remained friendly with Jane and her parents for many years after the 2008 trial. Jane testified, too, that she cared deeply for Kelly at least until his 2019 indictment.
Defense lawyers argued that, even if there ever was a conspiracy, it didn’t last beyond 2014.
WHAT WERE SOME OF OTHER ARGUMENTS?
Defense attorneys said several core government interpretations of things Kelly said were a stretch.
For example, they said Kelly's remark to Jane's parents that “you are either with us or against us” could have meant any number of things — not only that Kelly would hurt them financially or otherwise.
Bonjean also questioned why Susan continued to mix with Kelly socially for the next 20 years, if she felt so threatened.
McDavid’s lawyer, Beau Brindley, also mocked Van Allen's claim that McDavid threatened to kill her, sarcastically referring to his client as a “murderous accountant.”

Kelly and McDavid were indicted on that and other charges in 2019. So, prosecutors had to show the conspiracy ran up to at least 2014. The rent payments to Jane after 2014, they say, was part of the continuous conspiracy.
Attorneys for Kelly and McDavid balked at the claim that the rent payments were hush money. They noted that Kelly remained friendly with Jane and her parents for many years after the 2008 trial. Jane testified, too, that and she said still cared deeply for Kelly at least until his 2019 indictment.
Defense lawyers argued that, even if there ever was a conspiracy, it didn’t last beyond 2014.
WHAT WERE SOME OF OTHER ARGUMENTS?
Defense attorneys said several core government interpretations of things Kelly said were a stretch.
For example, the said Kelly's remark to Jane's parents that “you are either with us or against us” could have meant any number of things — not only that Kelly would hurt them financially or otherwise.
Bonjean also questioned why Susan continued to mix with Kelly socially for the next 20 years, if she felt so threatened.
McDavid’s lawyer, Beau Brindley also mocked Van Allen's claim that McDavid threatened to kill her, sarcastically referring to his client as a “murderous accountant.”

"R. Kelly Attorney Requests Virtual Hearing, Says Singer Is Injured: Report","On the heels of the news regarding the verdict in R. Kelly's Chicago trial, it has been reported that the singer has suffered an injury. The disgraced hitmaker faced 13 charges and was convicted of six, including child pornography and enticing a minor. This follows his New York conviction and as his supporters continue to defend him against the allegations of sex crimes, many believe it is unlikely that Kelly will see freedom.
In a new report by AllHipHop, Kelly and his legal team are preparing for the victim's restitution hearing in New York. However, the outlet claims they've obtained documents that state the singer's attorneys are asking if Kelly will be able to attend virtually.

It seems that the music icon reportedly has a leg injury that is keeping him from being able to travel from his hometown.
“Undersigned counsel writes to respectfully request that Defendant Kelly be permitted to appear via zoom for the September 28th, 2022, restitution hearing,” Kelly's attorney reportedly stated. “Mr. Kelly is currently housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago, Illinois. Mr. Kelly has sustained an injury to his leg that makes traveling challenging and uncomfortable.”
“Furthermore, a significant amount of resources would have to be utilized to have Mr. Kelly flown in from Chicago to the Eastern District of New York for this hearing. For the foregoing reasons, Defendant respectfully requests that he be permitted to appear via zoom for the hearing. The government has no objection to this request.”
In his New York case, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison and now, those who have been following these cases will soon learn the singer's fate in Chicago. He has long denied the allegations against him and the ongoing scandal often causes a divide among music lovers as they debate separating the man from his crimes.

快訊／天王歌手勞凱利「製作兒童色情片」慘了！ 恐面臨90年刑期,"▲勞凱利曾奪下3座葛萊美獎。（圖／路透社）
記者曾羿翔／綜合報導
美國知名歌手勞凱利（R. Kelly）15日被判定犯下「製作兒童色情影片」等6項罪名，未來恐將面臨10到90年的刑期。現年55歲的勞凱利在今年6月才因多項性侵罪名，被紐約東區聯邦地區法院判處30年徒刑。
綜合外媒報導，勞凱利被譽為美國節奏藍調R&B天王，曾奪下3座葛萊美獎。芝加哥聯邦法院12人陪審團則在15日做出判決，認定勞凱利犯下「3項製作兒童色情影片罪」以及「3項引誘兒童罪」，共6項罪名。
報導指出，陪審團做出裁決前經過了11個小時的審議，在開庭時，陪審團還檢視了勞凱利性侵害年僅14歲少女的影片，而該段影片也是此次判決的關鍵。裁決結果宣布時，勞凱利還對在場旁聽者立刻豎起大拇指。此外，勞凱利在伊利諾伊州仍面臨其他性虐待指控。
勞凱利曾因《I Believe I Can Fly》一曲走紅全世界，更替流行天王麥可傑克森（Michael Jackson）寫《You're Not Alone（你不孤單）》獲得金氏世界紀錄認證「第一個憑單曲空降美國告示牌單曲榜冠軍」，但2002年曾被指控性侵未成年者，2008年被判無罪。

Cantor R. Kelly é condenado por pornografia infantil e abuso de menores,"O artista de R&B R. Kelly, de 55 anos, que já havia sido condenado a 30 anos de prisão por crimes sexuais, foi novamente condenado, agora por uma corte federal dos Estados Unidos, por pornografia infantil e abuso sexual de menores de idade. A pena ainda não foi estabelecida, mas segundo o TMZ, poderá chegar a 90 anos.
Um vídeo dele urinando em cima de uma jovem de 14 anos foi mostrado no tribunal e serviu como prova. A vítima testemunhou contra ele. Outros dois vídeos dele abusando de mulheres foram revelados na corte, e o júri determinou que o cantor americano deveria ser considerado culpado. A advogada dele, Jennifer Bonjean , disse ao júri que ele era ""imperfeito"", mas inocente.
O julgamento do músico já contou com depoimentos impressionantes como o de uma ex-afilhada que afirmou ter mantido relações sexuais ""centenas de vezes"" com o cantor antes de completar 18 anos. Atualmente, ela tem 37 anos e usa o pseudônimo Jane. A mulher disse que não conseguia dizer não por se sentir intimidada demais na ocasião.
Em setembro de 2021, Kelly foi condenado por tráfico sexual, em um júri que aconteceu no tribunal federal do Brooklyn durante cinco semanas e meia. Os jurados deliberaram por pouco mais de um dia antes de votarem pela condenação em todas as acusações. (Folhapress)",2022-09-15T16:12:59Z,https://www.otempo.com.br,O Tempo
R. Kelly a été reconnu coupable de production de pornographie juvénile à Chicago,"Un jury fédéral a reconnu le chanteur R. Kelly coupable de plusieurs chefs d’accusation liés à la production de pornographie juvénile, mercredi, ce qui représente un nouveau revers juridique pour celui qui a déjà été l’une des plus grandes vedettes du R&B au monde.
R. Kelly, âgé de 55 ans, a été reconnu coupable sur trois chefs liés à la pornographie juvénile et sur trois chefs pour avoir incité des filles mineures à avoir des relations sexuelles. Il a toutefois été acquitté en ce qui a trait aux accusations selon lesquelles il aurait truqué son procès d’État en 2008, ainsi que sur un quatrième chef lié à la pornographie juvénile. Ses deux coaccusés ont été reconnus non coupables. Cette décision survient quelques mois après que le chanteur a reçu une sentence de prison de 30 ans par un juge fédéral à New York en lien avec des accusations de trafic sexuel. En vertu de ce premier verdict, il ne sera pas libéré avant d’atteindre l’âge de 80 ans, environ.
Le procès tenu à Chicago ces dernières semaines était en quelque sorte une reprise du procès de 2008. Dans les deux cas, la même vidéo était l’élément central de l’accusation. À Chicago, une condamnation pour un seul chef d’accusation de production de pornographie juvénile entraîne une peine minimale obligatoire de 10 ans de prison, tandis que la réception de pornographie juvénile entraîne une peine minimale de cinq ans. Les juges peuvent ordonner que les délinquants condamnés antérieurement dans des affaires distinctes purgent leur nouvelle peine en même temps que la première ou seulement après que celle-ci soit terminée. Les détenus fédéraux doivent purger au moins 85 % de leur peine.
Les procédures devant les tribunaux pour R. Kelly _ qui vivait dans un quartier pauvre de Chicago avant de s’élever au rang de vedette mondiale récompensée par un Grammy _ ne sont pas terminées pour autant. Deux autres procès sont toujours en cours: l’un au Minnesota et l’autre dans un tribunal d’État de Chicago. R. Kelly, qui est connu pour sa célèbre chanson « I Believe I Can Fly » et pour ses morceaux à connotation sexuelle comme « Bump n’ Grind », a vendu des millions d’albums, même après que des allégations d’agressions sexuelles ont commencé à circuler dans les années 1990.
Les allégations le concernant ont toutefois pris beaucoup plus d’ampleur lors du mouvement #MoiAussi et avec la sortie d’une série documentaire intitulée « Survivre à R. Kelly », en 2019. Les jurés avaient commencé à délibérer mardi après que le juge Harry Leinenweber leur a donné ses instructions. Ils ont finalement débattu pendant 11 heures, réparties sur deux jours, avant d’en arriver à un verdict.

R Kelly a été reconnu coupable dans son procès fédéral pour pornographie infantile,"Le chanteur des années 90, 55 ans, a été reconnue coupable mercredi de six des 13 chefs d'accusation à l'issue d'un procès d'un mois dans sa ville natale de Chicago, sa ville natale. Cette condamnation intervient après que Kelly - de son vrai nom Robert Sylvester Kelly - ait été condamné à 30 ans de prison en juin dernier après avoir été reconnu coupable de trafic sexuel et de racket dans une autre affaire fédérale à Brooklyn.
Les jurés l'ont reconnu coupable dans le procès de Chicago après 11 heures de délibération qui a commencé mardi après-midi. (13.09.22)
Kelly était accusé de s'être filmé en train d'avoir des relations sexuelles avec des filles mineures, ainsi que d'avoir truqué son procès de 2008 pour pornographie infantile.
Son co-accusé Derrell McDavid - l'ancien directeur commercial de Kelly - a été accusé d'avoir conspiré pour faire obstruction à la justice en truquant le procès de 2008, ainsi que de deux chefs d'accusation pour avoir reçu de la pornographie infantile.
Un autre co-accusé, Milton Brown, associé de Kelly, a été accusé de conspiration pour avoir réceptionne de la pornographie enfantine.
Selon CBS Chicago, tous deux ont été déclarés non coupables de tous les chefs d'accusation.
L'assistante du procureur Elizabeth Pozolo a déclaré aux jurés : ""Robert Kelly a abusé de nombreuses filles pendant de nombreuses années.
""Il a commis des crimes horribles contre des enfants... toutes ces années plus tard, la face cachée de Robert Kelly a été révélée.""
Les preuves accablantes contre Kelly comprenaient des vidéos graphiques du lauréat de Grammy abusant de sa filleule alors âgée de 14 ans, qui est devenue le témoin vedette de l'accusation dans cette affaire lorsqu'elle a témoigné sous le nom de Jane.
Pozolo a dit dans sa plaidoirie finale avant que le jury se retire pour délibérations : ""Cette enfant, qui n'avait jamais eu d'expériences sexuelles dans sa vie, a été forcée de s'allonger sur ce sol pendant que cet homme assis juste là, lui urinait dessus.
""Cet acte dégradant est immortalisé à jamais sur cette vidéo. Cet abus est mémorisé à jamais.""
Aujourd'hui âgée de 37 ans, Jane a déclaré que Kelly avait eu des relations sexuelles avec elle ""d'innombrables fois"", y compris avec d'autres adolescentes qu'il lui avait demandé de recruter dans leur relation.
Les avocats de Kelly ont qualifié les témoins de l'accusation de ""parjures, maîtres chanteurs et extorqueurs"". La nouvelle condamnation pourrait ajouter des années à la peine de 30 ans infligée à Kelly. Deux autres procès sont également en cours contre le chanteur - l'un dans le Minnesota et l'autre dans un tribunal d'État à Chicago.",2022-09-15T12:00:00Z,https://www.lfm.ch,lfm.ch
Urteil in Chicago: R. Kelly erneut schuldig gesprochen,"Jahrzehntelang erschien es so, als sei der Musiker unangreifbar, dann wurde R. Kelly vor einigen Wochen zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt. Nun hat ihn eine Jury in Chicago abermals schuldig gesprochen, in sechs von 13 Punkten.
R. Kelly ist erneut wegen Sexualstraftaten verurteilt worden. Eine Jury in Chicago befand den 55-Jährigen am Mittwoch schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben, wie US-Medien übereinstimmend berichteten. Erst vor einigen Wochen war der ""I Believe I Can Fly""-Sänger in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen des Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt worden.
In einem zweiten Prozess in Chicago war er in 13 Punkten angeklagt gewesen, unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen und der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen. Laut New York Times sprachen die zwölf Geschworenen ihn in sieben Punkten frei - unter anderem vom Vorwurf der Behinderung der Justiz. Das Strafmaß wird zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt verkündet, Kelly droht erneut eine jahrzehntelange Haftstrafe.
Der Musiker hatte die Vorwürfe stets zurückgewiesen. Er sitzt seit Sommer 2019 im Gefängnis. Zwei weitere angeklagte Ex-Angestellte Kellys wurden freigesprochen. In Chicago ging es auch um ein bereits viele Jahre bekanntes Video, das Kelly zeigen soll, wie er ein 14-jähriges Mädchen missbraucht und auf sie uriniert. In diesem Fall war der Musiker 2008 von einer Jury bereits freigesprochen worden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft hatte ihm vorgeworfen, das Opfer unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit es nicht in dem Prozess aussagt. In dem neuen Prozess hatte die mittlerweile volljährige Frau aber bestätigt, dass sie die Person in dem Video ist.
Erste Anschuldigungen schon vor 25 Jahren
Das Verfahren ist - nach Fällen wie denen von Filmproduzent Harvey Weinstein und Komiker Bill Cosby - eine weitere viel beachtete juristische Aufarbeitung in der ""Me Too""-Ära. Erste Anschuldigungen gegen den 1967 in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborenen Musiker wurden bereits vor rund 25 Jahren bekannt. Doch der Musiker schien unangreifbar zu sein auf seinem Pop-Thron und blieb lange Zeit auf freiem Fuß.
Mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben, mehreren Grammys und anderen Auszeichnungen gehörte er zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern des späten 20. Jahrhunderts. Aber spätestens als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation ""Surviving R. Kelly"" die Anschuldigungen zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer. Stars distanzierten sich von ihm, zudem Radiosender, Streaming-Dienste und dann auch sein Musiklabel RCA, das zu Sony Music gehört.",2022-09-15T11:05:23Z,https://www.sueddeutsche.de,Süddeutsche Zeitung
Cantor R. Kelly é declarado culpado de pornografia infantil,"O cantor foi condenado por três acusações de produção de pornografia infantil e outras três por atrair um menor para relações sexuais
O cantor de R&B R. Kelly, que cumpre pena de 30 anos por crimes sexuais, foi declarado culpado de pornografia infantil nesta quarta-feira, após um mês de julgamento em sua cidade natal, Chicago.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55, foi condenado por três acusações de produção de pornografia infantil e outras três por atrair um menor para relações sexuais, informou o “Chicago Tribune”.
Kelly, três vezes vencedor do Grammy, foi absolvido por um júri federal de outras sete acusações, incluindo a de obstrução da Justiça em um julgamento anterior, destacou o jornal. Ele e dois ex-sócios eram acusados de obstruir um julgamento de pornografia infantil em 2008, no qual um júri o considerou inocente.
O ex-representante de Kelly Derrel McDavid e um antigo funcionário, Milton “June” Brown, também foram absolvidos hoje das acusações de obstrução.
O júri, de 12 pessoas, levou cerca de 11 horas para chegar ao veredito, que poderia adicionar uma forte condenação à sentença de 30 anos de prisão que o cantor recebeu em Nova York em setembro por recrutar adolescentes e mulheres para praticar sexo. No caso de Nova York, o cantor de “I Believe I Can Fly” foi declarado culpado de oito acusações de tráfico sexual e uma de extorsão.
A condenação de R. Kelly naquela cidade, a primeira em um julgamento no qual a maioria das partes civis eram mulheres negras, foi considerada um ponto de virada no movimento #MeToo. Os debates lançaram luz sobre “o sistema” de R. Kelly para atrair jovens e estuprá-las com a cumplicidade de pessoas do seu entorno.
Muitas vítimas contaram que o conheceram em shows e que membros da equipe do artista lhes entregaram pedaços de papel com o contato do cantor, que também é processado em outros dois estados. Várias delas disseram que receberam a promessa de que Kelly poderia fazer decolar sua carreira musical.
CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE
O que realmente acontecia era que elas eram “doutrinadas” e forçadas a ter relações sexuais, mantidos em um “sistema sórdido, sob medidas coercitivas”, segundo a acusação.

R. Kelly de nouveau condamné : combien d'années va-t-il passer en prison ?,"R KELLY. Le chanteur R. Kelly, déjà condamné à 30 ans de prison pour une série de crimes sexuels, l'a été de nouveau pour pédopornographie et détournement de mineur.
[Mis à jour le 15 septembre 2022 à 11h44] La peine de prison de R. Kelly s'alourdit encore. Condamné en juin dernier à 30 ans de réclusion criminelle, le chanteur déchu l'a été de nouveau, mercredi 14 septembre, pour production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur, selon le site américain Chicago Tribune.
Le verdict ""oblige Robert Kelly à rendre des comptes pour les violences sexuelles commises sur une adolescente de 14 ans. Les souffrances infligées par M. Kelly à ses victimes sont immenses"", a déclaré John Lausch, procureur de Chicago, saluant ""la force, la détermination et le courage"" de celles qui ont témoigné lors du procès.
Les douze personnes composant le jury de ce procès, qui ont pu délibérer durant onze heures, ont assisté à la diffusion de vidéos montrant les violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur de jeunes adolescentes. En revanche, ce dernier a été acquitté par le jury fédéral pour d'autres chefs d'inculpation, comme obstruction à la justice.
R. Kelly écope à une nouvelle peine de prison pouvant aller de dix ans, la peine minimale, à 90 ans. Des années qui s'ajoutent aux 30 ans de réclusion criminelle prononcés en juin dernier.
R Kelly déjà condamné
30 ans de prison. Le tribunal fédéral de Brooklyn a condamné, mercredi 29 juin 2022, le chanteur R.Kelly. Une peine qui soldait un grand nombre de chefs d'accusation, notamment extorsion, exploitation sexuelle de mineur, enlèvement, trafic, corruption et travail forcé, sur une période allant de 1994 à 2018. R. Kelly, qui a fait appel, a toujours nié ces faits dont il avait été reconnu coupable en septembre dernier.
A l'époque, les procureurs fédéraux avaient requis 25 ans de réclusion criminelle, décrivant l'interprète de I Believe I Can Fly, comme un ""criminel, prédateur"" et un ""danger"" pour ses victimes. Il avait aussi été reconnu coupable, entre autres, d'avoir dirigé pendant près de 25 ans un ""système"" d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes femmes, dont des mineures.
R.Kelly, 30 ans d'accusations
Condamné à 30 ans de prison, R.Kelly défraie la chronique depuis près d'une trentaine d'année. Dès le début de sa carrière, il est accusé de pédophilie. Le premier scandale remonte à 1994, époque à laquelle il fréquence une jeune femme, Aaliyah, avec qui il se serait marié en falsifiant son âge, la faisant passer de 15 ans à 18 ans. A l'époque, R.Kelly lui, était âgé de 27 ans. Le mariage sera annulé deux mois plus tard et la jeune femme décèdera en 2001.
En 1998, R.Kelly aurait acheté le silence de Tiffany Hawkins, qui assure avoir eu des relations sexuelles avec le chanteur lorsqu'elle avait 15 ans, pour 250 000 dollars. Même processus en 2001 avec Tracy Sampson, une ancienne stagiaire avec qui il aurait eu des rapports sexuels lorsqu'elle avait 17 ans. A l'époque, toutes ces accusations se soldent par un acquittement ou un non lieu.
En 2019, le documentaire intitulé Surviving R.Kelly déclenche un séisme et les accusations de viol pleuvent. Pour R.Kelly, c'est le début de la chute. Le chanteur est inculpé dans plusieurs États américains pour différents chefs d'accusation, notamment à Chicago et dans les Etats de l'Illinois et de New York
R. Kelly jugé coupable
Après plus d'un mois de procès, le verdict est tombé : R. Kelly a été reconnu coupable de ""trafic sexuel"", lundi 27 septembre 2021 par le tribunal fédéral de Brooklyn, à New York. Pendant plus d'un mois, l'ancienne star du R'n'B, connue pour son tube I Believe I Can Fly, a été jugée pour une série de crimes sexuels, notamment pour extorsion, exploitation sexuelle de mineur, enlèvement, corruption et travail forcé, sur une période allant de 1994 à 2018.
Cette affaire et cette condamnation marquaient déjà un tournant fort dans le mouvement #metoo, la star déchue étant accusée majoritairement par des femmes, noires, venues décrire à la barre des viols, des prises de drogues forcées, des situations d'emprisonnement ou encore des faits de pédopornographie. R. Kelly, lui, a toujours plaidé non coupable.
Les témoignages contre R. Kelly
Au total, onze personnes ont témoigné contre l'artiste, neuf femmes et deux hommes. A la barre, une accusatrice du nom d'Angela a affirmé avoir été témoin d'agressions sexuelles du chanteur sur la chanteuse Aaliyah (décédée dans un crash d'avion en 2001), que l'artiste avait épousée illégalement alors qu'elle était âgée de 15 ans. Devant les juges, Angela a expliqué à la barre avoir surpris un rapport sexuel entre le chanteur et la jeune fille, âgée de 13 ou 14 ans à l'époque, rapporte le New York Times. Elle serait la plus jeune victime connue de R. Kelly.
Parmi les autres accusateurs de l'artiste, Jane Doe No 5 (selon le nom cité dans le rapport judiciaire), qui accuse R. Kelly de l'avoir abusé à plusieurs reprises durant cinq ans, alors qu'il était âgé de 17 ans. Ce témoin explique avoir contracté de l'herpès après ses rapports avec le chanteur, qui serait sous traitement pour cette maladie sexuellement transmissible depuis 2007. Une autre des neuf accusatrices de R. Kelly assure également avoir été contaminée.
Outre les accusations d'agressions sexuelles, les témoins ont évoqué à la barre les violences qu'ils auraient subies de la part de R. Kelly, notamment des ""punitions"" s'ils n'accédaient pas à ses désirs, ou affirment avoir été filmés contre leur gré lors d'actes sexuels, comme le détaille la BBC.
Qui est le chanteur R. Kelly ?
Robert Sylvester Kelly, alias R. Kelly, est né le 8 janvier 1967 à Chicago, dans l'Illinois, aux Etats-Unis. C'est au début des années 1990 qu'il fait ses débuts dans la musique, en participant au concours télévisé Big Break, qu'il remporte. Le jeune artiste sort un premier album, Born into the 90's, en 1992, puis 12 Play en 1993. R. Kelly se fait rapidement un nom dans le R'n'B aux Etats-Unis : en 1995, il est nommé deux fois aux Grammy Awards, pour l'écriture et la composition de la chanson de Michael Jackson, You Are Not Alone.
En 1995, sa carrière prend un tout autre tournant avec la parution de l'album R. Kelly, qui contient le tube de sa vie : I Believe I Can Fly, écrit à l'origine pour le film Space Jam. Nommée trois fois aux Grammy Awards, la chanson fait de l'artiste une star internationale. Passionné de basket, R. Kelly signe en 1997 avec les Atlantic City Seagulls de l'United States Basketball League (USBL). Il publie ensuite une douzaine d'albums, notamment R. en 1998, TP-2.com en 2000, Chocolate Factory en 2003, Double Up en 2007, Untitled en 2009, Love Letter en 2010 ou encore Write Me Back en 2012 et Black Panties en 2013. R. Kelly a travaillé avec les plus grands artistes du monde, de Michael Jackson à Lady Gaga en passant par Lil Wayne ou T.I. et T-Pain.
Une carrière prolifique entachée de scandales, dès les années 2000. En janvier 2019, le documentaire Surviving R. Kelly, diffusé sur la chaîne de télévision américaine Lifetime, le présente comme un prédateur sexuel, pédophile, à la tête d'un réseau d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes femmes et met fin à sa carrière musicale, en plein mouvement #metoo.
Qui sont les femmes de R. Kelly ?
Parallèlement à l'explosion de sa notoriété dans les années 1990, R. Kelly épouse en 1994 la chanteuse et actrice Aaliyah, âgée de 15 ans (lui en avait 27). Un mariage qui fait scandale et qui se termine par l'annulation par les parents de la mariée, qu'ils envoient en Europe. En 1996, R. Kelly se remarie avec la chorégraphe et danseuse Andrea Lee, avec qui il a trois enfants. Cette dernière fait partie des accusatrices du chanteur.",2022-09-15T09:45:00Z,https://www.linternaute.com,Linternaute.com

R. Kelly found guilty in federal child pornography case,"A Chicago federal jury found singer R. Kelly guilty of three counts of child pornography for filming himself sexually abusing his then-14-year-old goddaughter.According to the reports, of the indictment's 13 charges, Kelly was also found guilty of three counts of child sex trafficking through coercion and enticement, reports a news portal.He was acquitted on charges that he conspired to obstruct justice in his 2002 Cook County case. Additionally, he was acquitted on two counts of receiving child pornography and one count of conspiring to receive child pornography.The verdict delivered on Wednesday follows the testimony of Kelly's goddaughter, who went by the pseudonym Jane. Three other women testified that Kelly had also recorded and kept tapes of himself sexually abusing them when they were underage.There were two co-defendants in the proceedings, former employees Milton ""June"" Brown and Derrel McDavid.Charges against them alleged a conspiracy to hide the videotapes and convince Jane to keep her sexual contact with Kelly private. Both Brown and McDavid were acquitted of all charges, including that they had conspired to receive child pornography, and that McDavid conspired to obstruct justice.In closing arguments, Kelly's attorney Jennifer Bonjean claimed that Jane's parents were to blame for lying about her relationship with the singer and asserted this was not due to coercion, but because ""They condoned it.""Kelly was convicted on enticement counts regarding witnesses Jane, Nia and Pauline (all pseudonyms), but was found not guilty on two others.Jurors acquitted Kelly of the alleged enticement counts in relation to another woman Tracy, one of the only witnesses whose age at the time of her alleged meetings with Kelly was challenged by defence attorneys. Jurors also acquitted Kelly on one count of enticement related to Brittany, whom prosecutors had originally planned to take the stand. That did not happen for reasons that remain unclear.Jane joined the investigation just three years ago, after the airing of the 2019 Lifetime docuseries ""Surviving R. Kelly."" In her June verdict, Jane testified that it was her on the videotapes and that Kelly had sexually abused her multiple times as a minor.Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June after a jury declared him guilty of racketeering related to the sexual exploitation of children, kidnapping, and forced labour. He was also charged with eight counts of violating the Mann Act in a separate federal case in New York.",2022-09-15T08:50:00Z,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com,Times of India
R. Kelly erneut schuldig gesprochen,"Jahrzehntelang schien es so, als sei der Musiker unangreifbar, dann wurde R. Kelly vor einigen Wochen zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt. Nun hat ihn eine Jury in Chicago abermals schuldig gesprochen, in sechs von 13 Punkten.
R. Kelly ist erneut wegen Sexualstraftaten verurteilt worden. Eine Jury in Chicago befand den 55-Jährigen am Mittwoch schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben, wie US-Medien übereinstimmend berichteten. Erst vor einigen Wochen war der ""I believe I can fly""-Sänger in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen des Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt worden.
In einem zweiten Prozess in Chicago war er in 13 Punkten angeklagt gewesen, unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen und der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen. Laut New York Times sprachen die zwölf Geschworenen ihn in sieben Punkten frei - unter anderem vom Vorwurf der Behinderung der Justiz. Das Strafmaß wird zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt verkündet, Kelly droht erneut eine jahrzehntelange Haftstrafe.
Der Musiker hatte die Vorwürfe stets zurückgewiesen. Er sitzt seit Sommer 2019 im Gefängnis. Zwei weitere angeklagte Ex-Angestellte Kellys wurden freigesprochen. In Chicago ging es auch um ein bereits viele Jahre bekanntes Video, das Kelly zeigen soll, wie er ein 14-jähriges Mädchen missbraucht und auf sie uriniert. In diesem Fall war der Musiker 2008 von einer Jury bereits freigesprochen worden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft hatte ihm vorgeworfen, das Opfer unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit es nicht in dem Prozess aussagt. In dem neuen Prozess hatte die mittlerweile volljährige Frau aber bestätigt, dass sie die Person in dem Video ist.
Das Verfahren ist - nach Fällen wie denen von Filmproduzent Harvey Weinstein und Komiker Bill Cosby - eine weitere viel beachtete juristische Aufarbeitung in der MeToo-Ära. Erste Anschuldigungen gegen den 1967 in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborenen Musiker wurden bereits vor rund 25 Jahren bekannt. Doch der Musiker schien unangreifbar zu sein auf seinem Pop-Thron und blieb lange Zeit auf freiem Fuß.
Mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben, mehreren Grammys und anderen Auszeichnungen gehörte er zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern des späten 20. Jahrhunderts. Aber spätestens als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation ""Surviving R. Kelly"" die Anschuldigungen zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer. Stars distanzierten sich von ihm, zudem Radiosender, Streaming-Dienste und dann auch sein Musiklabel RCA, das zu Sony Music gehört.",2022-09-15T08:32:01Z,https://www.sueddeutsche.de,Süddeutsche Zeitung
"Más años de cárcel para R. Kelly, ahora condenado por pornografía infantil y abuso sexual de menores","La palabra 'monstruo' empieza a quedarse pequeña para describir a R. Kelly, uno de los cantantes de mayor éxito de los años noventa. El artista de Chicago, que ya fue condenado el pasado junio a treinta años de cárcel por crimen organizado y abuso y tráfico sexual, ahora suma una nueva condena por pornografía infantil y abuso sexual de menores. El veredicto del jurado en el Tribunal de Distrito en Chicago se produjo después de que los miembros del jurado deliberaran durante 11 horas durante dos días.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, de 55 años, está ahora a la espera de sentencia pero pasará con toda probabilidad el resto de su vida en la prisión de Nueva York donde está encarcelado (y donde ya ha sido agredido por otro recluso), tras haber sido hallado culpable de seis de los trece cargos que se le imputaban, tres de ellos relacionados con la pornografía infantil y otros tres por persuadir a menores para tener sexo con ellos. En Chicago, una condena por un solo cargo de pornografía infantil conlleva una sentencia mínima obligatoria de 10 años. Sin embargo, ha sido absuelto de otros siete cargos que incluían obstrucción a la justicia y conspiración para recibir pornografía infantil.
En 2008, Kelly fue juzgado por un vídeo de treinta minutos en el que se ve abusando de una niña de 14 años, pero la víctima, conocida por el seudónimo de 'Jane', se negó a testificar ante el tribunal y el jurado finalmente lo absolvió de todos los cargos. Jane, que ahora tiene 37 años, sí testificó el mes pasado y declaró que ella es la persona del vídeo, y que Kelly había abusado sexualmente de ella cientos de veces antes de que cumpliera 18 años.
Esa cinta y otras dos fueron mostradas al jurado durante el juicio. Otras cuatro mujeres acusaron al cantante de abusar de ellas cuando eran niñas, y más de 30 testigos declararon. Durante las exposiciones finales del lunes, que incluyeron descripciones gráficas de abuso infantil, un miembro del jurado sufrió un ataque de pánico y tuvo que ser reemplazado por un jurado suplente.
La fiscal federal adjunta Elizabeth Pozolo describió cómo el video muestra a Kelly orinando sobre la niña. «Ese acto degradante ha quedado capturado para siempre en ese vídeo. Ese abuso se recuerda para siempre. Y, ¿quién hace algo así? ¿Quién usa a una niña de 14 años para filmar un vídeo como este? Este hombre. Robert Kelly». Después de que se dictara la sentencia, la jueza Ann Donnelly se dirigió directamente a Kelly y le dijo: «Estos crímenes fueron calculados y planeados cuidadosamente, y ejecutados regularmente durante casi 25 años. Les enseñaste a tus víctimas que el amor es esclavitud y violencia».
Sus abogados intentaron reducir la condena alegando que había sufrido abusos en su infancia
Después de leerse el veredicto, la abogada de Kelly, Jennifer Bonjean, ha criticado a los fiscales asegurando que habían acusado a su defendido de «cargos que no podían ganar», y asegura que los miembros del jurado habían hecho su trabajo al absolver a Kelly de la mitad de las acusaciones: «Obviamente no estamos celebrando una victoria, pero estamos contentos de que el jurado analice cada cosa por separado».
En el juicio anterior, celebrado en Nueva York, los fiscales llamaron a declarar a 45 testigos y presentaron cientos de pruebas escritas y grabadas en vídeo y audio del abuso al que Kelly sometió a sus víctimas, y «a la luz de la gravedad de los delitos, la necesidad de que sirva como disuasión y la necesidad de proteger al público de nuevos delitos del acusado», solicitaron a la juez una sentencia superior a los 25 años, y una multa de entre 50.000 y 250.000 dólares (que finalmente quedó en 100.000 dólares). Los abogados del artista pidieron que la sentencia no superara los 10 años, alegando que el acusado había pasado una «infancia traumática» al descubrirse «evidencias de una historia de abusos sexuales por miembros de la familia y no familiares».
En aquel proceso judicial quedó demostrado que Kelly traficaba con mujeres para someterlas a abusos sexuales entre diferentes estados de Estados Unidos, y que fue ayudado por managers, guardias de seguridad y otros miembros de su séquito. El tribunal consideró probado que había obtenido documentos ilegalmente para casarse con la cantante Aaliyah cuando tenía 15 años en 1994. El matrimonio se anuló meses después, pero a los siete años ella murió en un misterioso accidente aéreo, cuando la avioneta bimotor Cessna 402 en la que viajaba se estrelló poco después de despegar del aeropuerto de Marsh Harbour en las Islas Ábaco de las Bahamas, matando al piloto y a los ocho pasajeros a bordo.
R. Kelly publicó trece discos de los que vendió más de cien millones de copias, y es poseedor de tres premios Grammy. Ahora, su música ha sido retirada de todas las plataformas de streaming y él vive aislado en un régimen de vigilancia para evitar su suicidio.",2022-09-15T08:31:48Z,https://www.abc.es,ABC
"R. Kelly convicted on many child porn counts, acquitted of trial fixing","By MICHAEL TARM and JOEY CAPPELLETTI
CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury in Chicago convicted R. Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a monthlong trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to the Grammy Award winning singer who was once one of the world’s biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six of the 13 counts against him, with many of the convictions carrying long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count — that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid — who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly’s believability — were acquitted of all charges.
The trial was, in ways, a do-over of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both. Kelly, who shed tears of joy when jurors acquitted him in 2008, gave a thumbs-up sign to spectators after Wednesday’s verdict but otherwise showed little emotion.
Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar.
Asked by reporters later outside court how Kelly felt after the verdict, his lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said: “Mr. Kelly is used to bad news.”
“He’s still got many fights to fight,” she said. “But what he did say is that he had a sense of relief that this particular case was in the past now.”
The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.
And two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly — one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Chicago-based U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed satisfaction with the verdict. He told reporters that, when you add up the potential punishments on the six guilty counts, Kelly was staring at at least 10 years and up to 90 in prison.
Judge Harry Leinenweber did not set a sentencing date. He could order that Kelly serve whatever sentence he imposes simultaneously with the New York sentence or only after that one is fully served. The latter would, for practical purposes, mean a life sentence.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Some dozen Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Bonjean, Kelly’s attorney, told jurors in her closings that the government had relied, in some cases, on liars and and blackmailers as witnesses. She earlier implored jurors not to see Kelly as “the monster” she said prosecutors so badly wanted them to see.
In her closing rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
All four Kelly accusers who testified went by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, didn’t testify, and jurors acquitted Kelly of the one charge related to her.
Four of his six convictions were tied directly to Jane and relied largely on her testimony.
She was the government’s star witness and also pivotal to the trial fixing charge, of which he was acquitted, and which accused him of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial. Three of the child porn charges that Kelly was convicted of Wednesday were related to that video and others depicting Jane.
Jane, 37, said publicly for the first time at the just-ended trial that the girl in the video was her at age 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify.
Asked on the witness stand how many times Jane and Kelly had sexually abused her before she turned 18, Jane answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. Soon after that, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly recorded the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. She told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ’em. Period.”

R. Kelly: Ένοχος για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση της 14χρονης βαφτισιμιάς του- Παρουσιάστηκε βίντεο που ουρεί πάνω της,"Ο R. Kelly, καταδικάστηκε χθες για σεξουαλικά εγκλήματα σε βάρος ανηλίκων καθώς το δικαστήριο αποφάνθηκε ότι αυτός απεικονίζεται σε τρία βίντεο όπου κακοποιεί σεξουαλικά τη 14χρονη βαφτιστήρα του.
Το δικαστήριο καταδίκασε τον 55χρονο ράπερ για 6 από τις 13 κατηγορίες εναντίον του μετά από δίκη 4 εβδομάδων στην γενέτειρά του το Σικάγο.
Το 2008 ο Kelly είχε αθωωθεί για την κατηγορία της παιδικής πορνογραφίας. Υπενθυμίζεται ότι πέρυσι, ο ράπερ είχε καταδικαστεί για sex trafficking από δικαστήριο της Νέας Υόρκης και του επιβλήθηκε ποινή φυλάκισης 30 ετών.
Η τελευταία καταδικαστική απόφαση αναμένεται προσθέσει χρόνια φυλάκισης στην ποινή του. Ο ράπερ, του οποίου το πραγματικό του όνομα είναι Robert Sylvester Kelly, κρίθηκε ένοχος χθες για τρεις κατηγορίες δελεασμού ανηλίκων για σεξ και τρεις κατηγορίες για παραγωγή υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας.
Το δικαστήριο τον έκρινε αθώο για παρεμπόδιση της δικαιοσύνης σχετικά με τη δίκη του το 2008, η οποία κατέληξε σε αθώωση.
Δύο από τους πρώην συνεργάτες του, οι οποίοι επίσης κατηγορήθηκαν στην δίκη του 2008, ήταν συγκατηγορούμενοι στην υπόθεση αλλά αθωώθηκαν από όλες τις κατηγορίες.
Η δίκη του 2008 είχε επικεντρωθεί σε ένα 30λεπτό βίντεο όπου φέρεται να κακοποιεί σεξουαλικά μία 14χρονη κοπέλα, η οποία ήταν βαφτιστήρα του.
Το θύμα, με το ψευδώνυμο Jane, αρνήθηκε να καταθέσει στο δικαστήριο πριν από 14 χρόνια και τότε όλοι οι ένορκοι τον είχαν αθωώσει από όλες τις κατηγορίες.
Αλλά, η 37χρονη σήμερα Jane, κατέθεσε τον περασμένο μήνα ότι αυτή απεικονίζεται στο επίμαχο βίντεο. Κατέθεσε ότι ο Kelly την είχε κακοποιήσει σεξουαλικά εκατοντάδες φορές πριν εκείνη γίνει 18 ετών.
Είπε ότι ο ράπερ την είχε πείσει τότε να μην καταθέσει ενώ στο δικαστήριο παρουσιάστηκαν και στοιχεία για πληρωμές στη γυναίκα και την οικογένειά της για αρκετά χρόνια, υποστηρίζοντας ότι τα χρήματα είχαν σκοπό να τους αποσιωπήσουν.
Το επίμαχο βίντεο μαζί με δύο ακόμα προβλήθηκαν στους ενόρκους κατά τη διάρκεια της δίκης.
Τρεις άλλες γυναίκες κατέθεσαν στη δίκη, λέγοντας ότι ο ράπερ τις κακοποίησε σεξουαλικά όταν ήταν ανήλικες ενώ μία ακόμα γυναίκα που αναμενόταν να καταθέσει δεν εμφανίστηκε στο δικαστήριο. Εναντίον του κατέθεσαν περισσότεροι από 30 μάρτυρες.
Κατά το κλείσιμο της δίκης τη Δευτέρα, όπου παρουσιάστηκαν αποδεικτικά στοιχεία κακοποίησης ανηλίκων, μία από τους ενόρκους υπέστη κρίση πανικού.
Αποσύρθηκε και αντικαταστάθηκε. Η βοηθός εισαγγελέα των ΗΠΑ Ελίζαμπεθ Ποζόλο περιέγραψε πώς στο βίντεο φαίνεται ο Kelly να ουρεί πάνω στο κορίτσι.
«Αυτή η ταπεινωτική πράξη αποτυπώνεται σε αυτό το βίντεο», είπε, προσθέτοντας πως «Αυτή η κακοποίηση θα υπάρχει για πάντα στη μνήμη όλων».
«Ποιος το κάνει αυτό;» συνέχισε «Ποιος χρησιμοποιεί ένα 14χρονο παιδί για να γυρίσει ένα βίντεο σαν αυτό; Αυτός ο άνθρωπος. Ο Robert Kelly».
Στη δίκη του Kelly στη Νέα Υόρκη τον περασμένο Σεπτέμβριο, οι ένορκοι άκουσαν πώς ο ράπερ διακινούσε γυναίκες για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση μεταξύ διαφορετικών πολιτειών των ΗΠΑ, με τη βοήθεια διευθυντών, φρουρών ασφαλείας και άλλων μελών της συνοδείας του.
Πέρυσι στο δικαστήριο ακούστηκε ακόμα ότι ο Kelly είχε αποκτήσει με παράνομο τρόπο έγγραφα για να παντρευτεί την τραγουδίστρια Aaliyah όταν εκείνη ήταν 15 ετών το 1994, επτά χρόνια πριν πεθάνει σε αεροπορικό δυστύχημα.
Το πιστοποιητικό, που διέρρευσε, ανέφερε την ηλικία της Aaliyah ως 18. Ο γάμος ακυρώθηκε μήνες αργότερα.
Ο βραβευμένος με Grammy, Kelly βρίσκεται ακόμα αντιμέτωπος με κατηγορίες για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση στο Ιλινόις και για πορνεία και παρενόχληση στη Μινεσότα.

"Cântăreţul R. Kelly, găsit vinovat de pornografie infantilă","Cântăreţul R. Kelly, găsit vinovat de pornografie infantilă
R. Kelly, starul R&B condamnat în iunie la 30 de ani de închisoare pentru infracţiuni sexuale comise asupra unor tinere, unele dintre ele adolescente, a fost găsit vinovat miercuri la Chicago de pornografie infantilă.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, în vârstă de 55 de ani, a fost condamnat pentru producerea de pornografie infantilă şi corupere de minori, conform AFP.
Cântăreţul, celebru în întreaga lume pentru hitul său ""I Believe I Can Fly"" şi pentru cele 75 de milioane de discuri vândute, a fost însă achitat de un juriu federal pentru alte acuzaţii de obstrucţionare a justiţiei.
El şi doi foşti asociaţi - de asemenea achitaţi miercuri - au fost acuzaţi de perturbarea procesului său din 2008 pentru pornografia infantilă, în care juriul l-a găsit nevinovat.
Aceştia au fost acuzaţi că au ameninţat şi corupt o victimă, care nu a depus mărturie atunci. În prezent în vârstă de 37 de ani, de data aceasta victima a vorbit.
În timpul procesului au fost prezentate fragmente de înregistrări cu violenţele sexuale comise de R. Kelly asupra unor tinere, dintre care una având doar 14 ani.
Juriul format din 12 persoane a avut nevoie de aproximativ 11 ore pentru a ajunge la acest verdict, care ar putea adăuga o pedeapsă grea cu închisoarea celor 30 de ani de detenţie pe care R. Kelly i-a primit deja.
Sentinţa sa, care va fi stabilită ulterior, ar putea fi cuprinsă între ""10 şi 90 de ani de închisoare"", a precizat parchetul într-un comunicat.
Artistul fusese deja găsit vinovat în septembrie 2021 la New York pentru că a condus timp de trei decenii un ""sistem"" de exploatare sexuală a tinerelor, dintre care unele adolescente.
Procesul a fost considerat o etapă majoră a mişcării #MeToo: a fost pentru prima dată când majoritatea reclamantelor au fost femei de culoare, iar cel pe care-l acuzau, un interpret de culoare.
Zeci de ani, succesul lui R. Kelly a fost afectat de suspiciuni persistente de violenţe sexuale, pe care artistul reuşise să le reducă la tăcere prin acorduri financiare care includeau clauze de confidenţialitate.
Încă din 2017, două femei, Kenyette Barnes şi Oronike Odeleye, au făcut apel la boicotarea cântecelor sale, distribuind hashtag-ul ""Mute R. Kelly"".
În ianuarie 2019, în serialul documentar ""Surviving R. Kelly"", mai multe victime l-au descris pe cântăreţ ca manipulator, violent şi obsedat de fete foarte tinere.
În timpul procesului de la New York, victimele au descris tacticile folosite de cântăreţ pentru a atrage femei foarte tinere, folosindu-se de faima sa şi cu complicitatea anturajului său.
Multe dintre acestea l-au întâlnit pe Kelly la concerte, după care li se strecura un bilet cu datele de contact ale lui Kelly, alături de promisiunea de a fi sprijinite în carierele lor muzicale. În schimb, ele erau ""îndoctrinate"" în mediul ""sordid"" al lui Kelly, constrânse să întreţină raporturi sexuale şi menţinute în acest ""sistem"" prin ""măsuri coercitive"", potrivit acuzării.

I suoi avvocati in quel caso avevano tentato di ottenere una pena meno severa tirando in ballo gli abusi che lo stesso cantante avrebbe subito anche in famiglia durante l'infanzia.
Chi è R. Kelly
Kelly è un cantante, compositore e produttore discografico originario di Chicago. Deve la sua fama alla canzone I Believe I Can Fly, uscita nel 1996 e inserita nella colonna sonora del film Space Jam. Il brano era stato composto appositamente per il film, poi è stato inserito anche nell'album del cantante, intitolato R. e uscito nel 1998. Il singolo ha avuto un successo enorme e ha fruttato 3 Grammy Awards al cantante. Dopo alcuni album con buoni risultati di vendita, nel 2002 iniziano i guai. Kelly viene trovato in possesso di materiale pedopornografico e l’ex moglie, Andrea Lee, madre dei suoi tre figli, presenta un ordine restrittivo nei confronti di Kelly dopo un’aggressione. Nel 2008 R. Kelly viene giudicato non colpevole per insufficienza di prove. Infine nel 2018 sono arrivate le accuse per reati sessuali.",2022-09-15T07:36:20Z,https://tg24.sky.it,Sky Tg24 
R. Kelly erneut wegen Kinderpornografie verurteilt: Langjährige Haft,"Sänger R. Kelly, hier bei einer Anhörung im September 2019, muss sich vor Gericht erneut wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs verantworten.

Neue Wendung im Fall R. Kelly (55): Der US-Musiker ist in einem weiteren Prozess wegen Kinderpornografie schuldig gesprochen worden. Ein Gericht in Chicago befand den früheren R&B-Star am Mittwoch (14. September 2022, Ortszeit) der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie sowie der Verführung Minderjähriger schuldig.
Allerdings wurde Kelly von sieben weiteren Anklagepunkten, darunter Behinderung der Justiz in einem vorangegangenen Verfahren, freigesprochen. Nach seiner Verurteilung zu 30 Jahren Haft in einem Verfahren in New York droht dem 55-Jährigen nun eine weitere lange Gefängnisstrafe. Die Geschworenen trafen ihren Schuldspruch nach einer elfstündigen Beratung.
US-Star R. Kelly droht weitere Haftstrafe
Kelly und zwei früheren Mitarbeitern war in dem Prozess in Chicago vorgeworfen worden, einen Kinderpornografie-Prozess gegen den Musiker im Jahr 2008 manipuliert zu haben. Auch die Ex-Mitarbeiter wurden von diesen Vorwürfen freigesprochen.
Im Juni war der mit dem Hit „I Believe I Can Fly“ zum Star gewordene Kelly in New York wegen schwerer Sexualverbrechen zu 30 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt worden. Laut Anklage hatte Kelly ein ganzes Netzwerk von Helfern aufgebaut, um junge Mädchen und Frauen zur Befriedigung seiner sexuellen Gelüste zu rekrutieren. Seine Opfer soll er teils eingesperrt und brutal missbraucht haben.

In dem ersten Prozess in Chicago im Jahr 2008 hatte ein Opfer nach Drohungen und Bestechung seine Aussage verweigert. Diesmal jedoch war die inzwischen 37-Jährige in den Zeugenstand getreten. Mit dem jetzigen Schuldspruch könne Kelly für den sexuellen Missbrauch einer 14-Jährigen zur Verantwortung und im ersten Prozess begangenes Unrecht wieder gutgemacht werden, sagte Staatsanwalt John Lausch.
Der Schaden, den Kelly seinen Opfern zugefügt habe, sei „unermesslich“, erklärte Lausch. Den Opfern gebühre Dank für ihre „Stärke, Beharrlichkeit und ihren Mut“, vor Gericht auszusagen.
Gegen den Sänger waren bereits vor rund 25 Jahren erste Vorwürfe laut geworden. Für Aufsehen sorgte außerdem Kellys später annullierte Ehe mit der damals erst 15 Jahre alten Sängerin Aaliyah.

No entanto, o júri absolveu o artista de uma quarta acusação de pornografia, bem como uma acusação de conspiração para obstruir a justiça, acusando-o de consertar o seu julgamento de pornografia infantil em 2008.
R. Kelly foi considerado inocente em todas as três acusações de conspiração para receber pornografia infantil e por duas incriminações de aliciamento.

Os seus corréus, Derrel McDavid e Milton Brown, foram considerados inocentes de todas as acusações.
No julgamento, os procuradores tentaram retratar o cantor como um mestre manipulador que usou a sua fama e riqueza para atrair fãs, incluindo alguns menores de idade, abusando sexualmente deles e depois descartá-los.
Nascido Robert Sylvester Kelly, o artista estava desesperado para recuperar os vídeos pornográficos infantis que produzia e guardava numa mochila de ginástica, disseram testemunhas.
Testemunhas indicaram que R. Kelly ofereceu até um milhão de dólares (cerca de um milhão de euros) para recuperar vídeos perdidos antes do seu julgamento de 2008, sabendo que o colocariam em perigo.
A conspiração para esconder os seus abusos ocorreu entre 2000 e 2020, atentaram os procuradores.
R. Kelly já havia sido condenado por extorsão e tráfico sexual em Nova Iorque e condenado a 30 anos de prisão.
Em Chicago, uma condenação de apenas uma acusação de pornografia infantil acarreta uma sentença mínima obrigatória de 10 anos, enquanto a receção de pornografia infantil determina um mínimo obrigatório de cinco anos.",2022-09-15T07:15:00Z,https://www.jn.pt,Jornal de Notícias
"American singer R. Kelly convicted of child porn, enticing girls for sex","Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar.
A federal jury in Chicago convicted R. Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a monthlong trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to the Grammy Award winning singer who was once one of the world’s biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six of the 13 counts against him, with many of the convictions carrying long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count — that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid — who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly’s believability — were acquitted of all charges.
The trial was, in ways, a do-over of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both. Kelly, who shed tears of joy when jurors acquitted him in 2008, gave a thumbs-up sign to spectators after Wednesday’s verdict but otherwise showed little emotion.
Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar.
Asked by reporters later outside court how Kelly felt after the verdict, his lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said: “Mr. Kelly is used to bad news.”
“He’s still got many fights to fight,” she said. “But what he did say is that he had a sense of relief that this particular case was in the past now.”
The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.
And two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly — one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Chicago-based U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed satisfaction with the verdict. He told reporters that, when you add up the potential punishments on the six guilty counts, Kelly was staring at at least 10 years and up to 90 in prison.
Judge Harry Leinenweber did not set a sentencing date. He could order that Kelly serve whatever sentence he imposes simultaneously with the New York sentence or only after that one is fully served. The latter would, for practical purposes, mean a life sentence.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Some dozen Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Bonjean, Kelly’s attorney, told jurors in her closings that the government had relied, in some cases, on liars and and blackmailers as witnesses. She earlier implored jurors not to see Kelly as “the monster” she said prosecutors so badly wanted them to see.
In her closing rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
All four Kelly accusers who testified went by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, didn’t testify, and jurors acquitted Kelly of the one charge related to her.
Four of his six convictions were tied directly to Jane and relied largely on her testimony.
She was the government’s star witness and also pivotal to the trial fixing charge, of which he was acquitted, and which accused him of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial. Three of the child porn charges that Kelly was convicted of Wednesday were related to that video and others depicting Jane.
Jane, 37, said publicly for the first time at the just-ended trial that the girl in the video was her at age 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify.
Asked on the witness stand how many times Jane and Kelly had sexually abused her before she turned 18, Jane answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. Soon after that, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly recorded the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. She told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ’em. Period.”

R. Kelly wegen Kinderpornografie verurteilt - unter anderem,"Der Musiker R. Kelly nach einer Anhörung in Chicago. Bild: Matt Marton/FR170980 AP/dpa
Der US-Popstar R. Kelly ist bereits wegen Sexualdelikten in Haft. Jetzt hat ihn eine Jury erneut in 6 von 13 Anklagepunkten schuldig gesprochen. Es droht erneut eine mehrere Jahrzehnte lange Haftstrafe.
Jahrzehntelang schien es so, als sei R. Kelly trotz zahlreicher kursierender Geschichten über Sex mit Minderjährigen unangreifbar. Doch die Vergangenheit holte ihn schliesslich ein – und eine Jury befand ihn erneut für schuldig.
Der Ex-Popstar ist erneut wegen Sexualstraftaten verurteilt worden. Eine Jury in Chicago befand den 55-Jährigen am Mittwoch schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben, wie US-Medien am Mittwoch übereinstimmend berichteten.
Erst vor einigen Wochen war der «I Believe I Can Fly»-Sänger in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen des Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt worden. In einem zweiten Prozess in Chicago war er in 13 Punkten angeklagt, unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen und der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen.
Die Geschworenen sprachen R. Kelly in 7 Punkten frei
Laut «New York Times» sprachen die zwölf Geschworenen ihn in sieben Punkten frei – unter anderem vom Vorwurf der Behinderung der Justiz. Das Strafmass wird zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt verkündet, Kelly droht erneut eine mehrere Jahrzehnte lange Haftstrafe. Kelly hatte die Vorwürfe stets zurückgewiesen. Er sitzt seit Sommer 2019 im Gefängnis. Zwei weitere angeklagte Ex-Angestellte Kellys wurden freigesprochen.
In Chicago ging es auch um ein bereits viele Jahre bekanntes Video, das Kelly zeigen soll, wie er ein 14-jähriges Mädchen missbraucht und auf sie uriniert. In diesem Fall war der Musiker 2008 von einer Jury bereits freigesprochen worden.
Die Staatsanwaltschaft hatte ihm vorgeworfen, das Opfer unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit sie nicht in dem Prozess aussagt. In dem neuen Prozess hatte die mittlerweile volljährige Frau aber bestätigt, dass sie die Person in dem Video ist.
Der Musik-Koloss schien unangreifbar
Das Verfahren ist – nach Fällen wie denen von Filmproduzent Harvey Weinstein und Komiker Bill Cosby – eine weitere viel beachtete juristische Aufarbeitung in der #MeToo-Ära. Erste Anschuldigungen gegen den 1967 in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborenen Musiker wurden bereits vor rund 25 Jahren bekannt.
Doch der Musik-Koloss schien unangreifbar auf seinem Pop-Thron und blieb lange Zeit auf freiem Fuss. Mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben, mehreren Grammys und anderen Auszeichnungen gehörte er zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern des späten 20. Jahrhunderts.
Aber spätestens als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation «Surviving R. Kelly» die Anschuldigungen zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer. Stars distanzierten sich von ihm, zudem Radiosender, Streaming-Dienste und dann auch sein Musiklabel RCA, das zu Sony Music gehört.

Le chanteur R. Kelly reconnu coupable de pédopornographie,"Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 ans, a été condamné pour production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur.
Le chanteur, mondialement connu pour son tube ""I Believe I Can Fly"" et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, a en revanche été acquitté par un jury fédéral pour d'autres chefs d'inculpation d'obstruction à la justice.
Lui et deux anciens associés - également acquittés mercredi - étaient accusés d'avoir perturbé le cours de son procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, au cours duquel le jury l'avait déclaré non coupable.
Il leur était reproché d'avoir à la fois menacé et corrompu une victime, qui n'avait alors pas témoigné. Aujourd'hui âgée de 37 ans, elle s'est cette fois exprimée.
Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur des jeunes filles, dont l'une n'avait que 14 ans, ont été diffusés pendant le procès.
Le jury composé de 12 personnes a mis environ 11 heures pour parvenir à ce verdict, qui pourrait venir ajouter une lourde peine de prison aux 30 ans de réclusion auxquels R. Kelly a déjà été condamné.
Sa peine, qui sera fixée ultérieurement, pourrait aller ""de dix à 90 ans de prison"", a précisé le bureau du procureur dans un communiqué.
Le verdict ""oblige Robert Kelly à rendre des comptes pour les violences sexuelles commises sur une adolescente de 14 ans"", a déclaré le procureur John Lausch.
""Les souffrances infligées par M. Kelly à ses victimes sont immenses"", a-t-il ajouté, saluant la ""force, la détermination et le courage"" de celles qui ont témoigné lors du procès.
Système
L'artiste avait déjà été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 à New York d'avoir piloté pendant trois décennies un ""système"" d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes.
Ce procès avait été considéré comme une étape majeure du mouvement #MeToo: c'était la première fois que la majorité des plaignantes étaient des femmes noires et qu'elles accusaient un artiste noir.
Pendant des décennies, le succès de R. Kelly avait été terni par des soupçons de violences sexuelles, objet de rumeurs persistantes. Il était longtemps parvenu à les faire taire avec des accords financiers prévoyant des clauses de confidentialité.
Dès 2017, deux femmes, Kenyette Barnes et Oronike Odeleye, avaient lancé un appel au boycott de ses chansons, en partageant le hashtag ""Mute R. Kelly"" (""Faites taire R. Kelly"").
En janvier 2019, la série documentaire ""Surviving R. Kelly"" avait enfoncé le clou. Plusieurs victimes y décrivaient le chanteur comme manipulateur, violent et obsédé par les très jeunes filles.
Lors du procès à New York, les victimes avaient décrit les tactiques utilisées par le chanteur pour attirer de très jeunes femmes en se servant de sa célébrité, et avec la complicité de son entourage.
Beaucoup d'entre elles avaient rencontré la star à des concerts, après lesquels on leur glissait un petit papier indiquant les coordonnées de R. Kelly.
Il ferait quelque chose pour leur carrière musicale, leur promettait-on.
Au lieu de cela, elles se faisaient ""endoctriner"" dans le milieu ""sordide"" de R. Kelly, étaient forcées à des rapports sexuels et maintenues dans ce ""système"" par des ""mesures coercitives"", selon l'accusation.
Le chanteur était parvenu à se hisser jusqu'au sommet de l'industrie musicale malgré sa vie personnelle tumultueuse, et notamment son mariage - ensuite annulé - avec sa protégée de 15 ans, la chanteuse Aaliyah.
R. Kelly avait écrit et produit le premier album de l'artiste décédée en 2001, ""Age Ain't Nothin' But A Number"" (""L'âge n'est rien d'autre qu'un chiffre"").",2022-09-15T06:37:00Z,https://www.varmatin.com,Var-Matin
R Kelly: Disgraced former R&B star convicted of child porn and sex abuse charges,"A federal jury has convicted R Kelly of several child pornography and sex abuse charges in his hometown of Chicago.
Kelly, 55, once one of the world’s biggest R&B stars, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement.
But the jury acquitted him on a fourth pornography count as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him of fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008.
He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges.
His two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges.
Jurors, who deliberated for 11 hours over two days, wrote several questions to the judge on Wednesday, at least one indicating the panellists were grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.
At trial, prosecutors sought to paint a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover child pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to one million dollars to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted Mr McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Mr Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Kelly has already been convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
In Chicago, a conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum of five years.
Judges can order that defendants sentenced earlier in separate cases serve their new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences.
During closing arguments on Tuesday, Kelly lawyer Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors.
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said of the prosecution’s case.
The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days. Co-defendant Mr McDavid, who was on the stand for three days, may have damaged Kelly’s hopes for acquittal by saying that he now doubts Kelly was truthful when he denied abusing anyone after hearing the superstar’s accusers testify.
In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Four Kelly accusers testified, all referred to by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify.
Sitting nearby in a suit and face mask, Kelly often averted his eyes and looked down as his accusers spoke.
Some dozen die-hard Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Jane, 37, was the government’s star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents would not testify.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial.
On the witness stand for two days at the end of August, Jane paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue when she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her aged 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video did not testify. At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane said she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video, saying part of her reason for lying was that she cared for Kelly and did not want to get him into trouble.
Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. ... Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defence lawyers suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 - the age of consent in Illinois - when Kelly began pursuing her for sex.
Ms Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster”, saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray.
“Mr Kelly can also be a victim,” she said in her opening statement.",2022-09-15T06:18:33Z,https://www.standard.co.uk,Evening Standard
Celebrul artist R&B Robert Kelly a fost condamnat într-un caz de abuz sexual. Exclusiv videoclipul care l-a trimis după gratii.,"Starul muzicii R&B, R. Kelly, în vârstă de 55 de ani, execută deja o pedeapsă de 30 de ani de închisoare după ce un juriu din Brooklyn l-a condamnat anul trecut pentru acuzații de șantaj și trafic sexual – prima dată când a fost tras la răspundere penală pentru abuz sexual, în ciuda unor acuzații care datează de mai bine de trei decenii. Condamnarea din Chicago ar putea adăuga ani la această pedeapsă cu închisoarea.
Juriul format din 12 persoane în procesul din Chicago l-a condamnat pe R. Kelly pentru șase din cele 13 acuzații aduse împotriva sa, inclusiv trei capete de acuzare pentru constrângerea minorilor la activități sexuale și trei pentru producerea de înregistrări sexuale cu un minor. Însă, un eșec pentru procurori, el a fost achitat de acuzația că ar fi încercat să obstrucționeze o anchetă privind abuzurile sale asupra fetei minore și de alte două capete de acuzare pentru atragerea minorilor pentru a face sex.
„Suntem deosebit de mulțumiți că Robert Kelly este în sfârșit, în sfârșit, tras la răspundere pentru abuzul asupra finuței sale în vârstă de 14 ani”, a declarat John R. Lausch Jr., procurorul federal pentru Districtul de Nord din Illinois, după citirea verdictului, a menționat New York Times.
Achitat de aceleași acuzații anterior
Procesul federal de la Chicago a avut ecouri ale unui proces desfășurat în Illinois în 2008, în care un juriu l-a achitat pe R.Kelly de acuzațiile de producere de imagini cu abuzuri sexuale asupra copiilor. Acel proces s-a axat pe aceeași fată de 14 ani și pe o casetă video despre care procurorii au spus că îl arăta pe Kelly abuzând sexual și urinând pe ea. După ce l-au găsit nevinovat, unii jurați au declarat reporterilor că au fost afectați de lipsa mărturiei tinerei, care a negat în fața juriului că ea ar fi persoana din înregistrare.
Dar în timpul acestui proces, care a început în august la tribunalul american din centrul orașului Chicago, femeia a luat cuvântul, s-a identificat ca fiind tânăra din videoclip și a declarat că artistul a convins-o să mintă în fața marelui juriu. Procurorii au arătat juraților clipuri din acel videoclip și din alte două pe care le-au descris ca fiind imagini cu R. Kelly abuzând sexual de aceasta când era minoră. De asemenea, au prezentat dovezi privind plățile făcute femeii și familiei acesteia de-a lungul mai multor ani, susținând că banii erau destinați să îi facă să păstreze tăcerea în legătură cu abuzul.
Alte trei femei au depus mărturie în cadrul procesului, spunând că dl Kelly a abuzat sexual de ele când erau minore. O a cincea acuzatoare care era așteptată să depună mărturie nu s-a prezentat.
Artistul nu a depus mărturie
De asemenea, R. Kelly nu a depus mărturie la proces și și-a lăsat apărarea în mâinile avocatei sale Jennifer Bonjean, care a susținut că clientul său a fost urmărit penal din cauza unei mentalități generată de mișcarea #MeToo. Ea l-a descris pe R. Kelly ca fiind o „victimă a șantajului și a exploatării financiare”.
Dar, pe parcursul săptămânilor de proces, procurorii l-au prezentat pe cântărețukl R. Kelly ca pe un prădător sexual în serie care a mobilizat o serie de asociați pentru a ajuta la ascunderea crimelor sale. Un martor cheie al acuzării, Charles Freeman, a declarat că R.Kelly l-a sunat în 2001, cerându-i ajutorul pentru recuperarea unor „casete furate”. Freeman a declarat că, pe o perioadă de mai mulți ani, a primit sute de mii de dolari de la Kelly.
„Robert Kelly a abuzat de multe fete timp de mulți ani”, a declarat Elizabeth Pozolo, unul dintre procurori, în pledoaria finală a juriului. „El a comis crime oribile împotriva copiilor și nu a făcut-o singur”.
Complicii lui R. Kelly, achitați
Printre complicii lui Kelly, a susținut acuzarea, se numără doi dintre foștii săi angajați, ambii judecați alături de cântăreț, dar care au fost achitați de toate acuzațiile. Derrel McDavid, fostul manager de afaceri al domnului Kelly, a fost achitat de acuzațiile potrivit cărora ar fi aranjat plățile către persoanele care încercau să recupereze videoclipurile dispărute. Milton Brown, un alt fost angajat, a fost acuzat că a încercat să recupereze imaginile cu abuzuri sexuale asupra copiilor ca parte a unui efort de a-l proteja pe R. Kelly, dar juriul l-a achitat pe Brown și de această acuzație.
Avocații ambilor bărbați au susținut că nu făceau decât să își facă treaba, conform indicațiilor dlui Kelly, și că nu aveau niciun motiv să creadă că benzile pe care li s-a cerut să le recupereze implicau o fată minoră (iar dna Bonjean a afirmat că benzile înfățișau doar adulți care și-au dat consimțimântul pentru a fi filmați).
Echipa de apărare a lui Kelly a încercat să pună la îndoială credibilitatea femeilor care au depus mărturie împotriva sa, prezentându-le ca fiind motivate de bani și de autoprotecție. Avocata Bonjean a subliniat faptul că femeia aflată în centrul procesului din 2008 are acum un acord de imunitate cu procurorii care o protejează de acuzațiile de sperjur legate de faptul că a mințit marele juriu la vremea respectivă.",2022-09-15T06:18:12Z,https://evz.ro,EVENIMENTUL ZILEI

R Kelly found guilty in child pornography case for filming himself sexually abusing goddaughter,"Follow us on Image Source : INSTAGRAM/MONEYMASONMEMES R Kelly
A Chicago federal jury found singer R. Kelly guilty of three counts of child pornography for filming himself sexually abusing his then-14-year-old goddaughter. According to the Chicago Tribune, of the indictment's 13 charges, Kelly was also found guilty of three counts of child sex trafficking through coercion and enticement, reports 'Variety'.
He was acquitted on charges that he conspired to obstruct justice in his 2002 Cook County case. Additionally, he was acquitted on two counts of receiving child pornography and one count of conspiring to receive child pornography.
The verdict delivered on Wednesday follows the testimony of Kelly's goddaughter, who went by the pseudonym Jane. Three other women testified that Kelly had also recorded and kept tapes of himself sexually abusing them when they were underage.
There were two co-defendants in the proceedings, former employees Milton ""June"" Brown and Derrel McDavid.
Charges against them alleged a conspiracy to hide the videotapes and convince Jane to keep her sexual contact with Kelly private. Both Brown and McDavid were acquitted of all charges, including that they had conspired to receive child pornography, and that McDavid conspired to obstruct justice.
In closing arguments, Kelly's attorney Jennifer Bonjean claimed that Jane's parents were to blame for lying about her relationship with the singer and asserted this was not due to coercion, but because ""They condoned it.""
Kelly was convicted on enticement counts regarding witnesses Jane, Nia and Pauline (all pseudonyms), but was found not guilty on two others.
Jurors acquitted Kelly of the alleged enticement counts in relation to another woman Tracy, one of the only witnesses whose age at the time of her alleged meetings with Kelly was challenged by defence attorneys. Jurors also acquitted Kelly on one count of enticement related to Brittany, whom prosecutors had originally planned to take the stand. That did not happen for reasons that remain unclear.
Jane joined the investigation just three years ago, after the airing of the 2019 Lifetime docuseries ""Surviving R. Kelly."" In her June verdict, Jane testified that it was her on the videotapes and that Kelly had sexually abused her multiple times as a minor.
Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June after a jury declared him guilty of racketeering related to the sexual exploitation of children, kidnapping, and forced labour. He was also charged with eight counts of violating the Mann Act in a separate federal case in New York.

"R. Kelly, găsit vinovat de pornografie infantilă/ Cântărețul este deja condamnat la 30 de ani de închisoare pentru agresiuni sexuale","R. Kelly, găsit vinovat de pornografie infantilă/ Cântărețul este deja condamnat la 30 de ani de închisoare pentru agresiuni sexuale
R. Kelly, star R&B deja condamnat la 30 de ani de închisoare în iunie pentru agresiuni sexuale comise asupra femeilor, unele adolescente, a fost găsit vinovat miercuri de pornografie infantilă la Chicago. Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 de ani, a fost condamnat pentru pornografie infantilă şi corupere de minori, potrivit Chicago Tribune, transmite News.ro.
Cântăreţul, cunoscut în întreaga lume pentru hitul său „I Believe I Can Fly” şi pentru cele 75 de milioane de discuri vândute, a fost însă achitat de un juriu federal de alte acuzaţii de obstrucţionare a justiţiei. El şi doi foşti asociaţi – de asemenea achitaţi miercuri – au fost acuzaţi de perturbarea procesului său din 2008 pentru pornografie infantilă, în care juriul l-a găsit nevinovat. Aceştia au fost acuzaţi că au ameninţat şi au corupt o victimă, care nu a depus mărturie atunci. În prezent în vârstă de 37 de ani, de data aceasta ea a vorbit.
În timpul procesului au fost prezentate fragmente din videoclipuri care arată violenţa sexuală comisă de R. Kelly asupra tinerelor adolescente, dintre care una avea doar 14 ani. Cei 12 juraţi au avut nevoie de aproximativ 11 ore pentru a ajunge la acest verdict, care ar putea adăuga o pedeapsă grea de închisoare celor 30 de ani de închisoare la care a fost deja condamnat R. Kelly.
De zeci de ani, succesul lui R. Kelly fusese afectat de suspiciuni de violenţă sexuală. A reuşit să le reducă la tăcere prin acorduri financiare care includeau clauze de confidenţialitate. Încă din 2017, două femei, Kenyette Barnes şi Oronike Odeleye, au cerut boicotarea melodiilor sale, împărtăşind hashtag-ul „Mute R. Kelly”.
În ianuarie 2019, serialul documentar „Surviving R. Kelly” a prezentat mai multe victime care l-au descris pe cântăreţ ca fiind manipulator, violent şi obsedat de fetele foarte tinere. În timpul procesului de la New York, victimele descriseseră tacticile folosite de cântăreţ pentru a atrage femei foarte tinere, folosindu-se de celebritatea sa şi cu complicitatea celor din jur. Multe dintre ele îl cunoscusere la concerte, acolo unde li se strecura un bilet care indica datele de contact ale lui R. Kelly. Li se promitea că el ar face ceva pentru cariera lor muzicală. În schimb, ele au fost „îndoctrinate” în mediul lui R. Kelly, constrânse să întreţină raporturi sexuale şi ţinute în acel „sistem” prin „măsuri coercitive”, potrivit acuzării.
Cântăreţul reuşise să urce în vârful industriei muzicale, în ciuda vieţii sale personale tumultoase, inclusiv a căsătoriei sale – apoi anulate – cu protejata sa în vârstă de 15 ani, cântăreaţa Aaliyah. R. Kelly a scris şi produs albumul de debut al artistei decedate în 2001, „Age Ain’t Nothin’ But A Number”.

R.Kelly: US-Musiker erneut wegen Kinderpornografie schuldig gesprochen,"R. Kelly während des Prozesses. Im vergangenen Jahr wurde er in neun Anklagepunkten im Zusammenhang mit Vorwürfen verurteilt, nach denen er Minderjährige missbraucht und ausgebeutet haben soll.
US-Musiker R. Kelly wurde bereits zu einer Haftstrafe von 30 Jahren verurteilt. Jetzt wurde er erneut wegen Kinderpornografie schuldig gesprochen.
Der US-Musiker R. Kelly ist in einem weiteren Prozess wegen Kinderpornografie schuldig gesprochen worden. Ein Gericht in Chicago befand den früheren R&B-Star am Mittwoch (Ortszeit) der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie sowie der Verführung Minderjähriger schuldig.
Von sieben weiteren Anklagepunkten, darunter Behinderung der Justiz in einem vorangegangenen Verfahren, wurde Kelly freigesprochen. Nach seiner Verurteilung zu 30 Jahren Haft in einem Verfahren in New York droht dem 55-Jährigen nun eine weitere lange Gefängnisstrafe.
R. Kelly droht langjährige Haftstrafe
Kelly und zwei früheren Mitarbeitern war in dem Prozess in Chicago vorgeworfen worden, einen Kinderpornografie-Prozess gegen den Musiker im Jahr 2008 manipuliert zu haben. Auch die Ex-Mitarbeiter wurden von diesen Vorwürfen freigesprochen.
Die Geschworenen trafen ihren Schuldspruch nach elfstündigen Beratungen. Kelly droht damit eine weitere langjährige Haftstrafe.
Im Juni war der mit dem Hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"" zum Star gewordene Kelly in New York wegen schwerer Sexualverbrechen zu 30 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt worden. Laut Anklage hatte Kelly ein ganzes Netzwerk von Helfern aufgebaut, um junge Mädchen und Frauen zur Befriedigung seiner sexuellen Gelüste zu rekrutieren. Seine Opfer soll er teils eingesperrt und brutal missbraucht haben.
Erste Vorwürfe bereits vor 25 Jahren
In dem ersten Prozess in Chicago im Jahr 2008 hatte ein Opfer nach Drohungen und Bestechung seine Aussage verweigert. Diesmal jedoch war die inzwischen 37-Jährige in den Zeugenstand getreten. Mit dem jetzigen Schuldspruch könne Kelly für den sexuellen Missbrauch einer 14-Jährigen zur Verantwortung und im ersten Prozess begangenes Unrecht wieder gutgemacht werden, sagte Staatsanwalt John Lausch.
Der Schaden, den Kelly seinen Opfern zugefügt habe, sei ""unermesslich"", erklärte Lausch. Den Opfern gebühre Dank für ihre ""Stärke, Beharrlichkeit und ihren Mut"", vor Gericht auszusagen.
Gegen den Sänger waren bereits vor rund 25 Jahren erste Vorwürfe laut geworden. Für Aufsehen sorgte außerdem Kellys später annullierte Ehe mit der damals erst 15 Jahre alten Sängerin Aaliyah.

"R Kelly convicted of child porn, enticing girls for sex","A federal jury in Chicago convicted R Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a monthlong trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to the Grammy Award singer who was once one of the world’s biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six of the 13 counts against him, with many of the convictions carrying long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count — that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008. Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid — who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly’s believability — were acquitted of all charges.
The trial was, in ways, a do-over of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both. Kelly, who shed tears of joy when jurors acquitted him in 2008, gave a thumbs-up sign to spectators after Wednesday’s verdict but otherwise showed little emotion.
Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar.
Asked by reporters later outside court how Kelly felt after the verdict, his lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said: “Mr. Kelly is used to bad news.” “He’s still got many fights to fight,” she said. “But what he did say is that he had a sense of relief that this particular case was in the past now.” The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80. And two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly — one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.

Chicago-based US Attorney John Lausch expressed satisfaction with the verdict. He told reporters that, when you add up the potential punishments on the six guilty counts, Kelly was staring at at least 10 years and up to 90 in prison.
Judge Harry Leinenweber did not set a sentencing date. He could order that Kelly serve whatever sentence he imposes simultaneously with the New York sentence or only after that one is fully served. The latter would, for practical purposes, mean a life sentence.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.

Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said. Some dozen Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Bonjean, Kelly’s attorney, told jurors in her closings that the government had relied, in some cases, on liars and and blackmailers as witnesses. She earlier implored jurors not to see Kelly as “the monster” she said prosecutors so badly wanted them to see.
In her closing rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s. “And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said. All four Kelly accusers who testified went by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, didn’t testify, and jurors acquitted Kelly of the one charge related to her. Four of his six convictions were tied directly to Jane and relied largely on her testimony. She was the government’s star witness and also pivotal to the trial fixing charge, of which he was acquitted, and which accused him of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial. Three of the child porn charges that Kelly was convicted of Wednesday were related to that video and others depicting Jane. Jane, 37, said publicly for the first time at the just-ended trial that the girl in the video was her at age 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify. Asked on the witness stand how many times Jane and Kelly had sexually abused her before she turned 18, Jane answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”

Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. Soon after that, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.

Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.

Prosecutors have said Kelly recorded the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. She told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ’em. Period.”",2022-09-15T05:12:22Z,https://indianexpress.com,The Indian Express

El cantante de R&B caído en desgracia R. Kelly, que cumple una condena de 30 años por delitos sexuales, fue declarado culpable de pornografía infantil este miércoles después de un juicio de un mes en su ciudad natal de Chicago (Estados Unidos).
Robert Sylvester Kelly, de 55 años, fue condenado por tres cargos de producción de pornografía infantil y otros tres por captar a un menor para relaciones sexuales, informó el Chicago Tribune.
El tres veces ganador del premio Grammy fue absuelto por un jurado federal de otros siete cargos, incluidos los de obstrucción a la justicia en un juicio anterior, dijo el periódico.
Él y dos exsocios estaban acusados de obstruir un juicio por pornografía infantil en 2008 en el que un jurado le declaró inocente.
El exrepresentante de Kelly Derrel McDavid y un antiguo empleado, Milton ""June"" Brown, también fueron absueltos el miércoles de los cargos de obstrucción.
Se les acusaba de haber amenazado y corrompido a una víctima que entonces no entregó su testimonio. Pero la mujer que tiene ahora 37 años se expresó este miércoles.

Las pruebas contra R. Kelly
Extractos de videos en los que se ven actos de violencia sexual cometida por R. Kelly contra adolescentes, una de ellas de 14 años, fueron mostrados durante el proceso.
El jurado de 12 personas demoró unas 11 horas para llegar a un veredicto, que podría sumar una fuerte condena a los 30 años de encarcelamiento que ya recibió el cantante en Nueva York en septiembre por reclutar a adolescentes y mujeres para practicar sexo.
En el caso de Nueva York, el cantante de ""I Believe I Can Fly"" fue declarado culpable de ocho cargos de tráfico sexual y uno de extorsión.
La condena de R. Kelly en Nueva York, la primera en un juicio en el que la mayoría de las partes civiles eran mujeres negras, se consideró un punto de inflexión en el movimiento #MeToo.
Los debates arrojaron luz sobre el ""sistema"" de R. Kelly para atraer a jovencitas y violarlas, con la complicidad de personas de su entorno.
Muchas víctimas contaron que habían conocido a su ídolo en un concierto y después alguien había deslizado un pequeño papel con los datos de contacto del cantante.
Aunque se les prometía hacer despegar su carrera musical, lo que sucedía era que se les ""adoctrinaba"" y forzaba a tener relaciones sexuales, mantenidas en un sistema ""sórdido"" bajo ""medidas coercitivas"", según la acusación.
También se le procesa en otros dos estados.

R. Kelly Found Guilty on Multiple Counts in Chicago,"(Newser) – Disgraced, imprisoned R&B star R. Kelly has been found guilty on six out of 13 charges at his federal trial in Chicago and is now facing deeper disgrace and a longer prison sentence. The jury found Kelly guilty of three counts of sexual exploitation of a child via production of child pornography and three counts of enticement of a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity, NBC Chicago reports. He was acquitted on other child pornography and enticement counts, as well as one count of obstructing justice by trying to rig his 2008 child pornography trial. The jury deliberated for 11 hours over two days and sent the judge several questions on Wednesday.
Kelly's two co-defendants, former employees Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, were found not guilty on all charges, including child pornography charges connected to what prosecutors said were Kelly's attempts to recover videos that showed him abusing a 14-year-old girl, the AP reports. A 37-year-old woman testified that she was the girl in the video and that Kelly had persuaded her to lie to a grand jury in 2002, reports the New York Times. ""I no longer wanted to carry his lies,"" she testified. Kelly is already serving a 30-year federal sentence for racketeering and sex trafficking, and the Chicago convictions could add years to his sentences.

Ex-Popstar R. Kelly ist erneut wegen Sexualstraftaten verurteilt worden. Eine Jury in Chicago befand den 55-Jährigen am Mittwoch schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben, wie US-Medien am Mittwoch übereinstimmend berichteten.
Erst vor einigen Wochen war der ""I believe I can fly""-Sänger in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen des Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt worden. In einem zweiten Prozess in Chicago war er in 13 Punkten angeklagt, unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen und der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen.
Laut ""New York Times"" sprachen die zwölf Geschworenen ihn in 7 Punkten frei - unter anderem vom Vorwurf der Behinderung der Justiz. Das Strafmaß wird zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt verkündet, Kelly droht erneut eine mehrere Jahrzehnte lange Haftstrafe. Kelly hatte die Vorwürfe stets zurückgewiesen. Er sitzt seit Sommer 2019 im Gefängnis. Zwei weitere angeklagte Ex-Angestellte Kellys wurden freigesprochen.
In Chicago ging es auch um ein verstörendes Video aus dem Jahr 2008
In Chicago ging es auch um ein bereits viele Jahre bekanntes Video, das Kelly zeigen soll, wie er ein 14-jähriges Mädchen missbraucht und auf sie uriniert. In diesem Fall war der Musiker 2008 von einer Jury bereits freigesprochen worden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft hatte ihm vorgeworfen, das Opfer unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit sie nicht in dem Prozess aussagt. In dem neuen Prozess hatte die mittlerweile volljährige Frau aber bestätigt, dass sie die Person in dem Video ist.
Das Verfahren ist - nach Fällen wie denen von Filmproduzent Harvey Weinstein und Komiker Bill Cosby - eine weitere viel beachtete juristische Aufarbeitung in der MeToo-Ära. Erste Anschuldigungen gegen den 1967 in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborenen Musiker wurden bereits vor rund 25 Jahren bekannt. Doch der Musik-Koloss schien unangreifbar auf seinem Pop-Thron und blieb lange Zeit auf freiem Fuß. Mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben, mehreren Grammys und anderen Auszeichnungen gehörte er zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern des späten 20. Jahrhunderts.
Aber spätestens als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation ""Surviving R. Kelly"" die Anschuldigungen zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer.

R. Kelly reconnu coupable de pédopornographie,"Pool / Getty Images Pool / Getty Images
ÉTATS -UNIS - R. Kelly, star déchue du R&B déjà condamnée à 30 ans de prison en juin pour des crimes sexuels commis sur des jeunes femmes parfois adolescentes, a été reconnu coupable de pédopornographie ce mercredi 14 septembre à Chicago.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 ans, a été condamné pour production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur.
Le chanteur, mondialement connu pour son tube I Believe I Can Fly et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, a en revanche été acquitté par un jury fédéral pour d’autres chefs d’inculpation d’obstruction à la justice.
Lui et deux anciens associés - également acquittés ce mercredi - étaient accusés d’avoir perturbé le cours de son procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, au cours duquel le jury l’avait déclaré non coupable.
Il leur était reproché d’avoir à la fois menacé et corrompu une victime, qui n’avait alors pas témoigné. Aujourd’hui âgée de 37 ans, elle s’est cette fois exprimée.
Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur des jeunes filles, dont l’une n’avait que 14 ans, ont été diffusés pendant le procès.
Le jury composé de 12 personnes a mis environ 11 heures pour parvenir à ce verdict, qui pourrait venir ajouter une lourde peine de prison aux 30 ans de réclusion auxquels R. Kelly a déjà été condamné.
Une peine « de dix à 90 ans de prison »
Sa peine, qui sera fixée ultérieurement, pourrait aller « de dix à 90 ans de prison », a précisé le bureau du procureur dans un communiqué.
Le verdict « oblige Robert Kelly à rendre des comptes pour les violences sexuelles commises sur une adolescente de 14 ans », a déclaré le procureur John Lausch.
« Les souffrances infligées par M. Kelly à ses victimes sont immenses », a-t-il ajouté, saluant la « force, la détermination et le courage » de celles qui ont témoigné lors du procès.
L’artiste avait déjà été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 à New York d’avoir piloté pendant trois décennies un « système » d’exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes.
Ce procès avait été considéré comme une étape majeure du mouvement #MeToo : c’était la première fois que la majorité des plaignantes étaient des femmes noires et qu’elles accusaient un artiste noir.
Pendant des décennies, le succès de R. Kelly avait été terni par des soupçons de violences sexuelles, objet de rumeurs persistantes. Il était longtemps parvenu à les faire taire avec des accords financiers prévoyant des clauses de confidentialité.
Dès 2017, deux femmes, Kenyette Barnes et Oronike Odeleye, avaient lancé un appel au boycott de ses chansons, en partageant le hashtag « Mute R. Kelly » (« Faites taire R. Kelly »).
Des victimes qui se faisaient « endoctriner » dans le milieu « sordide » de R. Kelly
En janvier 2019, la série documentaire Surviving R. Kelly avait enfoncé le clou. Plusieurs victimes y décrivaient le chanteur comme manipulateur, violent et obsédé par les très jeunes filles.
Lors du procès à New York, les victimes avaient décrit les tactiques utilisées par le chanteur pour attirer de très jeunes femmes en se servant de sa célébrité, et avec la complicité de son entourage.
Beaucoup d’entre elles avaient rencontré la star à des concerts, après lesquels on leur glissait un petit papier indiquant les coordonnées de R. Kelly.
Il ferait quelque chose pour leur carrière musicale, leur promettait-on.
Au lieu de cela, elles se faisaient « endoctriner » dans le milieu « sordide » de R. Kelly, étaient forcées à des rapports sexuels et maintenues dans ce « système » par des « mesures coercitives », selon l’accusation.
Le chanteur était parvenu à se hisser jusqu’au sommet de l’industrie musicale malgré sa vie personnelle tumultueuse, et notamment son mariage - ensuite annulé - avec sa protégée de 15 ans, la chanteuse Aaliyah.
R. Kelly avait écrit et produit le premier album de l’artiste décédée en 2001, Age Ain’t Nothin’ But A Number (L’âge n’est rien d’autre qu’un chiffre).

R. Kelly: Νέα καταδίκη του τραγουδιστή - Παρέσυρε ανήλικα κορίτσια για να έχουν σεξουαλικές επαφές μαζί του,"Ο αμερικανός τραγουδιστής της R&B, ο 55χρονος R. Kelly, κρίθηκε ένοχος ότι παρέσυρε ανήλικα κορίτσια για να έχουν σεξουαλικές επαφές μαζί του, αλλά αθωώθηκε για την κατηγορία της παρακώλυσης της δικαιοσύνης σε μια υπόθεση του 2008 η οποία κατέληξε στην αθώωσή του, όπως μεταδίδει το πρακτορείο Reuters επικαλούμενο αμερικανικά μέσα ενημέρωσης.
Σε αυτήν τη δίκη, ο R. Kelly – του οποίου το πλήρες όνομα είναι Ρόμπερτ Σιλβέστερ Κέλι – κρίθηκε ένοχος για έξι από τις δεκατρείς κατηγορίες που του είχε απαγγείλει ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο, σύμφωνα με το CBS Chicago.
Οι ένορκοι στο δικαστήριο του Σικάγο καταδίκασαν τον 55χρονο καλλιτέχνη για σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση ανηλίκων, αποπλάνηση και κατοχή υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας. Η ετυμηγορία του δικαστηρίου ανακοινώθηκε ύστερα από συνολικά 11 ώρες διαβουλεύσεων του σώματος των ενόρκων στη διάρκεια των τελευταίων δύο ημερών. Ο R. Kelly αντιμετωπίζει ποινή φυλάκισης τουλάχιστον 10 ετών.
Ο Κέλι είναι ένας από τους πιο διάσημους καλλιτέχνες που καταδικάστηκαν για αδικήματα σεξουαλικής φύσεως στη διάρκεια των αποκαλύψεων του κινήματος #MeToo ενάντια στη σεξουαλική παρενόχληση και κακοποίηση.
Κατά την ακροαματική διαδικασία που κράτησε πέντε εβδομάδες, αρκετές γυναίκες κατέθεσαν ως μάρτυρες και αφηγήθηκαν στους ενόρκους πώς ο Κέλι τις παρέσυρε και τις κακοποίησε σεξουαλικά όταν ήταν ανήλικες. Το σώμα των ενόρκων παρακολούθησε επίσης ένα βίντεο με τον Κέλι να παρενοχλεί σεξουαλικά τη βαφτιστήρα του, η οποία κατέθεσε πως η κακοποίησή της ξεκίνησε τη δεκαετία του 1990 όταν ήταν έφηβη, όπως μεταδίδει το Reuters και αναμεταδίδει το Αθηναϊκό Πρακτορείο Ειδήσεων. Ο Κέλι και οι άλλοι δύο συγκατηγορούμενοι, Μίλτον «June» Μπράουν και Ντέρελ Μακντέιβιντ, αθωώθηκαν για την κατηγορία της συνωμοσίας με στόχο την απόκτηση υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας. Ο Κέλι και ο Μακντέιβιντ αθωώθηκαν επίσης για την κατηγορία της συνωμοσίας με στόχο την παρακώλυση της δικαιοσύνης σε μια υπόθεση του 2002, σύμφωνα με την εφημερίδα Chicago Tribune.
Οι εναγόμενοι κατηγορούνταν επίσης για απόπειρα δωροδοκίας και εκβιασμού μαρτύρων σε μια υπόθεση του 2008 στο Ιλινόι, στην οποία ο Κέλι αθωώθηκε για κατηγορίες που αφορούσαν παιδική πορνογραφία.
Τον περασμένο Ιούνιο, ο R. Kelly καταδικάστηκε σε φυλάκιση 30 ετών αφότου ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο της Νέας Υόρκης τον έκρινε ένοχο για εκβιασμούς, σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση και εξώθηση στην πορνεία. Αυτή η δίκη ενίσχυσε τις κατηγορίες που βαρύνουν τον τραγουδιστή της βραβευμένης με Grammy επιτυχίας «I Believe I Can Fly» εδώ και δύο δεκαετίες.
Ο Κέλι αντιμετωπίζει επίσης κατηγορίες για ανάλογες υποθέσεις στο Ιλινόι και στη Μινεσότα.",2022-09-15T04:10:00Z,https://www.newsbeast.gr,Newsbeast.gr
"R. Kelly Convicted of Child Porn, Enticing Girls for Sex","CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury in Chicago convicted R. Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a monthlong trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to the Grammy Award winning singer who was once one of the world’s biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six of the 13 counts against him, with many of the convictions carrying long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count — that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid — who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly’s believability — were acquitted of all charges.
The trial was, in ways, a do-over of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both. Kelly, who shed tears of joy when jurors acquitted him in 2008, gave a thumbs-up sign to spectators after Wednesday’s verdict but otherwise showed little emotion.
Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar.
Asked by reporters later outside court how Kelly felt after the verdict, his lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said: “Mr. Kelly is used to bad news.”
“He’s still got many fights to fight,” she said. “But what he did say is that he had a sense of relief that this particular case was in the past now.”
The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.
And two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly — one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Chicago-based U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed satisfaction with the verdict. He told reporters that, when you add up the potential punishments on the six guilty counts, Kelly was staring at at least 10 years and up to 90 in prison.
Judge Harry Leinenweber did not set a sentencing date. He could order that Kelly serve whatever sentence he imposes simultaneously with the New York sentence or only after that one is fully served. The latter would, for practical purposes, mean a life sentence.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Some dozen Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Bonjean, Kelly’s attorney, told jurors in her closings that the government had relied, in some cases, on liars and and blackmailers as witnesses. She earlier implored jurors not to see Kelly as “the monster” she said prosecutors so badly wanted them to see.
In her closing rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
All four Kelly accusers who testified went by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, didn’t testify, and jurors acquitted Kelly of the one charge related to her.
Four of his six convictions were tied directly to Jane and relied largely on her testimony.
She was the government’s star witness and also pivotal to the trial fixing charge, of which he was acquitted, and which accused him of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial. Three of the child porn charges that Kelly was convicted of Wednesday were related to that video and others depicting Jane.
Jane, 37, said publicly for the first time at the just-ended trial that the girl in the video was her at age 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify.
Asked on the witness stand how many times Jane and Kelly had sexually abused her before she turned 18, Jane answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. Soon after that, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly recorded the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. She told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ’em. Period.”",2022-09-15T04:00:00Z,https://www.snopes.com,Snopes.com
"R. Kelly Found Guilty of Child Pornography, Other Charges in Sexual Abuse Trial","R&B singer R. Kelly was found guilty on Wednesday on multiple charges of child pornography and luring underage girls to have sex with him but not guilty of obstructing a 2008 state case that ended with his acquittal.
In his latest trial, Kelly – whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly – was found guilty by a jury on six out of 13 counts, prosecutors said.
He was found guilty of three child pornography counts and three counts of enticing minors for sex, but acquitted of seven other charges that included obstruction of justice, and conspiracy to receive child pornography.
In Chicago, a conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.
The verdict of the jury in U.S. District Court in Chicago came after jurors deliberated for 11 hours over two days.
Kelly is among the most prominent people convicted of sexual misbehavior during the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and abuse in recent years.
During the five-week trial, several women took the stand and told jurors that Kelly sexually abused them when they were minors. The jury also saw a video of Kelly molesting his goddaughter, who testified that the abuse began in the 1990s when she was a teenager.
Kelly and both his co-defendants, Milton “June” Brown and Derrel McDavid, were acquitted on charges they conspired to receive child pornography. Kelly and McDavid were also acquitted on charges they conspired to obstruct justice in an earlier case.
The men were accused of trying to bribe and threaten witnesses in the 2008 Illinois case in which Kelly was found not guilty on 14 counts of child pornography.
In June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on his conviction in a New York federal court on racketeering and prostitution charges. That trial amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the Grammy-winning hit “I Believe I Can Fly” for two decades.
Kelly also faces various state charges in Illinois and Minnesota.

R. Kelly convicted on child pornography charges in federal trial,"Singer R. Kelly is convicted of six counts of child pornography and enticement of a minor in Chicago federal trial. File photo by Jim Ruymen/UPI | License Photo
Sept. 14 (UPI) -- A federal jury in Chicago has convicted R&B singer R. Kelly on child pornography charges for videotaping himself sexually abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter and four other minors. Jurors deliberated for 11 hours and found Kelly guilty Wednesday on six out of 13 counts of sexual exploitation and enticement of a minor. Kelly was convicted on three of four counts of production of child pornography and three of five counts of enticement of a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity. Advertisement
The 55-year-old singer was acquitted of obstruction of justice related to an alleged conspiracy, with two associates, to hide video evidence during a trial in 2008. Both co-defendants, Milton Brown and Derrel McDavid, were acquitted on all charges against them.
This is the second guilty verdict for Kelly, who was convicted last year in New York on charges of federal racketeering and sex trafficking. He is currently serving a 30-year prison term in that case.

On Wednesday, U.S. Attorney John Lausch told reporters Kelly could face 10 to 90 years in prison for his latest convictions and that prosecutors will request both sentences be served consecutively.
""When we have instances where defendants are convicted of committing horrific acts against other individuals, and it's separate and apart from other horrific acts that he committed against other individuals, we're asking for that sentence to be consecutive,"" Lausch said.
Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was tried in Chicago in 2008 and was acquitted on 14 counts of producing child pornography. A video from that trial became a key piece of evidence in his new trial.
Five women, including Kelly's goddaughter ""Jane,"" accused Kelly of sexually abusing them when they were girls. While ""Jane"" denied that Kelly abused her in his 2008 child pornography trial, she identified herself as the person in the videotape and testified in this trial that Kelly intimidated her and her family and paid them off to keep the abuse secret.
During the trial, ""Jane"" testified that Kelly abused her ""innumerable"" times when she was a minor at his home, his recording studio, on tour buses and in hotel rooms. ""Jane"" also testified that she decided to come forward after she became ""exhausted with living with his lies.""

During closing arguments Monday, Assistant Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo reminded jurors, ""You have seen the tapes. You have seen what Kelly did to Jane.""
""Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years. He committed horrible crimes against children,"" Pozolo said. ""The hidden side of Robert Kelly has come to light. The truth has come out.""
In her closing argument Tuesday, Kelly's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, argued ""Jane's"" parents lied about and condoned Kelly's abuse.
""It is an inconvenient reality for the government,"" Bonjean said. ""Lives are complex, and for all the fist pounding and the outrage, that family made a decision that they had to live with at that time.""
Bonjean said she is considering filing an appeal, saying prosecutors had overblown their case during the five-week trial against Kelly.
""If this jury concluded that he was guilty on the first three counts, would they care enough to consider the evidence on the rest?"" Bonjean said outside the court following the verdict. ""And they demonstrated that they did. They did their job. They looked at each count separately.""",2022-09-15T02:33:41Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News

Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Chicago-based United States Attorney John Lausch expressed satisfaction with the verdict. He told reporters that, when one added up the potential punishments on the six guilty counts, Kelly was looking at least 10 years and up to 90 in prison.
Judge Harry Leinenweber did not set a sentencing date. He could order that Kelly serve whatever sentence he imposes simultaneously with the New York sentence or only after that one is fully served. The latter would, for practical purposes, mean a life sentence.
Master manipulator
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in starstuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Some dozen Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Bonjean told jurors in her closings that the government had relied, in some cases, on liars and blackmailers as witnesses. She earlier implored jurors not to see Kelly as ""the monster"" she said prosecutors so badly wanted them to see.
In her closing rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly's inner circle increasingly focused on doing what the ""I Believe I Can Fly"" singer wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
""And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,"" she said.
All four Kelly accusers who testified went by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse, but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, didn't testify, and jurors acquitted Kelly of the one charge related to her.
Four of his six convictions were tied directly to Jane and relied largely on her testimony.
She was the government's star witness and also pivotal to the trial fixing charge, of which he was acquitted, and which accused him of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of about 14, was the focal point of that trial. Three of the child porn charges that Kelly was convicted of Wednesday were related to that video and others depicting Jane.
Jane, 37, said publicly for the first time at the just-ended trial that the girl in the video was her at 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been about 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn't testify.
'Uncountable times'
Asked on the witness stand how many times Jane and Kelly had sexually abused her before she turned 18, Jane answered quietly: ""Uncountable times. ... Hundreds.""
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. Soon after that, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so spectators couldn't see the videos or the jurors' reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man ""daddy."" At one point she asks: ""Daddy, do you still love me?"" The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly recorded the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. She told jurors she still cared for Kelly. But as a 37-year-old mother, she said she now had a different perspective:
""If somebody did something to my kids,"" she said, ""I'm killing 'em. Period.""",2022-09-15T02:21:13Z,https://www.manilatimes.net,The Manila Times

R. Kelly, star déchue du R&B déjà condamnée à 30 ans de prison en juin pour des crimes sexuels commis sur des jeunes femmes parfois adolescentes, a été reconnu coupable de pédopornographie mercredi 14 septembre à Chicago.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 ans, a été condamné pour production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur.
Le chanteur, mondialement connu pour son tube ""I Believe I Can Fly"" et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, a en revanche été acquitté par un jury fédéral pour d'autres chefs d'inculpation d'obstruction à la justice.
Lui et deux anciens associés – également acquittés mercredi – étaient accusés d'avoir perturbé le cours de son procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, au cours duquel le jury l'avait déclaré non coupable. Il leur était reproché d'avoir à la fois menacé et corrompu une victime, qui n'avait alors pas témoigné. Aujourd'hui âgée de 37 ans, celle-ci s'est cette fois exprimée.
Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur des jeunes filles, dont l'une n'avait que 14 ans, ont été diffusés pendant le procès.
De 10 à 90 ans de prison
Le jury composé de 12 personnes a mis environ 11 heures pour parvenir à ce verdict, qui pourrait venir ajouter une lourde peine de prison aux 30 ans de réclusion auxquels R. Kelly a déjà été condamné. Sa peine, qui sera fixée ultérieurement, pourrait aller ""de dix à 90 ans de prison"", a précisé le bureau du procureur dans un communiqué.
Le verdict ""oblige Robert Kelly à rendre des comptes pour les violences sexuelles commises sur une adolescente de 14 ans"", a déclaré le procureur John Lausch. ""Les souffrances infligées par M. Kelly à ses victimes sont immenses"", a-t-il ajouté, saluant la ""force, la détermination et le courage"" de celles qui ont témoigné lors du procès.
L'artiste avait déjà été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 à New York d'avoir piloté pendant trois décennies un ""système"" d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes.
Ce procès avait été considéré comme une étape majeure du mouvement #MeToo : c'était la première fois que la majorité des plaignantes étaient des femmes noires et qu'elles accusaient un artiste noir.

"R. Kelly convicted on several child pornography charges, acquitted of trial fixing","R. Kelly convicted of six of 13 counts, but two associates are acquitted
R. Kelly convicted of six of 13 counts, but two associates are acquitted
R. Kelly convicted of six of 13 counts, but two associates are acquitted
A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography and sex abuse charges in his hometown of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement.
But the jury acquitted him on a fourth pornography count as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008. He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges.
Kelly's attorney said the mixed verdict showed government attorneys put on a case that was ""overcharged.""
""They charged counts that they couldn't win,"" said attorney Jennifer Bonjean, according to CBS Chicago.
But, she praised the jury for their careful deliberations.
""They did their job and looked at each count separately,"" Bonjean said. ""Obviously we are not celebrating a win, but are happy the jury looked at each count.""
The attorney told reporters that her team was considering an appeal but would not get into details of that strategy, CBS Chicago reported.
""He's still got many fights to fight,"" she said.
U.S. Attorney John Lausch said praised the verdict.
""Mr. Kelly engaged in sex acts with multiple girls under the age of 18 and he recorded some of those sex acts on video,"" Lausch said, according to CBS Chicago. ""We are pleased with the fact that Robert Kelly is being held accountable for that reprehensible conduct.""
Kelly's two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges.
Jurors wrote several questions to the judge on Wednesday, at least one indicating the panelists were grappling with some of the case's legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly's lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.
At trial, prosecutors sought to paint a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover child pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Kelly faced 13 counts. A conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum of five years. Judges can order that defendants sentenced earlier in separate cases serve their new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences.
During closing arguments Tuesday, Bonjean likened the government's testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, ""you don't just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,"" said told jurors.
""There are just too many cockroaches,"" she said of the prosecution's case.
The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days. Co-defendant McDavid, who was on the stand for three days, may have damaged Kelly's hopes for acquittal by saying that he now doubts Kelly was truthful when he denied abusing anyone after hearing the superstar's accusers testify.
In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly's inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
""And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,"" she said.
Four Kelly accusers testified, all referred to by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify.
Sitting nearby in a suit and face mask, Kelly often averted his eyes and looked down as his accusers spoke.
Some dozen die-hard Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Jane, 37, was the government's star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents wouldn't testify.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial.
On the witness stand for two days at the end of August, Jane paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue when she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her aged 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn't testify. At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane said she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video, saying part of her reason for lying was that she cared for Kelly and didn't want to get him into trouble.
Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: ""Uncountable times. … Hundreds.""
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly's Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 — the age of consent in Illinois — when Kelly began pursing her for sex.
Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution's portrayal of her client as ""a monster,"" saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray.
""Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,"" she said in her opening statement.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so journalists and spectators couldn't see the videos or the jurors' reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man ""daddy."" At one point she asks: ""Daddy, do you still love me?"" The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.

Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. At Kelly's Chicago home later that year, Pauline described her shock when she said she first walked in on Kelly and a naked Jane. She said Kelly told her that everyone has secrets. ""This is our secret,"" she testified he said.
Pauline told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.

ΗΠΑ: Νέα καταδίκη του τραγουδιστή R. Kelly για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση,"Ο Αμερικανός τραγουδιστής της R&B, ο 55χρονος R. Kelly, κρίθηκε ένοχος ότι παρέσυρε ανήλικα κορίτσια για να έχουν σεξουαλικές επαφές μαζί του, αλλά αθωώθηκε για την κατηγορία της παρακώλυσης της δικαιοσύνης σε μια υπόθεση του 2008 η οποία κατέληξε στην αθώωσή του, όπως μεταδίδει το πρακτορείο Reuters επικαλούμενο αμερικανικά μέσα ενημέρωσης.
Στη συγκεκριμένη δίκη, ο R. Kelly – του οποίου το πλήρες όνομα είναι Ρόμπερτ Σιλβέστερ Κέλι – κρίθηκε ένοχος για έξι από τις δεκατρείς κατηγορίες που του είχε απαγγείλει ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο, σύμφωνα με το CBS Chicago.
Οι ένορκοι στο δικαστήριο του Σικάγο καταδίκασαν τον 55χρονο καλλιτέχνη για σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση ανηλίκων, αποπλάνηση και κατοχή υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας. Η ετυμηγορία του δικαστηρίου ανακοινώθηκε ύστερα από συνολικά 11 ώρες διαβουλεύσεων του σώματος των ενόρκων στη διάρκεια των τελευταίων δύο ημερών. Ο R. Kelly αντιμετωπίζει ποινή φυλάκισης τουλάχιστον 10 ετών.
Ο Κέλι είναι ένας από τους πιο διάσημους καλλιτέχνες που καταδικάστηκαν για αδικήματα σεξουαλικής φύσεως στη διάρκεια των αποκαλύψεων του κινήματος #MeToo ενάντια στη σεξουαλική παρενόχληση και κακοποίηση.
Κατά την ακροαματική διαδικασία που κράτησε πέντε εβδομάδες, αρκετές γυναίκες κατέθεσαν ως μάρτυρες και αφηγήθηκαν στους ενόρκους πώς ο Κέλι τις παρέσυρε και τις κακοποίησε σεξουαλικά όταν ήταν ανήλικες. Το σώμα των ενόρκων παρακολούθησε επίσης ένα βίντεο με τον Κέλι να παρενοχλεί σεξουαλικά τη βαφτιστήρα του, η οποία κατέθεσε πως η κακοποίησή της ξεκίνησε τη δεκαετία του 1990 όταν ήταν έφηβη. Ο Κέλι και οι άλλοι δύο συγκατηγορούμενοι, Μίλτον «June» Μπράουν και Ντέρελ Μακντέιβιντ, αθωώθηκαν για την κατηγορία της συνωμοσίας με στόχο την απόκτηση υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας.

Οι εναγόμενοι κατηγορούνταν επίσης για απόπειρα δωροδοκίας και εκβιασμού μαρτύρων σε μια υπόθεση του 2008 στο Ιλινόι, στην οποία ο Κέλι αθωώθηκε για κατηγορίες που αφορούσαν παιδική πορνογραφία.

R. Kelly found guilty on multiple counts in sexual abuse trial,"The singer was, however, acquitted of seven other charges that included obstruction of justice, and conspiracy to receive child pornography
CHICAGO, USA – R&B singer R. Kelly was found guilty on Wednesday, September 14, on multiple charges of child pornography and luring underage girls to have sex with him but not guilty of obstructing a 2008 state case that ended with his acquittal.
In his latest trial, Kelly – whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly – was found guilty by a jury on six out of 13 counts, prosecutors said.
He was found guilty of three child pornography counts and three counts of enticing minors for sex, but acquitted of seven other charges that included obstruction of justice, and conspiracy to receive child pornography.
In Chicago, a conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.
The verdict of the jury in US District Court in Chicago came after jurors deliberated for 11 hours over two days.
Kelly is among the most prominent people convicted of sexual misbehavior during the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and abuse in recent years.
During the five-week trial, several women took the stand and told jurors that Kelly sexually abused them when they were minors. The jury also saw a video of Kelly molesting his goddaughter, who testified that the abuse began in the 1990s when she was a teenager.
Kelly and both his co-defendants, Milton “June” Brown and Derrel McDavid, were acquitted on charges they conspired to receive child pornography. Kelly and McDavid were also acquitted on charges they conspired to obstruct justice in an earlier case.
The men were accused of trying to bribe and threaten witnesses in the 2008 Illinois case in which Kelly was found not guilty on 14 counts of child pornography.
In June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on his conviction in a New York federal court on racketeering and prostitution charges. That trial amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the Grammy-winning hit “I Believe I Can Fly” for two decades.
Kelly also faces various state charges in Illinois and Minnesota. – Rappler.com",2022-09-15T00:33:41Z,https://www.rappler.com,Rappler

R. Kelly, star déchue du R&B déjà condamnée à 30 ans de prison en juin pour des crimes sexuels commis sur des jeunes femmes parfois adolescentes, a été reconnu coupable de pédopornographie mercredi à Chicago.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 ans, a été condamné pour production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur, selon le journal Chicago Tribune.
Le chanteur, mondialement connu pour son tube «I Believe I Can Fly» et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, a en revanche été acquitté par un jury fédéral pour d’autres chefs d’inculpation d’obstruction à la justice. Lui et deux anciens associés – également acquittés mercredi – étaient accusés d’avoir perturbé le cours de son procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, au cours duquel le jury l’avait déclaré non coupable.

Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur de jeunes adolescentes, dont l’une n’avait que 14 ans, ont été montrés pendant le procès.
Le jury composé de 12 personnes a mis environ 11 heures pour parvenir à ce verdict, qui pourrait venir ajouter une lourde peine de prison aux 30 ans de réclusion auxquels R. Kelly a déjà été condamné.
L’artiste avait été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 à New York d’avoir piloté pendant trois décennies un «système» d’exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes.
Système
Ce procès avait été considéré comme une étape majeure du mouvement #MeToo: c’était la première fois que la majorité des plaignantes étaient des femmes noires et qu’elles accusaient un artiste noir.
Pendant des décennies, le succès de R. Kelly avait été terni par des soupçons de violences sexuelles, objet de rumeurs persistantes. Il était longtemps parvenu à les faire taire avec des accords financiers prévoyant des clauses de confidentialité.
Dès 2017, deux femmes, Kenyette Barnes et Oronike Odeleye, avaient lancé un appel au boycott de ses chansons, en partageant le hashtag «Mute R. Kelly» («Faites taire R. Kelly»). En janvier 2019, la série documentaire «Surviving R. Kelly» avait enfoncé le clou. Plusieurs victimes y décrivaient le chanteur comme manipulateur, violent et obsédé par les très jeunes filles.
Lors du procès à New York, les victimes avaient décrit les tactiques utilisées par le chanteur pour attirer de très jeunes femmes en se servant de sa célébrité, et avec la complicité de son entourage.
Beaucoup d’entre elles avaient rencontré la star à des concerts, après lesquels on leur glissait un petit papier indiquant les coordonnées de R. Kelly. Il ferait quelque chose pour leur carrière musicale, leur promettait-on. Au lieu de cela, elles se faisaient «endoctriner» dans le milieu «sordide» de R. Kelly, étaient forcées à des rapports sexuels et maintenues dans ce «système» par des «mesures coercitives», selon l’accusation.
Le chanteur était parvenu à se hisser jusqu’au sommet de l’industrie musicale malgré sa vie personnelle tumultueuse, et notamment son mariage – ensuite annulé – avec sa protégée de 15 ans, la chanteuse Aaliyah. R. Kelly avait écrit et produit le premier album de l’artiste décédée en 2001, «Age Ain’t Nothin’ But A Number» («L’âge n’est rien d’autre qu’un chiffre»).",2022-09-15T00:32:58Z,https://www.lematin.ch,Le Matin

Darum gehts Im Juni war R. Kelly in New York wegen schwerer Sexualverbrechen zu 30 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt worden.
Nun drohen ihm viele weitere Jahre Gefängnis.
In Chicago wurde er wegen Kinderpornografie und der Verführung Minderjähriger schuldig gesprochen.
Der US-Musiker R. Kelly ist in einem weiteren Prozess wegen Kinderpornografie schuldig gesprochen worden. Ein Gericht in Chicago befand den früheren R&B-Star am Mittwoch der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie sowie der Verführung Minderjähriger schuldig, wie die Zeitung «Chicago Tribune» berichtete. Von sieben weiteren Anklagepunkten, darunter Behinderung der Justiz in einem vorangegangenen Verfahren, wurde Kelly demnach freigesprochen.
Kelly und zwei frühere Mitarbeiter war vorgeworfen worden, einen Kinderpornografie-Prozess gegen den Musiker im Jahr 2008 manipuliert zu haben. Auch die Ex-Mitarbeiter wurden von diesen Vorwürfen freigesprochen.
Netzwerk von Helfern aufgebaut
Im Juni war der mit dem Hit «I Believe I Can Fly» zum Star gewordene Kelly in New York wegen schwerer Sexualverbrechen zu 30 Jahren Gefängnis verurteilt worden. Laut Anklage hatte Kelly ein ganzes Netzwerk von Helfern aufgebaut, um junge Mädchen und Frauen zur Befriedigung seiner sexuellen Gelüste zu rekrutieren. Seine Opfer soll er teils eingesperrt und brutal missbraucht haben.
Gegen den Sänger waren bereits vor rund 25 Jahren erste Vorwürfe laut geworden. Für Aufsehen sorgte ausserdem Kellys später annullierte Ehe mit der damals erst 15 Jahre alten Sängerin Aaliyah.

"El cantante R. Kelly recibe una nueva condena, por pornografía infantil","Un jurado federal de Chicago ha condenado este miércoles al ídolo caído del R&B R. Kelly por seis de los 12 delitos de los que se le acusaba: tres de pornografía infantil y tres de pedofilia. Sus 12 miembros encontraron probado, tras una deliberación de 11 horas, repartida en dos días, que se grabó abusando sexualmente de una muchacha, que entonces, a finales de los noventa, contaba 14 años. Durante el juicio, la identidad de la víctima, hoy una mujer de 37 años, se mantuvo tras el alias, habitual en el derecho procesal estadounidense, de Jane. Al músico le queda ahora conocer la sentencia; cada uno de esos delitos acarrea en el Estado de Illinois penas de prisión de hasta 10 años.
En junio pasado, un juez de Nueva York lo condenó a 30 años de cárcel por nueve cargos por abusos y tráfico sexual, nueve meses después de que un tribunal lo hallase culpable en un juicio enormemente mediático en el que se escucharon durante semanas los testimonios de 45 de sus víctimas, que lo pintaron como a un hombre poderoso que se servía de su fama para, con la ayuda de sus colaboradores, tejer una red de abusos, a menudo cometidos con menores. Entonces lo acusaban siete hombres y dos mujeres. Aquella victoria judicial se interpretó en Estados Unidos como un hito racial en el movimiento Me Too.
Este miércoles, Robert Sylvester Kelly, de 55 años, fue también absuelto de conspirar para obstruir a la justicia en un proceso emprendido contra él en 2002, también en Chicago, en cuya zona sur creció y desarrolló su carrera, así como de un complot para conseguir pornografía infantil. Vestido con un traje azul marino y tras unas gafas negras, el cantante ha escuchado impertérrito el veredicto. En el banquillo de los acusados también se sentaban dos de sus colaboradores, Derrel McDavid y Milton Brown, a los que el jurado declaró inocentes.
Los hechos por los que se le ha condenado a Kelly este miércoles ya fueron objeto de un juicio, después de que en 2002 el video llegó a ojos de un periodista musical de Chicago, Jim DeRogatis. Entonces, la víctima mintió al gran jurado que instruía el caso, al que aseguró que ella no era la niña que salía en el video, y que nunca había mantenido relaciones sexuales con Kelly. Tampoco se presentó al juicio, lo que posibilitó que en 2008 el músico fuera declarado inocente. En realidad, Jane tuvo una relación de varios años con el artista, y no se decidió a hablar hasta que una serie documental titulada Surviving R. Kelly (2019), producida por la cineasta negra Dream Hampton, que daba la voz a varias de las mujeres que lo acusaban desde hace años, reavivó el caso contra el músico.
Según la acusación, el primer silencio de Jane se debió a una conspiración criminal de Kelly y sus secuaces para convencerla a ella y a otras chicas a las que grabaron entonces de no cooperar con la justicia. Según varios testigos, el cantante trató desesperadamente de recuperar esas grabaciones porno con menores, que en la época sacaba del interior de una bolsa de gimnasia para distribuirlas por la ciudad. En el segundo proceso, que arrancó el pasado mes de agosto, la fiscalía afirmó que llegó a ofrecer hasta un millón de dólares por recobrar esas pruebas de sus crímenes.
Las primeras sospechas de Kelly provienen de los 90, sus años de mayor gloria, cuando era una superestrella del R&B, estilo musical de consumo esencialmente estadounidense que actualizó el soul en la última década del siglo. Su mayor éxito en Europa fue, en 1996, I Believe I Can Fly. En ese tiempo, y pese a su fama, era habitual verlo en un McDonald’s de Chicago al que iba, recuerdan los testigos, a la caza de estudiantes de un instituto cercano.
Jane era una de esas muchachas. Militaba en un grupo vocal junto a otras adolescentes. Conoció a Kelly cuando estudiaba en el instituto. Visitó su estudio de grabación con una tía, cantante profesional. Poco después de esa reunión, Jane les dijo a sus padres que Kelly sería su padrino. Cuando estos supieron de la existencia del video, Kelly se arrodilló ante ellos y les suplicó que lo perdonaran, según el testimonio de la hija. Esta les imploró que no tomaran medidas contra el músico porque “lo amaba”.

"R. Kelly convicted on multiple counts of child pornography, acquitted of fixing 2008 trial","A federal jury in Chicago convicted R. Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a month-long trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to a singer who was once one of the world's biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six counts against him, with many of which carry long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count — that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid — who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly's believability — were acquitted of all charges.
The trial was, in ways, a do-over of the 2008 trial, with a key video critical to both. Kelly, who shed tears of joy when jurors acquitted him in 2008, gave a thumbs-up sign to spectators after Wednesday's verdict but otherwise showed little emotion. Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged the Grammy Award-winning singer, who rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side to become a superstar.
The verdict comes after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won't be eligible for release until he is around 80.
2 more trials to come
Two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly — one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse and then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million US to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant and a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years. A judge could order Kelly to serve a new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85 per cent of their sentences.
During closing arguments, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government's testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, ""you don't just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,"" Bonjean told jurors.
""There are just too many cockroaches,"" she said of the prosecution's case.
The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days, including McDavid.
In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly's inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
""And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,"" she said.
Four Kelly accusers testified. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser did not testify.",2022-09-14T23:58:49Z,https://www.cbc.ca,CBC.ca
Sex mit Minderjährigen: R. Kelly erneut schuldig gesprochen,"Trotz zahlreicher kursierender Geschichten über Sex mit Minderjährigen schien es jahrzehntelang so, als sei R. Kelly unangreifbar. Doch die Vergangenheit holte ihn schließlich ein.
Ex-Popstar R. Kelly ist erneut wegen Sexualstraftaten verurteilt worden. Eine Jury in Chicago befand den 55-Jährigen am Mittwoch schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben, wie US-Medien am Mittwoch übereinstimmend berichteten.
Erst vor einigen Wochen war der I believe I can fly-Sänger in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen des Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt worden. In einem zweiten Prozess in Chicago war er in 13 Punkten angeklagt, unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen und der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen.
Laut New York Times sprachen die zwölf Geschworenen ihn in 7 Punkten frei - unter anderem vom Vorwurf der Behinderung der Justiz. Das Strafmaß wird zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt verkündet, Kelly droht erneut eine mehrere Jahrzehnte lange Haftstrafe. Kelly hatte die Vorwürfe stets zurückgewiesen. Er sitzt seit Sommer 2019 im Gefängnis. Zwei weitere angeklagte Ex-Angestellte Kellys wurden freigesprochen.
In Chicago ging es auch um ein bereits viele Jahre bekanntes Video, das Kelly zeigen soll, wie er ein 14-jähriges Mädchen missbraucht und auf sie uriniert. In diesem Fall war der Musiker 2008 von einer Jury bereits freigesprochen worden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft hatte ihm vorgeworfen, das Opfer unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit sie nicht in dem Prozess aussagt. In dem neuen Prozess hatte die mittlerweile volljährige Frau aber bestätigt, dass sie die Person in dem Video ist.
Das Verfahren ist - nach Fällen wie denen von Filmproduzent Harvey Weinstein und Komiker Bill Cosby - eine weitere viel beachtete juristische Aufarbeitung in der MeToo-Ära. Erste Anschuldigungen gegen den 1967 in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborenen Musiker wurden bereits vor rund 25 Jahren bekannt. Doch der Musik-Koloss schien unangreifbar auf seinem Pop-Thron und blieb lange Zeit auf freiem Fuß. Mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben, mehreren Grammys und anderen Auszeichnungen gehörte er zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern des späten 20. Jahrhunderts.
Aber spätestens als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation Surviving R. Kelly die Anschuldigungen zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer. Stars distanzierten sich von ihm, zudem Radiosender, Streaming-Dienste und dann auch sein Musiklabel RCA, das zu Sony Music gehört.",2022-09-14T23:55:26Z,https://www.rtl.de,RTL Online
"R. Kelly Found Guilty Of Child Pornography, Enticing Minors In Chicago","Grammy-winning singer R. Kelly was found guilty in Chicago today on six of 13 counts related to child pornography and luring underage girls to have sex with him, according to Reuters. Each child pornography conviction carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in Chicago.
Previously, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison at a Brooklyn federal court on nine counts of sex trafficking and racketeering.
Today Kelly was found guilty of three child pornography counts and three counts of enticing minors for sex. He was acquitted of seven other charges, including obstruction of justice and conspiracy to receive child pornography. He had pled not guilty.
Of the felony counts of sexual assault, four of them are aggravated criminal sexual assault that carry a maximum sentence of up to 30 years in prison.
The charges were originally filed May 30, 2019 after Kelly previously pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse against four alleged victims — three of whom prosecutors say were underage at the time. The new charges are related to one of the original underage victims and allegedly occurred in 2010.
The Associated Press said prosecutors wrote in court documents that because the victim was underage at the time, the statute of limitations for bringing charges extended to 20 years from her 18th birthday.
Kelly also faces additional charges in Illinois and Minnesota, according to Reuters.
The latest news is part of the fallout from Lifetime’s 2019 documentary series Surviving R. Kelly, which featured alleged victims coming forward to detail the singer’s abusive past. After that, Stormy Daniels’ ex-lawyer Michael Avenatti came forward with a video allegedly showing Kelly involved in sex acts with a 14-year-old girl.",2022-09-14T23:46:17Z,https://deadline.com,Deadline
Le chanteur R. Kelly reconnu coupable de pédopornographie,"R. Kelly a été reconnu coupable de pédopornographie mercredi à Chicago. La star déchue du R&B a déjà été condamnée à 30 ans de prison en juin pour des crimes sexuels commis sur des jeunes femmes parfois adolescentes.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 ans, a été condamné pour production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur, selon le journal Chicago Tribune. Le chanteur, mondialement connu pour son tube ""I Believe I Can Fly"" et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, a en revanche été acquitté par un jury fédéral pour d'autres chefs d'inculpation d'obstruction à la justice.
Lui et deux anciens associés - également acquittés mercredi - étaient accusés d'avoir perturbé le cours de son procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, au cours duquel le jury l'avait déclaré non coupable. Il leur était reproché d'avoir à la fois menacé et corrompu une victime, qui n'avait alors pas témoigné. Aujourd'hui âgée de 37 ans, elle s'est cette fois exprimée.
Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur de jeunes adolescentes, dont l'une n'avait que 14 ans, ont été montrées pendant le procès. Le jury composé de 12 personnes a mis environ 11 heures pour parvenir à ce verdict, qui pourrait venir ajouter une lourde peine de prison aux 30 ans de réclusion auxquels R. Kelly a déjà été condamné.
L'artiste avait été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 à New York d'avoir piloté pendant trois décennies un ""système"" d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes.
Obsédé par les très jeunes filles
Ce procès avait été considéré comme une étape majeure du mouvement #MeToo: c'était la première fois que la majorité des plaignantes étaient des femmes noires et qu'elles accusaient un artiste noir.
Pendant des décennies, le succès de R. Kelly avait été terni par des soupçons de violences sexuelles, objet de rumeurs persistantes. Il était longtemps parvenu à les faire taire avec des accords financiers prévoyant des clauses de confidentialité.
Dès 2017, deux femmes, Kenyette Barnes et Oronike Odeleye, avaient lancé un appel au boycott de ses chansons, en partageant le hashtag ""Mute R. Kelly"" (""Faites taire R. Kelly""). En janvier 2019, la série documentaire ""Surviving R. Kelly"" avait enfoncé le clou. Plusieurs victimes y décrivaient le chanteur comme manipulateur, violent et obsédé par les très jeunes filles.
Système
Lors du procès à New York, les victimes avaient décrit les tactiques utilisées par le chanteur pour attirer de très jeunes femmes en se servant de sa célébrité, et avec la complicité de son entourage. Beaucoup d'entre elles avaient rencontré la star à des concerts, après lesquels on leur glissait un petit papier indiquant les coordonnées de R. Kelly.
Il ferait quelque chose pour leur carrière musicale, leur promettait-on. Au lieu de cela, elles se faisaient ""endoctriner"" dans le milieu ""sordide"" de R. Kelly, étaient forcées à des rapports sexuels et maintenues dans ce ""système"" par des ""mesures coercitives"", selon l'accusation.
Le chanteur était parvenu à se hisser jusqu'au sommet de l'industrie musicale malgré sa vie personnelle tumultueuse, et notamment son mariage - ensuite annulé - avec sa protégée de 15 ans, la chanteuse Aaliyah. R. Kelly avait écrit et produit le premier album de l'artiste décédée en 2001, ""Age Ain't Nothin' But A Number"" (""L'âge n'est rien d'autre qu'un chiffre"").

R. Kelly Convicted in Sex Abuse Case Involving Videos of a Teenage Girl,"CHICAGO — R. Kelly, the fallen R&B star once revered as a product of this city’s South Side, was convicted Wednesday of child sex crimes as a jury found that he had produced three videos of himself sexually abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter.
Mr. Kelly, 55, is already serving a 30-year prison sentence after a jury in Brooklyn convicted him of racketeering and sex trafficking charges last year — the first time Mr. Kelly had been held criminally responsible for sexual abuse despite accusations dating back more than three decades. The conviction in Chicago could add years to that prison sentence.
The 12-person jury in the trial here convicted Mr. Kelly of six of the 13 charges brought against him, including three counts of coercing minors into sexual activity and three of producing sex tapes involving a minor. But in something of a setback to prosecutors, he was acquitted of a charge that he had attempted to obstruct an earlier investigation into his abuse of the underage girl, and two other counts of enticing minors to have sex.",2022-09-14T23:41:46Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
"R. Kelly convicted on many child porn counts, acquitted of trial fixing","By MICHAEL TARM and JOEY CAPPELLETTI
CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury in Chicago convicted R. Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a monthlong trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to a singer who was once one of the world’s biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six of the 13 counts against him, with many of the convictions carrying long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count — that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrell McDavid — who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly’s believability — were acquitted of all charges.

Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged the Grammy Award-winning singer, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar.
The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.
Two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly — one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant and a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Just one count of producing child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years. A judge could order Kelly to serve a new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences.
During closing arguments, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors.
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said of the prosecution’s case.
The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days, including McDavid.
In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
All four Kelly accusers who testified went by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify.
Some dozen Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Jane, 37, was the government’s star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents wouldn’t testify.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial.
Jane said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her at age 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify.
At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 — the age of consent in Illinois — when Kelly began pursuing her.
Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster,” saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly recorded the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. She told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ’em. Period.”

Νέα καταδίκη του τραγουδιστή R. Kelly για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση ανηλίκων,"Ο Αμερικανός τραγουδιστής της R&B, ο 55χρονος R. Kelly, κρίθηκε ένοχος ότι παρέσυρε ανήλικα κορίτσια για να έχουν σεξουαλικές επαφές μαζί του, αλλά αθωώθηκε για την κατηγορία της παρακώλυσης της δικαιοσύνης σε μια υπόθεση του 2008 η οποία κατέληξε στην αθώωσή του, όπως μεταδίδει το πρακτορείο Reuters επικαλούμενο αμερικανικά μέσα ενημέρωσης.

Οι ένορκοι στο δικαστήριο του Σικάγο καταδίκασαν τον 55χρονο καλλιτέχνη για σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση ανηλίκων, αποπλάνηση και κατοχή υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας. Η ετυμηγορία του δικαστηρίου ανακοινώθηκε ύστερα από συνολικά 11 ώρες διαβουλεύσεων του σώματος των ενόρκων στη διάρκεια των τελευταίων δύο ημερών. Ο R. Kelly αντιμετωπίζει ποινή φυλάκισης τουλάχιστον 10 ετών.

Κατά την ακροαματική διαδικασία που κράτησε πέντε εβδομάδες, αρκετές γυναίκες κατέθεσαν ως μάρτυρες και αφηγήθηκαν στους ενόρκους πώς ο Κέλι τις παρέσυρε και τις κακοποίησε σεξουαλικά όταν ήταν ανήλικες. Το σώμα των ενόρκων παρακολούθησε επίσης ένα βίντεο με τον Κέλι να παρενοχλεί σεξουαλικά τη βαφτιστήρα του, η οποία κατέθεσε πως η κακοποίησή της ξεκίνησε τη δεκαετία του 1990 όταν ήταν έφηβη. Ο Κέλι και οι άλλοι δύο συγκατηγορούμενοι, Μίλτον «June» Μπράουν και Ντέρελ Μακντέιβιντ, αθωώθηκαν για την κατηγορία της συνωμοσίας με στόχο την απόκτηση υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας. Ο Κέλι και ο Μακντέιβιντ αθωώθηκαν επίσης για την κατηγορία της συνωμοσίας με στόχο την παρακώλυση της δικαιοσύνης σε μια υπόθεση του 2002, σύμφωνα με την εφημερίδα Chicago Tribune.

R. Kelly considerado culpado de crimes de pornografia infantil,"O cantor R. Kelly, de 55 anos, foi esta quarta-feira considerado culpado de três crimes de pornografia infantil e de três acusações de incitamento de menores, por um júri federal, no estado norte-americano de Chicago. Após 11 horas de deliberação, R. Kelly foi, no entanto, ilibado de sete acusações, incluindo obstrução de justiça referente a um processo de pornografia infantil de 2008.
Conhecido pelo sucesso ""I believe I can fly"", o cantor foi acusado de incitar cinco raparigas para atividade sexual e de conspirar com dois ex-associados para encobrir os seus crimes sexuais, de acordo com a CBS Chicago.
Os outros arguidos deste processo, Derrell McDavid e Milton ""June"" Brown foram absolvidos de todas as acusações.

O júri absolveu R. Kelly de uma acusação de pornografia, bem como uma acusação de conspiração para obstruir a justiça. Foi considerado inocente em todas as três acusações de conspiração para receber pornografia infantil e por duas incriminações de aliciamento.
No julgamento, os procuradores tentaram retratar o cantor como um mestre manipulador que usou a sua fama e riqueza para atrair fãs, incluindo alguns menores de idade, abusando sexualmente deles e depois descartá-los.
De acordo com testemunhas, o artista estava desesperado para recuperar os vídeos pornográficos infantis que produzia e guardava numa mochila de ginástica.
Testemunhas indicaram que R. Kelly ofereceu até um milhão de dólares (cerca de um milhão de euros) para recuperar vídeos perdidos antes do seu julgamento de 2008, sabendo que o colocariam em perigo.
A conspiração para esconder os seus abusos ocorreu entre 2000 e 2020, atentaram os procuradores.
Em Chicago, uma condenação de apenas uma acusação de pornografia infantil acarreta uma sentença mínima obrigatória de 10 anos, enquanto a receção de pornografia infantil determina um mínimo obrigatório de cinco anos.
Em junho deste ano, R. Kelly foi condenado a 30 anos de prisão por extorsão e tráfico sexual. O tribunal federal do Brooklyn considerou que o cantor recrutou adolescentes e mulheres, forçando-as a atividades sexuais, uma prática que se estendeu ao longo de décadas. Na altura foi ainda condenado a pagar uma multa de 100 mil dólares.
A condenação de Kelly em Nova Iorque foi amplamente vista como um marco para o movimento #MeToo: foi o primeiro grande julgamento por abuso sexual em que a maioria dos acusadores eram mulheres negras.
Em setembro de 2021, Robert Sylvester Kelly, outrora uma das estrelas de R&B, foi considerado culpado de todas as nove acusações que enfrentou, incluindo a mais grave de extorsão. ""As suas ações foram descaradas, manipuladoras, controladoras e coercivas. Ele não demonstrou nenhum arrependimento ou respeito pela lei"", escreveram os promotores, no seu memorando de sentença.
R. Kelly aguarda ainda um julgamento em Minnesota e outro em Chicago, relacionados com casos de agressão e abuso sexual.

ΗΠΑ: Νέα καταδίκη του τραγουδιστή R. Kelly για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση ανηλίκων,"Ο αμερικανός τραγουδιστής της R&B, ο 55χρονος R. Kelly (φωτογραφία αρχείου, επάνω, από E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune via AP), κρίθηκε ένοχος ότι παρέσυρε ανήλικα κορίτσια για να έχουν σεξουαλικές επαφές μαζί του, αλλά αθωώθηκε για την κατηγορία της παρακώλυσης της δικαιοσύνης σε μια υπόθεση του 2008 η οποία κατέληξε στην αθώωσή του, όπως μεταδίδει το πρακτορείο Reuters επικαλούμενο αμερικανικά μέσα ενημέρωσης.
Τουλάχιστον 10 χρόνια φυλάκιση
Σε αυτήν τη δίκη, ο R. Kelly – του οποίου το πλήρες όνομα είναι Ρόμπερτ Σιλβέστερ Κέλι – κρίθηκε ένοχος για έξι από τις δεκατρείς κατηγορίες που του είχε απαγγείλει ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο, σύμφωνα με το CBS Chicago.

Οι ένορκοι στο δικαστήριο του Σικάγο καταδίκασαν τον 55χρονο καλλιτέχνη για σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση ανηλίκων, αποπλάνηση και κατοχή υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας.
Η ετυμηγορία του δικαστηρίου ανακοινώθηκε ύστερα από συνολικά 11 ώρες διαβουλεύσεων του σώματος των ενόρκων στη διάρκεια των τελευταίων δύο ημερών. Ο R. Kelly αντιμετωπίζει ποινή φυλάκισης τουλάχιστον 10 ετών.
Ο Κέλι είναι ένας από τους πιο διάσημους καλλιτέχνες που καταδικάστηκαν για αδικήματα σεξουαλικής φύσεως στη διάρκεια των αποκαλύψεων του κινήματος #MeToo ενάντια στη σεξουαλική παρενόχληση και κακοποίηση.
Κατά την ακροαματική διαδικασία που κράτησε πέντε εβδομάδες, αρκετές γυναίκες κατέθεσαν ως μάρτυρες και αφηγήθηκαν στους ενόρκους πώς ο Κέλι τις παρέσυρε και τις κακοποίησε σεξουαλικά όταν ήταν ανήλικες.
Και άλλα 30 χρόνια από άλλη υπόθεση
Το σώμα των ενόρκων παρακολούθησε επίσης ένα βίντεο με τον Κέλι να παρενοχλεί σεξουαλικά τη βαφτιστήρα του, η οποία κατέθεσε πως η κακοποίησή της ξεκίνησε τη δεκαετία του 1990 όταν ήταν έφηβη.
Ο Κέλι και οι άλλοι δύο συγκατηγορούμενοι, Μίλτον «June» Μπράουν και Ντέρελ Μακντέιβιντ, αθωώθηκαν για την κατηγορία της συνωμοσίας με στόχο την απόκτηση υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας.
Ο Κέλι και ο Μακντέιβιντ αθωώθηκαν επίσης για την κατηγορία της συνωμοσίας με στόχο την παρακώλυση της δικαιοσύνης σε μια υπόθεση του 2002, σύμφωνα με την εφημερίδα Chicago Tribune.
Οι εναγόμενοι κατηγορούνταν επίσης για απόπειρα δωροδοκίας και εκβιασμού μαρτύρων σε μια υπόθεση του 2008 στο Ιλινόι, στην οποία ο Κέλι αθωώθηκε για κατηγορίες που αφορούσαν παιδική πορνογραφία.

Αυτή η δίκη ενίσχυσε τις κατηγορίες που βαρύνουν τον τραγουδιστή της βραβευμένης με Grammy επιτυχίας «I Believe I Can Fly» εδώ και δύο δεκαετίες.

Disgraced R &B superstar R. Kelly was found guilty Wednesday on sex crime charges, including producing child pornography and enticing minors to engage in sexual activity, in his second federal trial.
Kelly, 55, faced multiple child pornography, sex abuse and obstruction charges involving an earlier investigation that ended with his acquittal in a 2008 state child pornography trial in his hometown of Chicago.
A jury in the same city found Kelly guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of enticing a minor. He was acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him of fixing the 2008 trial.
""The evidence in this case revealed reprehensible conduct,"" U.S. Attorney John Lausch said.
Kelly faces 10 to 90 years in prison.
He is already serving a 30-year prison sentence after he was convicted in a New York federal court last year of racketeering and violating the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law, including having sex with underage girls.
Two further trials are pending for Kelly -- one in Minnesota and another in state court in Chicago.

R. Kelly opnieuw schuldig bevonden aan seksuele misdrijven,"CHICAGO (ANP) - R. Kelly, die al een celstraf van dertig jaar uitzit, is woensdag in Chicago opnieuw schuldig bevonden aan seksuele misdrijven, waaronder ook het produceren van kinderporno. Volgens CBS Chicago werd de Amerikaanse zanger door een jury schuldig bevonden aan zes van de dertien aanklachten. Wat dit betekent voor zijn decennialange gevangenisstraf en wanneer de uitspraak van de rechter over de hoogte van zijn straf volgt, is niet duidelijk.
In de staat Illinois wordt R. Kelly, die eigenlijk Robert Sylvester Kelly heet, verdacht van dertien aanklachten. Naast het produceren en verspreiden van kinderporno en het verleiden van minderjarigen tot seks, staat hij er ook terecht voor het belemmeren van de rechtsgang. De zanger komt zelf uit Chicago.
De zanger wordt al sinds de jaren negentig beschuldigd van seksueel misbruik. In 2008 werd hij in een zaak die tegen hem liep, niet schuldig bevonden. Het vermoeden was dat Kelly dat proces zou hebben gemanipuleerd, maar volgens de jury is hier geen sprake van.
R. Kelly is een van de meest prominente Amerikanen die veroordeeld is na de opkomst van #MeToo. Hij kreeg eind juni in New York een celstraf van dertig jaar voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken.",2022-09-14T22:58:39Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen

In seiner Heimatstadt Chicago war er nun unter anderem auch angeklagt, in einem früheren Prozess gegen ihn im Jahr 2008 eine Zeugin unter Druck gesetzt und bestochen zu haben, um so einer Verurteilung zu entgehen. In diesem Punkt gab es einen Freispruch, ebenso wie beim Vorwurf der Behinderung der Justiz.

R. Kelly erneut vor Gericht: Kinder missbraucht! Ex-Pop-Star verurteilt,"R. Kelly sitzt bereits wegen einer Verurteilung im Gefängnis, jetzt kommen wohl noch einige Jahre dazu (Archivfoto)
Von: René Garzke
Jetzt wird seine Zeit im Knast wohl NOCH länger ausfallen!
Ex-Pop-Star R. Kelly (55) ist erneut wegen Sexualstraftaten verurteilt worden.
Eine Jury in Chicago befand den früheren Musiker („I Believe I Can Fly“) am Mittwoch schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben. Das berichteten am Mittwochabend übereinstimmend mehrere US-Medien.
Erst vor einigen Wochen war Kelly in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen des Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt worden.
In einem zweiten Prozess in Chicago war er in 13 Punkten angeklagt: Unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen und der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen.
Staatsanwältin Jeannice Appenteng in ihrem Schluss-Plädoyer: „Meine Damen und Herren, was R. Kelly wollte, war, Sex mit jungen Mädchen zu haben.“
Vier Frauen sagten vor Gericht gegen den Ex-Musiker aus, alle nur mit Pseudonymen oder ohne dass ihre Nachnamen fielen.
Im Zentrum des Prozesses stand ein Video, das laut Staatsanwaltschaft zeigt, wie Kelly ein etwa 14 Jahre altes Mädchen missbraucht und auf sie uriniert.
Als der Jury im Zuge des Prozesses das Missbrauchsvideo gezeigt wurde, wurden im Gerichtssaal schwarze Trennwände aufgestellt, um die verletzenden Bilder so wenigen Menschen wie möglich zu zeigen
In diesem Fall war der Musiker 2008 von einer Jury bereits freigesprochen worden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft hatte ihm damals vorgeworfen, das Opfer unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit sie nicht in dem Prozess aussagt.
Hunderte Male missbraucht
In dem neuen Prozess hatte die mittlerweile volljährige Frau mit Tränen in den Augen dann aber bestätigt, dass sie die Person in dem Video ist. Kelly sei bei der Tat rund 30 Jahre alt gewesen.
Sie sagte den Geschworenen, sie sei 15 gewesen, als sie zum ersten Mal Geschlechtsverkehr hatten. Auf die Frage, wie oft sie missbraucht wurde, bevor sie 18 wurde, antwortete sie leise: „Unzählige Male. Hunderte.“
Eine damalige Klassenkameradin der Frau sagte aus, ihre Freundin habe sie mit zu Kellys Haus genommen. Dort der Schock: Sie sah den Musiker und ihre Freundin nackt. Kelly habe ihr gesagt, dass jeder Mensch Geheimnisse habe. „Dies ist unser Geheimnis“, sagte er demnach.
Laut „New York Times“ sprachen die zwölf Geschworenen ihn in sieben der 13 Punkte frei – unter anderem vom Vorwurf der Behinderung der Justiz.

Een jury in de rechtszaak tegen R. Kelly in Chicago heeft de zanger schuldig bevonden aan verschillende kinderporno-aanklachten. Hij werd vrijgesproken van het belemmeren van de rechtsgang.
Robert Sylvester Kelly (55) wordt al sinds de jaren 90 beschuldigd van (kinder)misbruik en zit sinds 2019 vast. In juni werd hij in New York al veroordeeld voor het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken. Hij kreeg daarvoor 30 jaar celstraf opgelegd. De nieuwe straf die de federale rechter in de zaak in Chicago na het oordeel van de jury zal opleggen komt daar bovenop.
In Chicago stond Kelly terecht voor 13 vergrijpen waaronder het produceren van kinderporno, het verleiden van minderjarigen tot seks en het belemmeren van de rechtsgang in een eerdere rechtszaak in 2008. Aan zes van die aanklachten is hij nu schuldig bevonden.

Bij een eerdere rechtszaak in 2008 wilde het slachtoffer niet getuigen en Kelly werd toen vrijgesproken, Ze is inmiddels 37 jaar oud en wilde nu wel een getuigenis afleggen. Ze bevestigde dat ze het meisje in de video was. Ze vertelde dat de verdachte haar honderden keren had misbruikt voordat ze 18 jaar was.

Kelly scoorde in de jaren 90 grote hits zoals I believe I can fly. Hij verkocht miljoenen albums, zelfs nadat de geruchten over misbruik begonnen te circuleren.

R Kelly, the fallen R&B star who was once revered as a product of Chicago’s South Side, was found guilty on Wednesday of sex crimes, including producing child sexual abuse imagery and coercing minors into sex acts.
Kelly, 55, had already been sentenced to 30 years in prison after a jury in New York convicted him of racketeering and sex trafficking charges last year — the first time Kelly had been held criminally responsible for allegations related to sexual abuse despite accusations dating back more than three decades. The conviction in Chicago could add years to that prison sentence.
On Wednesday, the 12-person jury in the trial convicted Kelly of six out of the 13 charges brought against him. He was found guilty of coercing three minors into criminal sexual activity and producing three child sexual abuse videos. Kelly was acquitted of attempting to obstruct an earlier investigation into his abuse.
The federal trial in Chicago carried echoes of a state trial in 2008, in which a jury acquitted Kelly on charges of producing child sexual abuse imagery. That trial focused on one videotape, which prosecutors said showed Kelly sexually abusing and urinating on a girl when she was 14. After finding him not guilty, some jurors told reporters after that trial that the lack of testimony from the young woman — who had denied to a grand jury that she appeared in the video — had been a significant barrier to convicting Kelly.

During this trial, which started in August, prosecutors removed that barrier. The woman at the center of the 2008 trial testified, identifying herself as the girl who was sexually abused by Kelly in the video. Prosecutors showed jurors clips from that video and from two others that they described as footage of Kelly sexually abusing the woman when she was underage.
Much of the testimony in the trial, which was held at Everett M. Dirksen US Courthouse in downtown Chicago, revolved around the events surrounding that first trial.
Prosecutors accused Kelly of working to obstruct an investigation into his treatment of underage girls in the early 2000s by hiring people to help him recover missing videos of his sexual abuse of children and persuading the woman at the centre of the earlier trial to lie on his behalf.
A key development for prosecutors came when that woman decided in 2019 — months after the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly” aired sexual abuse allegations against Kelly — to cooperate with investigators.
“I no longer wanted to carry his lies,” the woman testified.
The woman testified that Kelly had persuaded her to falsely deny to a grand jury in 2002 that it was her on the tape, and that she had ever had a sexual relationship with him. Another key witness, Charles Freeman, testified that Kelly called him in 2001, asking for help recovering some “stolen tapes”. Freeman said that over a period of several years, he had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Kelly and his associates as part of an effort to retrieve missing tapes.
Three other women, all of whom were identified by pseudonyms, testified in the trial, saying that Kelly sexually abused them when they were underage. A fifth accuser who had been expected to testify did not appear.
Kelly declined to testify. He did not testify in the 2008 trial in Chicago or the one in New York, either.
A lawyer representing him, Jennifer Bonjean, argued in court that the prosecution of Kelly was the outcome of a rush to judgment during the #MeToo movement, describing him as a “victim of extortion and financial exploitation”. She sought to cast doubt on the women’s stories and to portray them as testifying for money and self-protection, highlighting the fact that the woman at the centre of the 2008 trial had an immunity deal with prosecutors that protects her from perjury charges for lying to the grand jury at the time.
The woman acknowledged that she had an immunity deal, and that she had lied years ago, but insisted that she was telling the truth now. The jury apparently believed her. - New York Times

R. Kelly erneut der Sexualstraftaten an Minderjährigen schuldig,"Ex-Popstar R. Kelly ist erneut wegen Sexualstraftaten verurteilt worden. Eine Jury in Chicago befand den 55-Jährigen am Mittwoch schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben, wie US-Medien am Mittwoch übereinstimmend berichteten.
Verurteilung bereits in New York
Erst vor einigen Wochen war der ""I believe I can fly""-Sänger in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen des Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt worden. In einem zweiten Prozess in Chicago war er in 13 Punkten angeklagt, unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen und der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen.
Seit 2019 im Gefängnis
Laut ""New York Times"" sprachen die zwölf Geschworenen ihn in 7 Punkten frei - unter anderem vom Vorwurf der Behinderung der Justiz. Das Strafmaß wird zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt verkündet, Kelly droht erneut eine mehrere Jahrzehnte lange Haftstrafe. Kelly hatte die Vorwürfe stets zurückgewiesen. Er sitzt seit Sommer 2019 im Gefängnis. Zwei weitere angeklagte Ex-Angestellte Kellys wurden freigesprochen.
Video liefert Beweis
In Chicago ging es auch um ein bereits viele Jahre bekanntes Video, das Kelly zeigen soll, wie er ein 14-jähriges Mädchen missbraucht und auf sie uriniert. In diesem Fall war der Musiker 2008 von einer Jury bereits freigesprochen worden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft hatte ihm vorgeworfen, das Opfer unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit sie nicht in dem Prozess aussagt. In dem neuen Prozess hatte die mittlerweile volljährige Frau aber bestätigt, dass sie die Person in dem Video ist.
Weitere Aufarbeitung der MeToo-Ära
Das Verfahren ist - nach Fällen wie denen von Filmproduzent Harvey Weinstein und Komiker Bill Cosby - eine weitere viel beachtete juristische Aufarbeitung in der MeToo-Ära. Erste Anschuldigungen gegen den 1967 in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborenen Musiker wurden bereits vor rund 25 Jahren bekannt. Doch der Musik-Koloss schien unangreifbar auf seinem Pop-Thron und blieb lange Zeit auf freiem Fuß. Mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben, mehreren Grammys und anderen Auszeichnungen gehörte er zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern des späten 20. Jahrhunderts.
Aber spätestens als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation ""Surviving R. Kelly"" die Anschuldigungen zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer. Stars distanzierten sich von ihm, zudem Radiosender, Streaming-Dienste und dann auch sein Musiklabel RCA, das zu Sony Music gehört.

Tribunal considera cantor R. Kelly culpado de múltiplas acusações em julgamento de abuso sexual,"Por Brendan O’Brien e Kanishka Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) – O cantor norte-americano R. Kelly foi considerado culpado, nesta quarta-feira, da acusação de atrair meninas menores de idade para fazer sexo com ele, mas foi inocentado de uma acusação de obstruir um caso de 2008 que terminou com sua absolvição, de acordo com reportagens da mídia.
Em seu mais recente julgamento, o músico –cujo nome completo é Robert Sylvester Kelly– foi considerado culpado em seis de 13 acusações em um julgamento federal, de acordo com a emissora CBS Chicago.
O júri no Tribunal Distrital dos EUA em Chicago condenou o cantor de R&B multipremiado, de 55 anos, por múltiplas acusações de exploração sexual de uma criança, sedução de uma mulher e posse de material contendo pornografia infantil.
Kelly está entre uma série de pessoas famosas que foram condenadas por má conduta sexual durante o movimento #MeToo contra o assédio e o abuso sexual nos últimos anos.
Durante o julgamento de cinco semanas, várias mulheres tomaram a palavra e disseram aos jurados que Kelly abusou sexualmente delas quando eram menores. O júri também viu um vídeo de Kelly molestando sua afilhada, que testemunhou que o abuso começou nos anos 1990, quando ela era adolescente.
Kelly e seus dois corréus, Milton “June” Brown e Derrel McDavid, foram absolvidos das acusações de que conspiraram para receber pornografia infantil. Kelly e McDavid também foram absolvidos de acusações de que conspiraram para obstruir a Justiça em um caso contra Kelly em 2002, segundo o jornal Chicago Tribune.
Em junho, Kelly foi condenado a 30 anos de prisão por um tribunal federal de Nova York por extorsão e acusações de prostituição. Esse julgamento amplificou as acusações que já perseguiam o cantor do sucesso vencedor do Grammy “I Believe I Can Fly” por duas décadas.

R. Kelly timeline: Shining star to convicted sex offender,"R&B superstar R. Kelly’s musical accomplishments have long been shadowed by allegations that he sexually abused women and children. Now the singer has been found guilty in his hometown of Chicago on child pornography charges, but acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008.
The verdict comes after he was sentenced in June in New York to three decades behind bars on federal sex trafficking charges. While Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, has vehemently denied the allegations, his accusers testified that he subjected them to perverse and sadistic whims when they were underage.
A timeline of Kelly’s life through his rise and fall as an R&B artist:
— 1990: R. Kelly’s R&B group MGM wins the $100,000 grand prize on the syndicated television talent show “Big Break,” hosted by Natalie Cole. Because of money disagreements, that is the last time the group performs together.
— January 1992: R. Kelly & Public Announcement debuts “Born Into The ’90s.” Released a year later, the album goes platinum.
— November 1993: His album “12 Play” is released and sells more than 5 million copies. Hit singles include “Sex Me” and “Bump N’ Grind,” which becomes the longest-running No. 1 R&B song in more than 30 years.
— Aug. 31, 1994: At age 27, R. Kelly marries 15-year-old R&B singer Aaliyah D. Haughton in a secret ceremony arranged by Kelly at a Chicago hotel. The marriage is annulled months later because of Aaliyah’s age. (Aaliyah died in a plane crash seven years later, at age 22.)
— November 1996: R. Kelly releases his third album, “R. Kelly.” A month later, he incorporates Rockland Records. His song “I Believe I Can Fly,” from the “Space Jam” soundtrack, peaks at No. 2 on the Billboard pop chart. The same year, he marries 22-year-old Andrea Lee, a dancer from his touring troupe. The couple has three children: Joanne, Jaya and Robert Jr.
— February 1998: Kelly wins three Grammys for “I Believe I Can Fly.”
— August 2001: Tracy Sampson files a lawsuit against Kelly, alleging their sex was illegal under Illinois law because he was in “a position of authority” over her. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.
— Feb. 8, 2002: The Chicago Sun-Times reports that it received a videotape allegedly showing Kelly having sex with a minor. The paper reports that Chicago police began investigating allegations about Kelly and the same girl three years earlier. At the time, the girl and her parents deny she was having sex with Kelly.
The day the news breaks, Kelly performs at the opening ceremonies for the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
— June 5, 2002: Kelly is indicted in Chicago on child pornography charges related to the sex tape. He pleads not guilty and is released on $750,000 bail.

— Sept. 29, 2012: Kelly is nominated for two Soul Train Awards, making him the most nominated act ever at the awards show.
— July 17, 2017: BuzzFeed reports on parents’ claims that Kelly brainwashed their daughters and was keeping them in an abusive “cult.” One woman says she was with Kelly willingly. Activists launch the #MuteRKelly movement, calling for boycotts of his music.
— May 2018: Spotify cuts R. Kelly’s music from its playlists, citing its policy on hateful conduct. Shortly after, Apple and Pandora also stop promoting his music. Kelly’s team pushes back, noting other artists on Spotify have been accused or convicted of crimes.
— Jan. 3, 2019: Lifetime airs the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly,” which revisits old allegations and brings new ones into the spotlight. The BBC’s “R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes,” released the previous year, alleges the singer held women against their will.

"R. Kelly convicted of multiple child pornography and enticement charges, acquitted on others","By Sonia Moghe, CNN
(CNN) -- R. Kelly was convicted of multiple child pornography charges at a Chicago federal trial and acquitted on others, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Kelly was convicted on three of four child pornography counts and acquitted on charges that he conspired to obstruct justice at his 2008 trial which stemmed from a 2002 state case.
He was also found guilty on three of five counts of enticement of a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity.
Jurors deliberated for about 10 hours after listening to three weeks-worth of testimony, including from one woman who testified anonymously that Kelly sexually abused her and recorded the interactions when she was as young as 14.
The woman was one of five minors who prosecutors allege Kelly sexually abused in the late 1990s by making explicit videos with four of them.

R Kelly found guilty on child abuse images and sex abuse charges,"A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R Kelly of several child abuse images and sex abuse charges in his home town of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child abuse images and three counts of child enticement.
But the jury acquitted him on a fourth abuse images count as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him of fixing his state child abuse images trial in 2008. He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child abuse images and for two further enticement charges.
His two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges.
The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old will not be eligible for release until he is about 80.
Two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly – one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
Jurors on Wednesday wrote several questions to the judge, at least one indicating the panelists were grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only needed to find one.
At trial, prosecutors sought to paint a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in starstuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover videos of child abuse he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1m to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Kelly’s associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted McDavid, Kelly’s longtime business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, an associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child abuse images.
Kelly faced 13 counts. A conviction of just one count of child abuse images carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child abuse images carries a mandatory minimum of five years. Judges can order that defendants sentenced earlier in separate cases serve their new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences.
During closing arguments on Tuesday, Kelly’s attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” she told jurors.
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said of the prosecution’s case.
In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Four Kelly accusers testified, all referred to by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify.
Sitting nearby in a suit and face mask, Kelly often averted his eyes and looked down as his accusers spoke.
Jane, 37, was the government’s star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents would not testify.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial.
On the witness stand for two days at the end of August, Jane paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue when she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her aged 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video did not testify. At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane said she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video, saying part of her reason for lying was that she cared for Kelly and did not want to get him into trouble.
Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 – the age of consent in Illinois – when Kelly began pursuing her for sex.
Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster”, saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray.",2022-09-14T22:15:25Z,https://www.theguardian.com,The Guardian

R. Kelly funnet skyldig - igjen
Artisten R. Kelly (55) er funnet skyldig i seks av 13 tiltalepunkter i en ny rettssak der han var anklaget for blant annet overgrep mot mindreårige.
Publisert: Oppdatert for mindre enn 20 minutter siden
Juryen har kommet til enighet etter 11 timers betenkningstid, melder CBS Chicago onsdag kveld norsk tid.
R. Kelly, døpt Robert Sylvester Kelly, er funnet skyldig i seks av de 13 tiltalepunktene. De 13 tiltalepunktene omhandlet overgrepsmateriale, motvirkning av rettsvesenet og lokking av mindreårige til seksuelle handlinger.
Han er ifølge CBS funnet skyldig i tre tilfeller av besittelse av overgrepsmateriale mot mindreårige og tre tilfeller av barnelokking. Han ble altså frikjent på syv av tiltalepunktene.
Den amerikanske uttrykket brukt i tre av punktene er «child enticement» som går på å lokke eller presse barn til det som ifølge loven vil være et seksualovergrep.
Viste videoer i retten
Kelly var anklaget for å ha lokket fem jenter til seksuelle handlinger og for å ha kjøpt tilbake videoer som skulle vise hans delaktighet.
I denne runden, som har vart i fire uker, har over 30 vitnet i rettet. Det er også vist klipp fra tre overgrepsvideoer som påtalemakten mener viser Kelly forgripe seg mot sin 14-årige guddatter.
Fire kvinner har anklaget artisten for å forgripe seg på dem da de var jenter. Guddatteren har vitnet under et pseudonym og har forklart at Kelly forgrep seg på henne hundrevis av ganger fra hun var 14 til hun var 18.
Se video om rettssaken i fjor:
Allerede dømt til 30 år i fengsel
I juli ble det klart at R & B-veteranen må sone 30 år i fengsel, etter at han fjor høst ble dømt for menneskehandel og seksuelle overgrep.
I 2008 ble R. Kelly frifunnet for å ha laget en video politiet hevdet viste ham ha seksuell omgang med en 13 år gammel jente. I august startet en ny rettssak mot artisten.
Forskjellen denne gangen er at kvinnen, som i dag er i 30-årene, skulle vitne. AP skriver at påtalemyndigheten mener Kelly betalte og truet kvinnen til å ikke vitne i 2008.
Kellys med-tiltalte ble frifunnet på alle punkter.

R.Kelly convicted on multiple sex charges,"Grammy-winning singer R. Kelly has been found guilty on charges of luring underage girls to have sex with him but cleared of obstructing a 2008 state case that ended with his acquittal.
In his latest trial, Kelly - whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly - was found guilty on Wednesday on six out of 13 counts in the federal trial, CBS Chicago reported.
A jury in US District Court in Chicago convicted the 55-year-old Grammy-winning musical artist of multiple counts of sexual exploitation of a child, enticement of a female, and possession of material containing child pornography.
Kelly is among the most prominent people convicted of sexual misbehaviour following the #MeToo movement against harassment and abuse in recent years.
During the five-week trial, several women took the stand and told jurors Kelly sexually abused them when they were minors.
The jury also saw a video of Kelly molesting his goddaughter, who testified the abuse began in the 1990s when she was a teenager.
Kelly and both his co-defendants - Milton ‘June’ Brown and Derrel McDavid - were acquitted on charges they conspired to receive child pornography.
Kelly and McDavid were also acquitted on charges they conspired to obstruct justice in Kelly’s 2002 Cook County case, the Chicago Tribune reported.
The men were accused of trying to bribe and threaten witnesses in the 2008 Illinois case in which Kelly was found not guilty on 14 counts of child pornography.
In June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on his conviction in a New York federal court on racketeering and prostitution charges.
That trial amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the smash hit I Believe I Can Fly for two decades.

R. Kelly Found Guilty in Child Pornography Case,"Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images
R. Kelly was found guilty on Wednesday, September 14 in his Chicago federal court child pornography case, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Prosecutors in Kelly’s Illinois trial presented evidence that he targeted minors for sexual abuse and made child pornography recording these actions. “Kelly and his team — they did their level best … to cover up the fact that Robert Kelly, R. Kelly the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator. They did their best, but in the end, they failed,” prosecutor Elizabeth Pozolo said during her closing on Monday, September, according to the Chicago Tribune’s Megan Crepeau. “We are here today because those tapes that they concealed for 20 years are no longer their secret. You have seen the tapes.” The prosecution repeatedly discussed “Jane,” Kelly’s former goddaughter, who accused him of sexual abuse. Jane, now 37, testified on August 18 that Kelly had sexually abused her “hundreds” of times while she was a minor. Jane told jurors that she was the teen girl in a video-recording that was the crux of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial in state court.
Jane told jurors that she was merely 14 when this video was taped, making Kelly about 30, the Associated Press reported. Jane refused to participate in Kelly’s previous Chicago trial and did not take the stand. Several members of that jury previously said her absence is why they acquitted Kelly. During the current trial, Jane said she lied to the grand jury two decades ago when she said she was not in the tape. “I was afraid something bad would happen to Robert,” Jane said during her testimony. “I was protecting him.” Jane, explaining why she kept the truth a secret, also said: “I also did not want that person to be me,” and “I was ashamed.” Eventually, she said she began talking about what had occurred with Kelly after becoming “exhausted living with his lies.” In her closing, Pozolo repeatedly discussed Jane’s words. “That child, who had no prior sexual experiences in her life, was forced to lay on that floor while that man sitting right over there urinated on her. That degrading act is forever captured on that video,” Crepeau quoted Pozolo as saying. “That abuse is forever memorialized … Who does that? Who uses a 14-year-old child to film a video like this? This man. Robert Kelly.” Three other accusers — “Pauline,” “Tracy,” and “Nia” — testified under pseudonyms. Kelly was convicted for making tapes of his abuse of Jane.
Kelly and his co-defendants, Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, were found not guilty of conspiring to receive child pornography, according to the Chicago Tribune. Kelly and McDavid were found not guilty of trying to obstruct justice in his 2002 case.
During attorney Jennifer Bonjean’s closing, she claimed her client Kelly faced a disadvantage during this trial as jurors already knew about “not particularly favorable” information, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Bonjean worked to chip away at elements of the indictment. But, as the Sun-Times pointed out, she put forth “just a few technical defenses” on the child pornography counts. She asked whether these recordings had traveled across state lines and then questioned: “Was his purpose to create child pornography?” While Jane has been dishonest in the past, Bonjean argued, “that is not to say that she has told falsehoods about everything.” Bonjean reportedly told jurors of Kelly and Jane: “We’re not denying that this relationship commenced…and you heard the testimony. You will decide when the relationship commenced.” Kelly, who has been jailed since his July 2019 arrest, was sentenced to 30 years in prison following his September 27, 2021 Brooklyn federal court trial.",2022-09-14T22:09:29Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture

Trotz zahlreicher kursierender Geschichten über Sex mit Minderjährigen schien es jahrzehntelang so, als sei R. Kelly unangreifbar. Doch die Vergangenheit holte ihn schließlich ein.
Chicago - Ex-Popstar R. Kelly ist erneut wegen Sexualstraftaten verurteilt worden. Eine Jury in Chicago befand den 55-Jährigen am Mittwoch schuldig, Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt und Kinderpornografie angefertigt zu haben, wie US-Medien am Mittwoch übereinstimmend berichteten.
Erst vor einigen Wochen war der „I believe I can fly“-Sänger in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen des Missbrauchs Minderjähriger verurteilt worden. In einem zweiten Prozess in Chicago war er in 13 Punkten angeklagt, unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen und der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen.
Laut „New York Times“ sprachen die zwölf Geschworenen ihn in 7 Punkten frei - unter anderem vom Vorwurf der Behinderung der Justiz. Das Strafmaß wird zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt verkündet, Kelly droht erneut eine mehrere Jahrzehnte lange Haftstrafe. Kelly hatte die Vorwürfe stets zurückgewiesen.

Kelly has been found guilty of producing child pornography and luring underage girls into sex acts by a jury for his federal child pornography trial at Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago on Sept. 14. The disgraced rapper, 55, was found guilty of six of 13 charges against him, which included “four counts of producing child porn, one of conspiring to obstruct justice by fixing the 2008 trial, one of conspiring to receive child porn, two of actually receiving it and five of enticing minors for sex”, according to NBC New York. One of the charges he was acquitted of is attempting to rig his 2008 state child pornography trial, for which he was not found guilty. The minimum prison sentence for each count varies between five and 20 years, per Rolling Stone.

R. Kelly verdict: Singer found guilty in Chicago trial,"For the second consecutive summer, a federal jury has convicted Chicago-born R&B superstar R. Kelly.
The decision comes at the end of a month-long trial featuring roughly 30 witnesses, including four women who said Kelly sexually abused them when they were teenagers in the 1990s. Jurors viewed graphic videos at the heart of the feds’ case against Kelly, and they heard that Kelly enlisted others to hunt such videos down when he first faced prosecution in the 2000s.
Still, an aggressive alliance of defense attorneys spent the last several weeks working to undermine the feds at every turn, hoping to inject serious doubt into the jurors’ minds.
Kelly is already serving a 30-year sentence for his racketeering conviction last year in New York. Federal prosecutors in Chicago and New York revealed twin indictments against the superstar in July 2019, and authorities effectively ended his freedom when they arrested him outside of Trump Tower in Chicago that month. His New York conviction is expected to keep him behind bars until at least his late 70s.

In the Chicago trial, Kelly faced charges alleging child pornography, obstruction of justice and the enticement of minors into criminal sexual activity. The case involved five accusers, four videos, 13 counts and 24 years of accusations dating back to 1996.
On trial alongside Kelly was his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and former assistant, Milton ""June"" Brown. Kelly and Brown declined to testify, but McDavid spent more than two days on the witness stand answering questions in his own defense.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo told jurors during closing arguments that ""Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years. He committed horrible crimes against children. And he didn’t do it alone.""
Defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean told them Kelly ""did some beautiful things when it came to making music, and he should not be stripped of every bit of humanity that he has.""
Central to Kelly’s latest trial was the testimony of a woman known to jurors as ""Jane."" Though she denied for years that she appeared on the notorious video that led to Kelly’s first trial on child pornography charges in 2008, Jane finally took the stand last month to testify against him.
Now in her late 30s, Jane said the singer began to sexually abuse her when she was around 14 and Kelly was in his early 30s. She said it began after she asked him to be her godfather. She told jurors that three videos at issue in Kelly’s latest trial depicted her abuse. Among them was the same video at the center of Kelly’s 2008 trial.
That video was sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times in 2002. The newspaper turned it over to police.
After hearing from Jane, jurors viewed 17 clips from the three videos. Though their monitors were blocked from public view, the audio could still be heard in the courtroom, including a female voice repeatedly referring to her ""14-year-old"" body.

As the trial progressed, jurors heard from three women who also testified about sexual encounters involving Kelly and Jane when Jane was underage, corroborating Jane’s testimony.
One of them was Lisa Van Allen, a former girlfriend and longtime accuser of Kelly’s who appeared in the Lifetime docuseries ""Surviving R. Kelly."" She testified along with two others — Charles Freeman and Keith Murrell — about attempts to track down videos of Kelly and Jane amid Kelly’s child-pornography prosecution in the 2000s.
All three testified under immunity deals.
Van Allen long claimed that she was 17 when she met Kelly and first had a sexual encounter with him. But in this trial, she acknowledged they actually crossed paths when she was 18. Later that same year, in 1998, she said she had a three-way sexual encounter with Kelly and Jane, who Kelly insisted was his 16-year-old neighbor.
Jane turned 14 in 1998.
Later, in 2000, Van Allen said she took a VHS tape from Kelly that featured three sex scenes. Two allegedly depicted Kelly and Jane, while the third featured Kelly, Jane and Van Allen. She said she sent the tape to Murrell, a friend of hers, because she didn’t want it in her possession. She said she learned in 2007 that he still had it — and that it could be for sale.
Van Allen said she then reached out to Kelly, who promised her $250,000 to spend however she needed in order to get the tape back. Van Allen and Murrell were ultimately paid $100,000 each by Kelly and McDavid to return the tape, according to charges in the case.
Freeman testified that Kelly reached out to him in 2001 and asked him to recover some tapes that he’d lost. Freeman said he wound up talking to McDavid and a private investigator, Jack Palladino, and he said he demanded $1 million to recover a ""performance tape.""
Freeman said he found the tape at a home near Atlanta and ""immediately"" made copies. His description of the video on the tape matched two of the videos described by Jane.
Though Freeman never got his $1 million, he said he collected more than a half-million dollars in mostly cash payments over the years from Kelly’s associates. He said he only handed his remaining copies of the tape over in 2019 to his attorney, who gave them to law enforcement, when he learned he could be facing charges.
McDavid took the stand in the trial’s final days of testimony, denying key aspects of the story told by Freeman, Van Allen and Murrell. He called Freeman a ""rotten piece of sh—,"" and he said Van Allen was caught in ""lie after lie after lie"" when she testified against Kelly during his 2008 trial.
McDavid said he didn’t believe the repeated claims of sexual abuse leveled against Kelly in the 2000s. But he acknowledged that, after sitting through Kelly’s latest trial, he’d ""learned a lot of things"" and was ""embarrassed.""
Finally, jurors heard from three additional accusers, referred to in court as ""Pauline,"" ""Tracy"" and ""Nia."" A fifth accuser, ""Brittany,"" did not take the stand. Kelly is charged with enticing all four of those women, and Jane, into criminal sexual activity.
Pauline, now in her late 30s, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14. Pauline said she once caught Jane naked with Kelly and that the singer encouraged the girls to kiss and fondle each other. Pauline said she began having sexual intercourse with Kelly when she was 15 or 16.
Tracy, now 40, insisted she was 16 when she was introduced to Kelly in 1999 by her boss during an internship at Epic Records. She said her encounters with Kelly soon turned sexual, and she described an incident in which Kelly told her and Jane to perform oral sex on him.
Tracy filed a lawsuit against Kelly in 2001. At the time, she claimed she met Kelly in 2000, when she was 17.
Finally, Nia testified that she met Kelly at age 15 in 1996. She said she saw Kelly at a mall in Atlanta, approached him seeking an autograph but also walked away with his phone number. She said they began to talk on the phone, and eventually she told Kelly her age.
Nia alleged that Kelly made arrangements for her to travel to see one of his concerts in Minneapolis. She said she brought a rose for him along on the trip. The morning after the concert, she said Kelly visited her in a hotel room, touched her breasts and began to masturbate. Once he finished, she said he left ""in a rush.""
""When he left, the rose was still there,"" Nia said.
Nia said she then spent the summer with family in Chicago. While in town, she said she and her cousins visited Kelly in his recording studio. During that visit, she said she slipped into a hallway to see Kelly, who made out with her and fondled her.
After that visit, she said Kelly stopped returning her calls.",2022-09-14T22:05:38Z,https://www.fox4news.com,FOX 4 News

Sin embargo, el jurado lo absolvió de un cuarto cargo de pornografía, así como de conspiración para obstruir la justicia.
El cantante estadounidense R. Kelly ha sido declarado culpable en su ciudad natal, Chicago, de varios cargos de pornografía infantil y abuso sexual, informa AP el 14 de septiembre.
Un jurado federal declaró culpable al artista, de 55 años, de tres cargos de pornografía infantil y tres cargos de seducción de menores. Sin embargo, fue absuelto de un cuarto cargo de pornografía, un cargo de conspiración para obstruir la justicia relacionado con su juicio de 2008, tres cargos de captación de pornografía infantil y otros dos cargos de incitación sexual.
Tanto el cantante como sus presuntos cómplices intentan ser procesados desde 2008.
Los socios del rapero, Derrel McDavid y Milton Brown, fueron declarados inocentes de todos los cargos. El primero habría ayudado a Kelly a modificar las pruebas para salirse con la suya durante el juicio de 2008, mientras que Brown fue acusado de recibir los materiales pornográficos con menores de edad. Los tres inculpados han negado los cargos presentados en 2019.
Además, en junio de 2008, un jurado del condado de Cook absolvió a Kelly de los 21 cargos de pornografía infantil ligados a un video en el que aparecía el rapero manteniendo relaciones sexuales con una menor identificada como Jane. La mujer, que ahora tiene unos 30 años y es mencionada en los documentos judiciales como 'Menor 1' conoció a Kelly en los años 90, cuando tenía 12 o 13 años.
En el juicio en Chicago, Jane dijo que mintió a un gran jurado estatal hace muchos años, cuando dijo que no era ella la que aparecía en el video. Añadió que uno de los motivos por los que mintió era que se preocupaba por Kelly y no quería meterlo en problemas.
Jane declaró que tenía 15 años cuando tuvieron relaciones sexuales por primera vez. Cuando se le preguntó cuántas veces intimaron sexualmente antes de cumplir los 18 años, respondió en voz baja: ""Innumerables veces. Centenares"".
La presunta víctima también testificó que cuando sus padres se enfrentaron a Kelly a principios de la década de 2000, él se arrodilló y les suplicó perdón. Ella dijo que pedía a sus padres que no tomaran medidas contra el artista porque lo amaba.",2022-09-14T22:02:51Z,https://actualidad.rt.com,RT en Español

Chicago, Sep 15: A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R&B singer and songwriter R. Kelly of at least 1 charge of child pornography.
The jury in Chicago came to the conclusion after sifting through evidence and arguments on charges accusing the singer of producing child pornography and enticing minors for sex.
Acquitted over conspiracy to obstruct justice in 2008 trial
R. Kelly was found not guilty of obstructing a 2008 case that ended with his acquittal. He and two associates had been accused of trying to bribe and threaten witness in the case.
He was also found not guilty on a fourth pornography count, on three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and two encitement charges.

CBS Chicago reported that R. Kelly was found guilty on six out of 13 counts on the trial.
The artist's two co-defendents, a longtime business manager and another close associate, were found not guilty on all charges.
Prosecutors argued that R. Kelly used his fame and wealth to sexually abuse fans, some of them minors. During the trial, several women took the stand and told jurors that Kelly abused them when they were minors.
Kelly has already been convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York, where he has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.
In Chicago, a conviction of one count of child pornography carries a minimum sentence of five years.

R. Kelly Found Guilty For 6 Of 13 Charges In Federal Child Pornography Trial,"A verdict has been reached in the federal trial of R. Kelly, who faced 13 charges, including child pornography. Of the charges, Kelly was found guilty of three counts of child pornography, and three counts of enticing minors for sex, while being acquitted on seven others.
Each of the child pornography charges carries a minimum of 10 years in prison.
While Kelly was found guilty, his two alleged co-conspirators, Derrell McDavid and Milton ""June"" Brown, were both acquitted on all charges. They had been accused of fixing Kelly’s 2008 trial for state child porn charges by allegedly intimidating and paying off witnesses.

It took the jury a total of 11 hours of deliberation before reaching a verdict. They began meeting on Tuesday afternoon and came to a decision on Wednesday.
“What R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannice Appenteng said in the prosecution's closing arguments, earlier this week. “And what the people around him wanted... they wanted to help their boss, including helping him get away with it.”
Kelly's defense attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, had argued on Tuesday: ""This man did some beautiful things with his music. And he should not be stripped of every bit of humanity. I ask more importantly and to remember each count counts and take the time you need...Mr. Kelly deserves it no matter what you think of him.""
Wednesday marks the second time that Kelly has been convicted in the past year, after being sentenced to 30 years in federal prison by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York, back in June.

Le chanteur R. Kelly désormais reconnu coupable de pédopornographie,"R. Kelly au tribunal Leighton de Chicago, aux Etats-Unis. Le 17 septembre 2019. ANTONIO PEREZ / AFP
R. Kelly, star déchue du R’n’B déjà condamnée à trente ans de prison en juin pour des crimes sexuels commis sur des jeunes femmes parfois adolescentes, a été condamné, mercredi 14 septembre, pour production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur, selon le journal Chicago Tribune.
Le procureur John Lausch a révélé au média de la troisième ville des Etats-Unis que la peine minimale à additionner serait de dix ans, pouvant aller jusqu’à quatre-vingt-dix ans de prison pour Robert Sylvester Kelly, âgé de 55 ans.
Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur de jeunes adolescentes, dont l’une n’avait que 14 ans, ont été montrés pendant le procès. L’artiste avait été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 à New York d’avoir piloté pendant trois décennies un « système » d’exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes.

Le chanteur, mondialement connu pour son tube I Believe I Can Fly et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, a en revanche été acquitté par un jury fédéral pour d’autres chefs d’inculpation d’obstruction à la justice. Lui et deux anciens associés – également acquittés mercredi – étaient accusés d’avoir perturbé le cours de son procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, au cours duquel le jury l’avait déclaré non coupable. Il leur était reproché d’avoir à la fois menacé et corrompu une victime, qui n’avait alors pas témoigné. Aujourd’hui âgée de 37 ans, elle s’est cette fois exprimée.
Système organisé
Ce procès avait été considéré comme une étape majeure du mouvement #metoo : c’était la première fois que la plupart des plaignantes étaient des femmes noires et qu’elles accusaient un artiste noir. Pendant des décennies, le succès de R. Kelly avait été terni par des soupçons de violences sexuelles, objet de rumeurs persistantes. Il était longtemps parvenu à les faire taire avec des accords financiers prévoyant des clauses de confidentialité.

Dès 2017, deux femmes, Kenyette Barnes et Oronike Odeleye, avaient lancé un appel au boycott de ses chansons, en partageant le hashtag « Mute R. Kelly » (« Faites taire R. Kelly »). En janvier 2019, la série documentaire Surviving R. Kelly avait enfoncé le clou. Plusieurs victimes y décrivaient le chanteur comme manipulateur, violent et obsédé par les très jeunes filles.
Lors du procès à New York, les victimes avaient décrit les tactiques utilisées par le chanteur pour attirer de très jeunes femmes en se servant de sa célébrité, et avec la complicité de son entourage. Beaucoup d’entre elles avaient rencontré la star à des concerts, après lesquels on leur glissait un petit papier indiquant les coordonnées de R. Kelly.

R. Kelly condannato per reati sessuali su minori,"Kelly è stato condannato da una giuria di Chicago per tre capi di imputazione di pornografia ai danni di minori e assolto da un quarto. Colpevole anche di tre dei cinque capi di imputazione per adescamento di minorenni per attività sessuale. R. Kelly, star dell'R&B americano, è stato invece assolto dall'accusa di aver cospirato per ostacolare la giustizia in un processo del 2008. Ora, per i nuovicapi d’accusa rischia fino a 20 anni di prigione.

Il verdetto è arrivato dopo che la giuria ha avuto bisogno di circa 10 ore di camera di consiglio prima di deliberate, alla fine di un processo che è durato tre settimane. Una donna ha testimoniato che R. Kelly l'aveva abusata sessualmente, filmandola, quando aveva 14 anni. La vittima era una delle cinque minorenni che, secondo quanto affermato dall'accusa, sono state hanno subito lo stesso trattamento dal cantante negli anni 90.
R. Kelly era stato arrestato a Chicago nel 2019 con le accuse di adescamento di minori, pedopornografia e ostruzione alla giustizia, mentre era libero su cauzione per un precedente caso, sempre nello Stato dell'Illinois, di sospetti abusi sessuali su quattro donne, tre delle quali erano minorenni all'epoca dei fatti.

""Anche se il sesso è stata certamente una delle armi che lei ha usato, questo non è un caso riguardante il sesso. È un caso di violenza, crudeltà e controllo"", ha detto la giudice Ann Donnelly in aula. L'attenzione sulla condotta sessuale di Kelly è emersa dopo la nascita del movimento #MeToo ed è aumentata con la diffusione della docuserie ""Surviving R. Kelly"".

Le chanteur R. Kelly reconnu coupable de pédopornographie,"l'essentiel Mondialement connu pour son tube ""I Believe I Can Fly"" et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 ans, avait déjà été condamné pour des crimes sexuels commis sur des jeunes femmes parfois adolescentes.
R. Kelly, star déchue du R&B déjà condamnée à 30 ans de prison en juin pour des crimes sexuels commis sur des jeunes femmes parfois adolescentes, a été reconnu coupable de pédopornographie jeudi 15 septembre à Chicago.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 ans, a été condamné pour production de pédopornographie et détournement de mineur. Le chanteur, mondialement connu pour son tube I Believe I Can Fly et ses 75 millions de disques vendus, a en revanche été acquitté par un jury fédéral pour d'autres chefs d'inculpation d'obstruction à la justice.
""De 10 à 90 ans de prison""
Lui et deux anciens associés étaient accusés d'avoir perturbé le cours de son procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, au cours duquel le jury l'avait déclaré non coupable. Il leur était reproché d'avoir à la fois menacé et corrompu une victime, qui n'avait alors pas témoigné. Aujourd'hui âgée de 37 ans, elle s'est cette fois exprimée. Des extraits de vidéos montrant des violences sexuelles commises par R. Kelly sur des jeunes filles, dont l'une n'avait que 14 ans, ont été diffusés pendant le procès.
Le jury composé de 12 personnes a mis environ 11 heures pour parvenir à ce verdict, qui pourrait venir ajouter une lourde peine de prison aux 30 ans de réclusion auxquels R. Kelly a déjà été condamné. Sa peine, qui sera fixée ultérieurement, pourrait aller ""de dix à 90 ans de prison"", a précisé le bureau du procureur dans un communiqué.
""Système"" d'exploitation sexuelle
L'artiste avait déjà été reconnu coupable en septembre 2021 à New York d'avoir piloté pendant trois décennies un ""système"" d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes. Ce procès avait été considéré comme une étape majeure du mouvement #MeToo : c'était la première fois que la majorité des plaignantes étaient des femmes noires et qu'elles accusaient un artiste noir.
Pendant des décennies, le succès de R. Kelly avait été terni par des soupçons de violences sexuelles, objet de rumeurs persistantes. Il était longtemps parvenu à les faire taire avec des accords financiers prévoyant des clauses de confidentialité.

Dès 2017, deux femmes, Kenyette Barnes et Oronike Odeleye, avaient lancé un appel au boycott de ses chansons, en partageant le hashtag #MuteR.Kelly (""Faites taire R. Kelly""). En janvier 2019, la série documentaire Surviving R. Kelly avait enfoncé le clou. Plusieurs victimes y décrivaient le chanteur comme manipulateur, violent et obsédé par les très jeunes filles.
Lors du procès à New York, les victimes avaient décrit les tactiques utilisées par le chanteur pour attirer de très jeunes femmes en se servant de sa célébrité, et avec la complicité de son entourage.

"R. Kelly convicted on multiple counts of child pornography, acquitted of fixing 2008 child porn trial","A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography charges in his hometown of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who was once one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography, but was acquitted on a charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice that accused him of fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008.
The decision comes after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, he won't be eligible for release until he is around 80.
The Chicago trial was, in many ways, a do-over of Kelly's 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both.
The legal challenges for Kelly — who rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side to become a Grammy-winning superstar — are not yet over. Two further trials are pending; one in Minnesota and another in state court in Chicago.
Kelly, who is known for his smash hit I Believe I Can Fly and for sex-infused songs such as Bump n' Grind, sold millions of albums even after abuse allegations began circulating in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries Surviving R. Kelly.",2022-09-14T21:59:25Z,https://www.cbc.ca,CBC.ca

Musician R Kelly has been found guilty of six counts out of 13 after a child abuse image trial.
The singer, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three of child enticement.
The singer was acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge, which accused him of fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008, as well as a fourth pornography count.
Kelly was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two more enticement charges.
The 90s hit-maker's co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges.
In June, he was convicted in New York of racketeering and sex trafficking and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
The jury began their deliberations on Tuesday, after listening to two weeks of testimony.
On Tuesday, Kelly's lawyer told the court that government witnesses were liars who testified with immunity so they could not be charged.

Le jury l’a reconnu coupable de trois chefs d’accusation de production d’images sexuelles impliquant des mineurs et de trois autres pour activités sexuelles impliquant de jeunes filles, selon le New York Times.
En juin dernier, R. Kelly (I Believe I Can Fly) avait écopé de 30 ans de prison pour trafic sexuel. Cette fois, il a été reconnu coupable de six des 13 chefs d’accusation qui pesaient contre lui.

R. Kelly Found Guilty on Six Counts in Child Porn Case,"Disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly was found guilty on Wednesday in his Chicago federal trial of several charges related to child porn.
Kelly was found guilty of six charges related to sexual abuse of minors, the production of child pornography and an alleged cover-up, Courthouse News Service reported. The jury chose to acquit the 55-year-old on seven additional charges.
Newsweek reported on Tuesday that one of the jurors in Kelly's Chicago trial had to be replaced after she endured a panic attack.
The R&B star, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, had been on trial along with one of his former assistants, Milton ""June"" Brown, and his previous business manager, Derrel McDavid. The charges brought against Kelly included sexual exploitation of children, child pornography and conspiracy to defraud the U.S.
For their part, Brown and McDavid face allegations that they had conspired to ""bribe and intimidate witnesses in a bid to conceal evidence pertaining to a 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges in Cook County, Illinois,"" Newsweek previously reported.
In another trial, jurors found Kelly guilty on nine counts of federal racketeering and sex trafficking. He was slapped with a 30-year prison sentence in June, although his attorneys previously stated that they would seek an appeal.
Kelly has maintained his innocence in both cases.
The musician had also faced trial in Illinois some 14 years ago but was acquitted on all charges, which were related to allegations that he had filmed himself having sex with a minor.
In July, prior to the beginning of the latest trial, Kelly was moved from a prison in Brooklyn to a Chicago detention center, Newsweek previously reported. He is currently listed as an inmate at the Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center, according to a database of federal prison inmates.
During her closing arguments, defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean referenced R. Kelly's hit single ""I Believe I Can Fly."" She argued that ""no matter what you ultimately decide in the jury room, this man did some beautiful things when it came to making music,"" according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
Bonjean went on to add, ""And he should not be stripped of every bit of humanity that he has.""
But in her closing arguments Monday, prosecutor Elizabeth Pozolo slammed the singer, whom she accused of using his fame to sexually exploit minors.
""Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years,"" she said. ""He committed horrible crimes against children. ... All these years later, the hidden side of Robert Kelly has come out.""

"R. Kelly convicted on many child porn counts, acquitted of trial fixing","By MICHAEL TARM and JOEY CAPPELLETTI
CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography and sex abuse charges in his hometown of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement.
But the jury acquitted him on a fourth pornography count as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008. He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges.
His two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges.
Jurors, who deliberated for 11 hours over two days, wrote several questions to the judge on Wednesday, at least one indicating the panelists were grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.
At trial, prosecutors sought to paint a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover child pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Kelly has already been convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
In Chicago, a conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum of five years. Judges can order that defendants sentenced earlier in separate cases serve their new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences.
During closing arguments Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors.
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said of the prosecution’s case.
The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days. Co-defendant McDavid, who was on the stand for three days, may have damaged Kelly’s hopes for acquittal by saying that he now doubts Kelly was truthful when he denied abusing anyone after hearing the superstar’s accusers testify.
In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Four Kelly accusers testified, all referred to by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify.
Sitting nearby in a suit and face mask, Kelly often averted his eyes and looked down as his accusers spoke.
Some dozen die-hard Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Jane, 37, was the government’s star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents wouldn’t testify.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial.
On the witness stand for two days at the end of August, Jane paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue when she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her aged 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify. At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane said she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video, saying part of her reason for lying was that she cared for Kelly and didn’t want to get him into trouble.
Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 — the age of consent in Illinois — when Kelly began pursing her for sex.
Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster,” saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray.
“Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,” she said in her opening statement.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so journalists and spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. At Kelly’s Chicago home later that year, Pauline described her shock when she said she first walked in on Kelly and a naked Jane. She said Kelly told her that everyone has secrets. “This is our secret,” she testified he said.
Pauline told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ’em. Period.”

O cantor R. Kelly foi condenado nesta quarta-feira (14) por uma corte federal dos EUA em Chicago por produzir vídeos com material pornográfico infantil e abusar sexualmente de menores. A sentença
Ele já havia sido condenado a 30 anos por outros crimes sexuais, e a nova sentença vai aumentar o tempo de prisão - o período ainda não foi definido.
A principal prova da nova condenação era um vídeo que mostrava o cantor urinando em uma garota de 14 anos. A vítima foi uma das testemunhas.
Foram apresentados dois outros vídeos de R. Kelly abusando de mulheres menores de idade. Outras mulheres também testemunharam contra o cantor e relataram abusos sexuais quando eram menores.
O cantor não foi ao tribunal nesta quarta, mas sua advogada Jennifer Bonjean, disse que ele era uma '""vítima de extorsão e exploração financeira"".
Condenação anterior
Ele foi condenado em junho de 2022 a 30 anos de prisão por chefiar durante décadas uma rede de exploração sexual de mulheres e adolescentes.
Ainda na sessão desta quarta, foram ouvidos os depoimentos de diversos acusadores, que detalharam as maneiras como foram vítimas do cantor.
LEIA TAMBÉM
Kelly, que já foi um dos mais populares do R&B nos Estados Unidos pode receber mais décadas à sua sentença, caso seja condenado em outro julgamento federal em Chicago por pornografia infantil e obstrução, previsto para o dia 15 de agosto.
Ele ainda enfrenta acusações estaduais em Illinois e Minnesota.
Ele já tinha evitado uma condenação em 2008, quando foi considerado inocente de 14 crimes em julgamento sobre pornografia infantil.

Nascido Robert Sylvester Kelly, o cantor enfrentava uma acusação de crime organizado e oito violações da Lei Mann, que proíbe o transporte de pessoas através dos limites estaduais para fazer sexo. Ele negava todas as acusações.
Procuradores federais acusavam o cantor de comandar um séquito de empresários, seguranças e outros que recrutavam mulheres e meninas para ele fazer sexo e abusar, além de produzir pornografia, inclusive infantil.

But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. At Kelly’s Chicago home later that year, Pauline described her shock when she said she first walked in on Kelly and a naked Jane.

Pauline told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.

R Kelly döms för sexuella övergrepp och barnpornografibrott,"Du vet väl att du kan skapa ett gratiskonto på DN? Som inloggad kan du ta del av flera smarta funktioner.
Beskedet kom på onsdagseftermiddagen, lokal tid i Chicago, efter att juryn överlagt i två dagar.
R'n'b-sångaren R Kelly, egentligen Robert Kelly, döms för sexuella övergrepp på minderårig, i ett fall som prövades redan 2008.
Det påstådda offret vittnade aldrig då och R Kelly friades mycket på grund av detta. Men kvinnan, som nu är 37 år, vittnade nu som en central gestalt i den nya rättegången. Hon pekade bland annat ut sig själv i en sexvideo – som spelades in då hon var 14.
– Jag skyddade honom. Jag ville inte att den personen skulle vara jag. Jag skämdes, sade hon.
Två andra män stod också åtalade men friades på alla punkter. En av männen anklagades för att ha konspirerat med R Kelly och obstruerat rättegången 2008. Den andre, en av Kellys medarbetare sedan lång tid tillbaka, friades från anklagelser om att ha tagit emot barnpornografi, skriver The Guardian.
Åklagaren Elizabeth Pozolo kallade i sin slutplädering R Kelly för ”ett rovdjur” och menade att han dolt sina mörka sidor under lång tid.
Kvinnan vars vittnesmål ligger till grund för rättegången berättade att R Kelly haft sex med henne ”hundratals gånger” innan hon fyllt 18 år. När hennes föräldrar fick reda på förhållandet under tidigt 2000-tal och konfronterade artisten föll han på knä och bad om deras förlåtelse.
R Kellys försvarsadvokat Jennifer Bonjean vädjade till juryn att inte köpa åklagarens bild av honom. Hon framförde argumentet att Kelly på sätt och vis har ett ”svagt intellekt” och varit lätt för andra att påverka.
R Kelly fälldes förra året på nio åtalspunkter i ett annat mål i en federal domstol i New York. Straffet fastställdes i juni i år till 30 års fängelse. Han ansågs ha utnyttjat sitt kändisskap för att locka till sig kvinnor och minderåriga flickor som han sedan förgripit sig på.
En dom för barnpornografibrott innebär minst tio års fängelse i Chicago. Exakt hur långt straff Kelly döms till är ännu oklart.",2022-09-14T21:46:24Z,https://www.dn.se,Dagens Nyheter

Kelly and two co-defendants in the R&B singer’s trial on federal charges of trial-fixing, child pornography and enticing minors for sex, with jury deliberations to follow.

A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography and sex abuse charges in his hometown of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement.
But the jury acquitted him on a fourth pornography count as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008. He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges.
His two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges.
Jurors wrote several questions to the judge on Wednesday, at least one indicating the panelists were grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.
At trial, prosecutors sought to paint a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover child pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Kelly faced 13 counts. A conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum of five years. Judges can order that defendants sentenced earlier in separate cases serve their new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences.
During closing arguments Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors.
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said of the prosecution’s case.
The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days. Co-defendant McDavid, who was on the stand for three days, may have damaged Kelly’s hopes for acquittal by saying that he now doubts Kelly was truthful when he denied abusing anyone after hearing the superstar’s accusers testify.
In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Four Kelly accusers testified, all referred to by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify.
Sitting nearby in a suit and face mask, Kelly often averted his eyes and looked down as his accusers spoke.
Some dozen die-hard Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Jane, 37, was the government’s star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents wouldn’t testify.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial.
On the witness stand for two days at the end of August, Jane paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue when she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her aged 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify. At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane said she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video, saying part of her reason for lying was that she cared for Kelly and didn’t want to get him into trouble.
Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 — the age of consent in Illinois — when Kelly began pursing her for sex.
Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster,” saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray.
“Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,” she said in her opening statement.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so journalists and spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.

R. Kelly schuldig bevonden in misbruikzaak Chicago,"De jury heeft R. Kelly schuldig bevonden aan drie aanklachten van kinderporno. De zanger werd in Chicago verdacht van dertien vergrijpen, waaronder het produceren van kinderporno, het verleiden van minderjarigen tot seks en het belemmeren van de rechtsgang. Hij is niet schuldig aan de laatstgenoemde aanklacht. Ook zijn twee werknemers die daarvan werden beschuldigd vrijgesproken.
De zaak in Chicago volgt veertien jaar na een eerder proces tegen de zanger in de staat Illinois. Ook toen werd hij beschuldigd van seksueel wangedrag tegenover minderjarige vrouwen, maar werd hij uiteindelijk vrijgesproken. Officieren van justitie in Chicago beweerden nu dat Kelly en twee van zijn voormalige werknemers de uitkomst van de zaak probeerden te manipuleren door getuigen en slachtoffers om te kopen. De 55-jarige zanger en zijn werknemers beweren zich hier niet schuldig aan te hebben gemaakt.
Kelly wordt al sinds de jaren negentig beschuldigd van (kinder)misbruik. Zelf heeft hij altijd gezegd onschuldig te zijn. De zanger, die sinds 2019 vastzit, werd eind juni in New York al schuldig bevonden voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken. Hij kreeg toen een celstraf van dertig jaar.",2022-09-14T21:43:30Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen

R. Kelly Found Guilty on Some Charges in Child Porn Trial in Chicago,"Watch : R. Kelly Sentenced to Prison in Sex Trafficking Case
R. Kelly's trial in Chicago has reached a conclusion.
On Sept. 14, the singer (born Robert Kelly) was found guilty on six charges relating to sex crimes and not guilty on seven counts, according to NBC News.
Prior to the verdict, Kelly faced 13 counts in total: four counts of producing child porn, one count of conspiring to receiving child porn, two counts of receiving child porn, five counts of enticing minors for sex and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.
The jury found him guilty of coercing three children into criminal sexual activity as well as producing sexual abuse videos, according to The New York Times. However, he was found not guilty of attempting to obstruct a prior investigation.
Throughout the four-week courtroom proceeding, prosecutors alleged that Kelly had obstructed the law in rigging his previous child porn case, which ultimately ended with his 2008 acquittal. The latest legal battle saw testimonies from four women accusing the R&B artist of sexually abusing them when they were children, including one who identified herself as the person from the video at the center of Kelly's past trial.",2022-09-14T21:38:54Z,https://www.eonline.com,E!

R Kelly verdict: R&B singer found guilty on 6 counts; co-defendants not guilty in Chicago trial,"What did R Kelly do? The former singer is charged with trial-fixing, child pornography and enticing minors for sex.
CHICAGO, Illinois -- The jury has reached a verdict Wednesday in R. Kelly's federal Chicago trial.
The R &B singer was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of enticing a minor.
Kelly's co-defendants, his former business manager Derrel McDavid and former employee Milton Brown, were found not guilty.
This is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.
Attorneys for R Kelly and his co-defendant came to court briefly when the jurors had questions Wednesday. In the courtroom, they reviewed the questions with the Judge.
The jury had a number of questions for attorneys, including one about a piece of evidence, a college application from a Kelly accuser; if there were records for a Westin hotel stay in 1999 and 2000; and clarity on language of whether Kelly ""persuaded, induced, enticed and/or coerced minors.""
The judge said the application was not admitted into evidence.
Prosecutors responded, saying there were no records of those hotel stays.
They're also working to clarify whether the charging documents stated ""or coerced"" or ""and coerced"" minors, meaning they would have to prove that, as well.
Jurors will need to weigh 13 charges against the three defendants as they debate whether R. Kelly will serve more time in federal prison on child pornography charges dating back decades.

The disgraced singer, once a music industry icon, is on trial with two men intertwined with Kelly's career, including his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and former employee, Milton Brown.
""Derrel McDavid is not guilty, and that is the right answer,"" defense attorney Beau Brindley said. ""And we feel very confident that the jury will reach that answer.""
Jurors heard nine hours of closing arguments in the fifth week of this trial. Kelly is accused of creating child pornography, and all three men are accused of trying to hide sex videos of Kelly with minors and silence witnesses during Kelly's Cook County prosecution in 2008.
Jennifer Bonjean, Kelly's attorney, argued Tuesday: ""This man did some beautiful things with his music. And he should not be stripped of every bit of humanity... I ask more importantly and to remember each count counts and take the time you need...Mr. Kelly deserves it no matter what you think of him.""
Federal prosecutors had the final say, arguing that the activities of the three were conspiracy to thwart criminal prosecution.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannice Appenteng told the jury: ""That case was fixed because Kelly, McDavid and others caused Jane and her family to lie to the grand jury.""
She concluded: ""Find Robert Kelly guilty of sexually abusing these young women....Find Mr. McDavid and Mr. Brown guilty for agreeing with Kelly to cover up the videos.""

Bonjean also spoke about the challenges of public opinion, ahead of the trial's start Tuesday.
""I do think it has come into focus how much Mr. Kelly has been prejudiced having a joint trial,"" she said.
Kelly's attorney argued for hours that federal prosecutors did not prove their case and that their evidence is flawed based on testimony from liars and extortionists.

Kelly was already sentenced to 30 years in prison, after he was convicted in a separate case in New York. Now he faces more years in prison in his federal trial in Chicago.
A key witness for the government is a woman who calls herself Jane and identified herself in videos with Kelly when she was 14 years old.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo argued Monday, ""He took advantage of his position, his fame and her youth. He took advantage for his own pleasure.""

Pozolo went on to argue that the three - Kelly, his former business manager and former assistant - conspired to conceal evidence and thwart criminal prosecution in Cook County when the video of Jane became public.
""Kelly and his team did their best to cover up the fact that this R &B star R Kelly is a sexual predator,"" Pozolo said.
RELATED: Nearly $28K taken from R. Kelly's inmate commissary account for restitution in New York conviction
Prosecutor Pozolo concluded her argument, saying, ""Robert Kelly manipulated girls over many years, and he committed horrible crimes against children. And he didn't do it alone.""
Each defendant's attorney made a closing argument, too.
The attorney for Derrel McDavid - Kelly's former business manager - argued those who testified about McDavid's involvement in any conspiracy lied before and during the trial.
""Don't give into guilt by association because that's all the government has,"" Beau Brindley, McDavid's attorney, told jurors.
Additionally, Brindley argued McDavid believed Kelly's goddaughter, who was 14 years old at the time, was not the girl in the sex tape.
""The information he had then is different than what he has now,"" Brindley said.
Mary Judge, the attorney for Kelly's former assistant, Milton Brown, argued that Brown was not part of any conspiracy, saying, ""It proved he was doing his job and that is all it proves.""
ABC7 Legal Analyst Gil Soffer weighed in on when the verdict could come down.
""Well there's an old rule of thumb in a federal courthouse here, and that is one day of deliberations for each day of trial. That would be some number of days. I think it'll be fewer than that ultimately, but they will take the time that they need. I think we're looking at another day,"" he said.",2022-09-14T21:38:45Z,https://abc7.com,KABC-TV

CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury in Chicago convicted R. Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a monthlong trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to the Grammy Award winning singer who was once one of the world’s biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six of the 13 counts against him, with many of the convictions carrying long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count — that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid — who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly’s believability — were acquitted of all charges.

The trial was, in ways, a do-over of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both. Kelly, who shed tears of joy when jurors acquitted him in 2008, gave a thumbs-up sign to spectators after Wednesday’s verdict but otherwise showed little emotion.
Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar.
Asked by reporters later outside court how Kelly felt after the verdict, his lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said: “Mr. Kelly is used to bad news.”
“He’s still got many fights to fight,” she said. “But what he did say is that he had a sense of relief that this particular case was in the past now.”
The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.
And two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly — one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.

Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Chicago-based U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed satisfaction with the verdict. He told reporters that, when you add up the potential punishments on the six guilty counts, Kelly was staring at at least 10 years and up to 90 in prison.
Judge Harry Leinenweber did not set a sentencing date. He could order that Kelly serve whatever sentence he imposes simultaneously with the New York sentence or only after that one is fully served. The latter would, for practical purposes, mean a life sentence.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Some dozen Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.

Bonjean, Kelly’s attorney, told jurors in her closings that the government had relied, in some cases, on liars and and blackmailers as witnesses. She earlier implored jurors not to see Kelly as “the monster” she said prosecutors so badly wanted them to see.
In her closing rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
All four Kelly accusers who testified went by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, didn’t testify, and jurors acquitted Kelly of the one charge related to her.
Four of his six convictions were tied directly to Jane and relied largely on her testimony.
She was the government’s star witness and also pivotal to the trial fixing charge, of which he was acquitted, and which accused him of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial. Three of the child porn charges that Kelly was convicted of Wednesday were related to that video and others depicting Jane.
Jane, 37, said publicly for the first time at the just-ended trial that the girl in the video was her at age 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.

Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify.
Asked on the witness stand how many times Jane and Kelly had sexually abused her before she turned 18, Jane answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. Soon after that, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly recorded the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. She told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.

CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography and sex abuse charges in his hometown of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement.
But the jury acquitted him on a fourth pornography count as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008. He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges.

His two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges.
Jurors, who deliberated for 11 hours over two days, wrote several questions to the judge on Wednesday, at least one indicating the panelists were grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.
At trial, prosecutors sought to paint a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover child pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.

Kelly has already been convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
In Chicago, a conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum of five years. Judges can order that defendants sentenced earlier in separate cases serve their new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences.
During closing arguments Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors.
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said of the prosecution’s case.
The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days. Co-defendant McDavid, who was on the stand for three days, may have damaged Kelly’s hopes for acquittal by saying that he now doubts Kelly was truthful when he denied abusing anyone after hearing the superstar’s accusers testify.

In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Four Kelly accusers testified, all referred to by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify.
Sitting nearby in a suit and face mask, Kelly often averted his eyes and looked down as his accusers spoke.
Some dozen die-hard Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Jane, 37, was the government’s star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents wouldn’t testify.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial.
On the witness stand for two days at the end of August, Jane paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue when she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her aged 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.

Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify. At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane said she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video, saying part of her reason for lying was that she cared for Kelly and didn’t want to get him into trouble.
Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 — the age of consent in Illinois — when Kelly began pursing her for sex.
Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster,” saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray.

“Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,” she said in her opening statement.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so journalists and spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.

At Kelly’s Chicago home later that year, Pauline described her shock when she said she first walked in on Kelly and a naked Jane. She said Kelly told her that everyone has secrets. “This is our secret,” she testified he said.
Pauline told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.

R Kelly convicted of six counts related to child abuse images,"R&B singer R Kelly has been convicted of six out of 13 counts in a trial related to images of child abuse.
The singer was accused in his hometown of Chicago of 13 charges - including producing child abuse images, enticing minors for sex, and rigging his 2008 trial for child sex abuse.
Kelly and Derrel McDavid, the singer's former business manager, were accused of fixing Kelly's 2008 trial on state child porn charges by intimidating and paying off witnesses.
Kelly, full name Robert Sylvester Kelly, was found guilty of luring underage girls to have sex with him, but not guilty on obstruction of justice charges.
Jurors began their deliberations Tuesday after listening to weeks of testimony and watching portions of an explicit video that one of Kelly's accusers, Jane, said depicts her aged 14 with the R&B singer.
Kelly, who is known for his smash hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"" and for sex-infused songs such as ""Bump n' Grind,"" sold millions of albums even after abuse allegations began circulating in the 1990s.
Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries Surviving R. Kelly.
The 55-year-old Kelly has already been convicted in New York of racketeering and sex trafficking and was sentenced in June to 30 years in federal prison.
Based on that alone, he won't be eligible for release until he is around 80 - but these new convictions could add years to his sentence.

CHICAGO — R. Kelly, the fallen R&B star who was once revered as a product of Chicago’s South Side, was found guilty on Wednesday of sex crimes, including producing child sexual abuse imagery and coercing minors into sex acts.
Mr. Kelly, 55, had already been sentenced to 30 years in prison after a jury in Brooklyn convicted him of racketeering and sex trafficking charges last year — the first time Mr. Kelly had been held criminally responsible for allegations related to sexual abuse despite accusations dating back more than three decades. The conviction in Chicago could add years to that prison sentence.
On Wednesday, the 12-person jury in the trial convicted Mr. Kelly of six out of the 13 charges brought against him. He was found guilty of coercing three minors into criminal sexual activity and producing three child sexual abuse videos. Mr. Kelly was acquitted of attempting to obstruct an earlier investigation into his abuse.
The federal trial in Chicago carried echoes of a state trial in 2008, in which a jury acquitted Mr. Kelly on charges of producing child sexual abuse imagery. That trial focused on one videotape, which prosecutors said showed Mr. Kelly sexually abusing and urinating on a girl when she was 14. After finding him not guilty, some jurors told reporters after that trial that the lack of testimony from the young woman — who had denied to a grand jury that she appeared in the video — had been a significant barrier to convicting Mr. Kelly.
During this trial, which started in August, prosecutors removed that barrier. The woman at the center of the 2008 trial testified, identifying herself as the girl who was sexually abused by Mr. Kelly in the video. Prosecutors showed jurors clips from that video and from two others that they described as footage of Mr. Kelly sexually abusing the woman when she was underage.
Much of the testimony in the trial, which was held at Everett M. Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in downtown Chicago, revolved around the events surrounding that first trial.
Prosecutors accused Mr. Kelly of working to obstruct an investigation into his treatment of underage girls in the early 2000s by hiring people to help him recover missing videos of his sexual abuse of children and convincing the woman at the center of the earlier trial to lie on his behalf.
A key development for prosecutors came when that woman decided in 2019 — months after the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly” aired sexual abuse allegations against Mr. Kelly — to cooperate with investigators.
“I no longer wanted to carry his lies,” the woman testified.
The woman testified that Mr. Kelly had persuaded her to falsely deny to a grand jury in 2002 that it was her on the tape, and that she had ever had a sexual relationship with him. Another key witness, Charles Freeman, testified that Mr. Kelly called him in 2001, asking for help recovering some “stolen tapes.” Mr. Freeman said that over a period of several years, he had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Mr. Kelly and his associates as part of an effort to retrieve missing tapes.
Three other women, all of whom were identified by pseudonyms, testified in the trial, saying that Mr. Kelly sexually abused them when they were underage. A fifth accuser who had been expected to testify did not appear.
Mr. Kelly declined to testify. (He did not testify in the 2008 trial in Chicago or the one in Brooklyn, either.)
A lawyer representing him, Jennifer Bonjean, argued in court that the prosecution of Mr. Kelly was the outcome of a rush to judgment during the #MeToo movement, describing him as a “victim of extortion and financial exploitation.” She sought to cast doubt on the women’s stories and to portray them as testifying for money and self-protection, highlighting the fact that the woman at the center of the 2008 trial had an immunity deal with prosecutors that protects her from perjury charges from lying to the grand jury at the time.
The woman acknowledged that she had an immunity deal, and that she had lied years ago, but insisted that she was telling the truth now. The jury apparently believed her.",2022-09-14T21:35:35Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times

If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors.
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said.
In her rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors to remember the girls and women who have accused Kelly of abuse.
“When you are in the quiet of the jury room, consider the evidence in light of who is at the center of this case. Kelly’s victims: Jane, Nia, Pauline, Tracy and Brittany,” Appenteng said, referring to five Kelly accusers named in charging documents by pseudonyms or their first names.
As Kelly’s fame boomed in the mid-1990s, Appenteng said, his inner circle increasingly focused on doing what the performer born Robert Sylvester Kelly wanted.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Kelly, 55, was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York in June and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Bonjean described Kelly as a flawed genius who has been functionally illiterate since childhood and was ill-equipped to navigate his celebrity and growing wealth. She said that he was abused as a child also deeply affected him.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct circulated in the 1990s.

R. Kelly Found Guilty in Federal Child Pornography Case,"The federal trial of R. Kelly on child pornography and obstruction charges ended today after the jury found Kelly guilty on three of four child pornography counts for videotaping himself having sex with his 14-year-old goddaughter. He was also found guilty on three of five counts of enticement of a minor. Kelly was found not guilty on charges of conspiring to receive child pornography and charges to conspire to obstruct justice in his 2002 Cook County case. The jurors deliberated for reportedly just under 11 hours.
Proceedings in Kelly’s federal trial have been underway since August. The charges centered on Kelly’s actions during his 2008 trial for child pornography—charges for which he was acquitted after the 14-year-old victim refused to testify. The now-37-year-old woman said Kelly coached her on what to say before the grand jury in 2008, flew her and her parents out of the country to make them unavailable to investigators and media, and continued to abuse her after he was acquitted.
In June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on a separate federal sex crimes case; he was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking in September 2021 in the Eastern District of New York. He sued the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn shortly after his sentencing, claiming he was punitively placed under suicide watch despite having no thoughts of self-harm. Kelly currently also faces state-level charges in Illinois and Minnesota.

"R. Kelly convicted of multiple child pornography and enticement charges, acquitted on others, report says","(CNN) R. Kelly was convicted of multiple child pornography charges at a Chicago federal trial and acquitted on others, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Kelly was convicted on three of four child pornography counts and acquitted on charges that he conspired to obstruct justice at his 2008 trial which stemmed from a 2002 state case.
He was also found guilty on three of five counts of enticement of a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity.
Jennifer Bonjean, Kelly's attorney, said her client had a ""sense of relief"" that this case is now behind him, and felt that prosecutors had overblown their case against him. Bonjean said she is considering filing an appeal.
""There was a mixed verdict, but we won more counts than we lost,"" Bonjean said outside court following the verdict. ""If this jury concluded that he was guilty on the first three counts, would they care enough to consider the evidence on the rest? And they demonstrated that they did. They did their job. They looked at each count separately.""

R. Kelly found guilty in federal kid porn trial,"Disgraced R&B star R. Kelly was convicted Wednesday on federal child pornography charges following a monthlong trial in Chicago.
It comes on top of a 30-year prison sentence handed to the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer in June after he was found guilty of sex-trafficking and racketeering in a separate federal case in Brooklyn.
Jurors in the Chicago trial began deliberating on Tuesday afternoon.
Kelly, 55, was accused of videotaping himself having sex with underage girls, as well as of rigging his 2008 state trial on child porn charges, for which he was acquitted.
He was convicted on six out of the 13 counts he faced, according to CBS Chicago.
Co-defendant Derrell McDavid, Kelly’s former business manager, was also charged with conspiring to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial, as well as two counts of receiving child porn. Another co-defendant, Kelly associate Milton Brown, faced a count of conspiring to receive child porn. Both were found not guilty on all counts, the outlet said.
Prosecutors, during the trial, said the “Ignition” singer was “a sexual predator” who had used his fame to prey on underage girls and record the abuse on video.

“Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years,” Assistant US Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo told the jurors, using the fallen star’s full name. “He committed horrible crimes against children. … All these years later, the hidden side of Robert Kelly has come out.”
The evidence against Kelly included graphic videos of the Grammy-winner abusing his then-14-year-old goddaughter — who previously gave damning testimony against him under the name “Jane.”
“That child, who had no prior sexual experiences in her life, was forced to lay on that floor while that man sitting right over there urinated on her,” Pozolo said in her closing argument. “That degrading act is forever captured on that video. That abuse is forever memorialized.”
Now 37, Jane testified that Kelly had sex with her “innumerable times,” sometimes along with other teenage girls that he had asked her to recruit.

Defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean specifically called out Kelly’s ex-girlfriend Lisa Van Allen, who testified she stole a sex tape from the singer — as well as one of his former associates, Charles Freeman, who asked him for $1 million to return an incriminating sex tape. Both testified with immunity.
“They came in here to tell the government’s version of the truth,” Bonjean said during her closing argument Tuesday.

R. Kelly found guilty on 6 counts of child pornography in federal trial,"CHICAGO — An Illinois federal jury has found disgraced singer R. Kelly guilty on six counts of sexual exploitation and enticement of a minor in a case stemming from the complaints of several women who alleged that he lured them into sex acts while they were underage and accusations that Kelly conspired to intimidate and bribe witnesses and cover up evidence of that abuse in a previous criminal trial against him.
The decision came on the second day of deliberations and came one year after Kelly was convicted in New York on charges of federal racketeering and sex trafficking. He is serving a 30-year prison sentence in that case.
Kelly had faced 13 counts, including charges of sexual exploitation of a minor, receipt of child pornography, enticement of a minor to engage in unlawful sexual conduct, conspiring to obstruct justice and conspiring to receive child pornography. He was acquitted on seven counts, including all of the charges related to conspiracy.
Kelly had been accused by prosecutors of engaging in sex acts with five minors and recording some of the abuse on multiple videos.
During the trial, spread across five weeks, jurors heard from several of Kelly’s alleged victims who all testified that they were underage when Kelly began sexually abusing them.
Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was tried alongside two co-defendants, former business manager Derrel McDavid and associate Milton “June” Brown. McDavid and Brown were both found not guilty on all charges.
Both men were accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the outcome of the singer’s 2008 criminal trial in Cook County, which involved a video recording of Kelly allegedly sexually abusing a minor, according to the federal charges against them.
Prosecutors centered their case around a star witness, identified by the pseudonym Jane in court, who identified herself as the person in a 26-minute videotape sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times in 2002 that allegedly showed Kelly performing sex acts with an underage girl. NBC News has not viewed the videotape. Parts of it and several other recordings, purportedly depicting Kelly engaged in sex acts with minors, were played during the trial as the prosecution presented its case.
Kelly was previously tried in Cook County on child pornography charges relating to the same video and was acquitted. Jane refused to testify at that trial.
In emotional testimony, Jane, now 37, said the singer began having sex with her when she was 15 and he was in his 30s and continued to do so “hundreds” of times before she turned 18. She also testified that he exerted an intense psychological grip on her that caused her to isolate herself from her parents and keep the relationship secret to remain “loyal” to him.
She testified that she decided to come forward a few years ago because she “became exhausted with living with his lies.”
Kelly was convicted Wednesday on three of the four charges of sexual exploitation of a minor related to Jane.
Three other alleged victims also testified that Kelly manipulated and sexually abused them for years while they were underage.
Prosecution witnesses also testified that Kelly and his co-defendants paid and intimidated several people in an attempt to retrieve the video recording of his alleged assault of Jane.
Federal prosecutors told jurors during closing arguments that Kelly had committed “horrible crimes against children” and then, with help from his business partners, tried to cover up his actions because he knew they would be “completely damning.”
They also argued that Kelly “took advantage of Jane’s youth” for his own “sick pleasure” and that the jury must look at the case using her as “a base and guide.”
“She was brave enough to come forward after all these years to tell you what happened,” attorney Elizabeth Pozolo told jurors Monday.
Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, did not testify during the trial. His attorney Jennifer Bonjean argued that the government’s witnesses were not credible and called many “liars’’ and opportunists. She even likened the testimony of two of the witnesses to “cockroaches” that spoil the “entire soup” during her closing arguments.
She implored jurors Tuesday to put aside their prior knowledge of Kelly when deliberating and focus only on the evidence presented during this trial.
The trial took place in Kelly’s hometown, and several supporters and family members showed up hours before the trial started each day to secure a spot in the courtroom. Throughout the trial, some prayed with Bibles and rosaries, and on the last day of closing arguments some wore white in a show of solidarity with the disgraced singer. Several people prayed together as they waited, asking “an angel to come through the courtroom” to help Kelly.",2022-09-14T21:25:22Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
"R. Kelly convicted on federal child porn charges, acquitted of trial fixing","CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography and sex abuse charges in his hometown of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography but was acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008.
But the jury acquitted him on a fourth pornography count as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008. He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges.
His two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges.
Jurors wrote several questions to the judge on Wednesday, at least one indicating the panelists were grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.
At trial, prosecutors sought to paint a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover child pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Kelly faced 13 counts. A conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum of five years. Judges can order that defendants sentenced earlier in separate cases serve their new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences.
During closing arguments Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors.
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said.
The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days. Co-defendant McDavid, who was on the stand for three days, may have damaged Kelly’s hopes for acquittal by saying that he now doubts Kelly was truthful when he denied abusing anyone after hearing the superstar’s accusers testify.
In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Four Kelly accusers testified, all referred to by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify.
Sitting nearby in a suit and face mask, Kelly often averted his eyes and looked down as his accusers spoke.
Some dozen die-hard Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Jane, 37, was the government’s star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents wouldn’t testify.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial.
On the witness stand for two days at the end of August, Jane paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue when she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her aged 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify. At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane said she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video, saying part of her reason for lying was that she cared for Kelly and didn’t want to get him into trouble.
Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 — the age of consent in Illinois — when Kelly began pursing her for sex.
Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster,” saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray.
“Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,” she said in her opening statement.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so journalists and spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. At Kelly’s Chicago home later that year, Pauline described her shock when she said she first walked in on Kelly and a naked Jane. She said Kelly told her that everyone has secrets. “This is our secret,” she testified he said.
Pauline told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ’em. Period.”",2022-09-14T20:33:07Z,https://www.wcia.com,wcia.com
R. Kelly Found Guilty in Federal Child Pornography Case,"A Chicago federal jury found R. Kelly guilty on Wednesday of three counts of child pornography for filming himself sexually abusing his then-14-year-old goddaughter.
According to the Chicago Tribune, of the indictment’s 13 charges, Kelly was also found guilty of three counts of child sex trafficking through coercion and enticement. He was acquitted on charges that he conspired to obstruct justice in his 2002 Cook County case. Additionally, he was acquitted on two counts of receiving child pornography and one count of conspiring to receive child pornography.
There were two co-defendants in the proceedings, former employees Milton “June” Brown and Derrel McDavid. Both were acquitted of all charges, including that they had conspired to receive child pornography, and that McDavid conspired to obstruct justice.
The verdict follows the testimony of Kelly’s goddaughter, who went by the pseudonym Jane. Three other women testified that Kelly had also recorded and kept tapes of himself sexually abusing them when they were underage, while McDavid testified that he was unaware of the fact that they were being filmed.
Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June after a jury declared him guilty of racketeering related to the sexual exploitation of children, kidnapping, and forced labor. He was also charged with eight counts of violating the Mann Act in a separate federal case in New York. Kelly is still facing more sex crime charges in Minnesota.

R.Kelly found guilty on multiple counts in sex trial,"Disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly, who is serving a 30-year sentence for sex offenses, was found guilty of child pornography and other charges on Wednesday after a month-long trial in his hometown of Chicago.
Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was convicted of three counts of producing child pornography and three counts of enticement of a minor, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Kelly, a three-time Grammy Award-winner, was acquitted by a federal jury of seven other counts including charges that he obstructed justice in a previous trial, the newspaper said.
Kelly and two ex-associates had been accused of rigging the singer's 2008 child pornography trial in which a jury delivered a verdict of not guilty.
Kelly's former manager, Derrel McDavid, and an ex-employee, Milton ""June"" Brown, were tried alongside the singer in the latest trial and were also acquitted of obstruction charges.
The 12-person jury took around 11 hours over two days to deliver the verdicts, which could add additional decades in prison to the 30 years Kelly is already serving.
A minor victim declined to testify in the 2008 trial because of alleged threats and bribes, but the now 37-year-old woman took the witness stand this time.
Excerpts from videos depicting sexual abuse by Kelly of girls as young as 14 were played for the jury during the trial.
Kelly was convicted in New York in September of last year of recruiting teenagers and women for sex.
The ""I Believe I Can Fly"" artist was found guilty of eight charges of sex trafficking and one count of racketeering in the New York case.
- Faces further charges -
Kelly's conviction in New York was widely seen as a milestone for the #MeToo movement: It was the first major sex abuse trial where the majority of the accusers were Black women.
It was also the first time Kelly faced criminal consequences for the abuse he was rumored for decades to have inflicted on women and children.
Kelly also faces prosecution in two other state jurisdictions.
In the New York case, his accusers described events that often mirrored one another.
Many of the alleged victims said they had met the singer at concerts or mall performances and were then handed slips of paper with Kelly's contact details by members of his entourage.
Several said they were told he could bolster their music industry aspirations.
But prosecutors argued all were instead ""indoctrinated"" into Kelly's world -- groomed for sex at his whim and kept in line by ""coercive means of control,"" including isolation and cruel disciplinary measures.
Core to the New York case was Kelly's relationship with the late singer Aaliyah.
Kelly wrote and produced her first album -- ""Age Ain't Nothin' But A Number"" -- before illegally marrying her when she was just 15 because he feared he had impregnated her.
His former manager admitted in court to bribing a worker to obtain fake identification allowing the union, which was later annulled...AFP",2022-09-14T19:00:00Z,https://www.thenews.com.pk,The News International

Jurors have reached a verdict at the trial of R. Kelly, who is accused in his hometown of Chicago of 13 charges including producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex and rigging his 2008 child pornography trial.
The prosecutor’s office said Wednesday that the verdict will be announced soon.
The verdict comes on the second day of deliberations in the case and after numerous questions from the jury.
Among the questions was at least one indicating the panelists may have grappled with some of the case's legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly's lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.
Other questions centered on evidence, or a lack thereof, with the judge ultimately informing them that no such evidence was admitted in the trial.
Jurors are sorting through a month of evidence and arguments on charges accusing the singer of producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex and rigging his 2008 child porn trial.
They must consider 13 separate counts, some involving complex law and assessments of which witnesses were more believable. They began deliberating Tuesday after Judge Harry Leinenweber gave them jury instructions, including explicit descriptions of what constitutes sexual abuse.
Before they withdrew Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean sounded indignant, likening government testimony and evidence to a cockroach and the government’s case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors. She said of the prosecution’s case: “There are just too many cockroaches.”
Kelly, 55, was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison during a separate federal trial in New York where he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking.
In her rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors to remember the girls and women Kelly allegedly abused.
“When you are in the quiet of the jury room, consider the evidence in light of who is at the center of this case. Kelly’s victims: Jane, Nia, Pauline, Tracy and Brittany,” Appenteng said, referring to five Kelly accusers named in charging documents by their pseudonyms or first names.
She said as Kelly’s fame boomed in the mid-1990s, his inner circle increasingly geared everything they did to what Kelly wanted.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Bonjean described Kelly as a flawed genius who has been functional illiterate since childhood and was ill-equipped to navigate his celebrity and expanding wealth. She said having been abused as a child also deeply affected him.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct circulated in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”

The jury will be considering more than just Kelly's fate as well. The singer's former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and former employee, Milton Brown are also on trial for their involvement. They stand accused of fixing Kelly’s 2008 trial for state child porn charges by allegedly intimidating and paying off witnesses.
""This man did some beautiful things with his music. And he should not be stripped of every bit of humanity,"" Kelly's defense attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, argued on Tuesday. ""I ask more importantly and to remember each count counts and take the time you need...Mr. Kelly deserves it no matter what you think of him.""
""He took advantage of his position, his fame, and her youth,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo argued on Monday. ""He took advantage for his own pleasure.""
Kelly has already been sentenced to 30 years in prison for a separate case in New York in which he was found guilty.

Jurors returned to the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse on Wednesday morning to continue deliberations in the trial of R. Kelly and two former associates on charges they conspired to cover up Kelly’s sexual abuse for years.
The panel was sent back at 1 p.m. Tuesday after closing arguments, and deliberated for less than four hours before being sent home without reaching a verdict.

Kelly, 55, is facing a 13-count indictment charging him with 13 counts of producing and receiving child pornography, enticing minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Also charged are former Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, who are accused in an alleged scheme to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and to hide years of alleged sexual abuse.

This is the third time Kelly has been waiting on a jury to decide his fate. A federal jury in Brooklyn found him guilty of racketeering conspiracy last year after nine hours of deliberating. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison on that conviction.
And a Cook County jury in 2008 acquitted him on child pornography charges after deliberating for about 7 1/2 hours. That trial has played a significant role in Kelly’s current federal case -- prosecutors have said he and his associates “scammed” that jury by pressuring the victim, his teenage goddaughter “Jane,” not to cooperate with authorities.
Before deliberations began Tuesday, Kelly’s attorney urged the jury in her closing argument to put aside any preconceived notions they may have about the singer and see “the humanity” in him when deliberating charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice.
Jennifer Bonjean began her final presentation to the jury by asking them to treat Kelly like a “John Doe,” as some of his accusers have been, not what they may have heard about him in the news or at the office.
“We are asking really the impossible of you, right? To put that all aside and decide this case based only on what was put into evidence,” Bonjean said.
Bonjean spent a lot of her nearly two-hour argument talking about Kelly’s relationship with Jane and her family, which continued far beyond her alleged abuse as a minor and was approved by her parents.
Jane’s parents lied to the grand jury about her sexual relationship with the singer because “they didn’t care,” Bonjean said. “She was 17 and they didn’t care … They condoned it.”
Bonjean also painted many of the women who accused Kelly of sexual misdeeds as liars and opportunists, particularly Lisa Van Allen, who /she/ called an extortionist and a thief.

In her rebuttal argument Tuesday, however, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannice Appenteng said the evidence was clear that Kelly was a serial sexual predator and that his co-defendants made the decision to help him hide it to keep his career intact and keep lining their own pockets.
“What R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” Appenteng said. “And what the people around him wanted … they wanted to help their boss, including helping him get away with it.”
Attorneys for Brown, meanwhile, have argued that he was just a low-level employee who had no idea what his boss was really up to. And McDavid, during a marathon 14-hour testimony in his own defense, said he genuinely believed Kelly was innocent of wrongdoing.
Prosecutors in their closing arguments said McDavid’s 14-hour testimony on his own behalf was just an “incredible, after-the-fact, concocted story,” particularly his claims that he was just following the direction of Kelly’s criminal defense attorney, Edward Genson, his entertainment lawyer Gerald Margolis, and private detective Jack Palladino — all of whom are deceased.
“Do not let him hide behind the supposed words of three dead men,” Appenteng said. “The time has come. Hold him accountable.”

R. Kelly, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for racketeering and sex trafficking earlier this year, is standing trial in Chicago, in the next chapter of prosecutors’ efforts to hold him criminally responsible for allegations of sexual abuse dating back more than three decades.
The trial, in the city Kelly long called home, carries echoes from his first courtroom spectacle there in 2008, in which a jury acquitted him of producing child sexual abuse imagery.
This time, federal prosecutors are seeking to hold Kelly and his associates accountable for working to stymie the earlier trial. They are accusing Kelly and a former employee who is also on trial, Derrel McDavid, of arranging hush money payments and seeking to conceal evidence that would have aided prosecutors when they were investigating the singer in the early 2000s.

Kelly, 55, is facing charges that he coerced five minors into sex acts and several charges related to producing child sexual abuse imagery. He and McDavid are also facing charges of receiving child sexual abuse imagery, during what prosecutors have described as a scheme to recover missing tapes of Kelly having sex with minors.
A third man — another former employee of Kelly’s, Milton Brown — is facing a related charge. All three men have pleaded not guilty.
The trial will be an emotional moment for many in Chicago who have witnessed Kelly’s rise from a child of the city to a pop and R&B star, then his fall after he was accused of luring underage girls into his orbit.
“Chicago has always struggled with this because he is local, and we tend to go up for our locals,” said Mikki Kendall, a writer who grew up in the city and recalled, in the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” seeing the adult singer approaching teenage girls at a local McDonald’s. “There are people who are going to be very upset and will again try to insist that the girls are at fault, and there are going to be people — and I am one of them — who are going to say 59,000 times: He is a grown man preying on very young women and children.”

The first public disclosure of abuse allegations came in a 1996 lawsuit, and a steady drip of legal claims and articles followed over the next two decades. The renewed effort to prosecute Kelly came in 2019, after the Lifetime documentary broadcast accounts of women who described being abused and controlled by him, oftentimes when they were teenagers.
One year ago, Kelly stood trial in New York, where a jury found him guilty of leading a decadeslong scheme to recruit women and underage girls for sex. He started serving his 30-year prison term in Brooklyn before he was transferred to a federal prison in Chicago for the current trial.
Over the trial, which started in August, prosecutors have asserted that Kelly had repeatedly sexually abused minors and that he did so with the protection of his associates. They showed jurors clips from three videos that they say show Kelly sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl — the same one at the center of the 2008 trial. (The defense has argued that the videos are of consenting adults.)
During closing arguments Monday, Elizabeth Pozolo, one of the prosecutors, pointed to testimony that Kelly and his associates had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to recover the videotapes, arguing that they would not have gone to such lengths if the tapes had been of consenting adults.

“Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years, he committed horrible crimes against children, and he didn’t do it alone,” Pozolo said. “All these years later, the hidden side of Robert Kelly has come to light.”
A lawyer for Kelly, Jennifer Bonjean, has argued that Kelly’s accusers and the key witnesses called by the prosecution came out against her client to profit financially or to gain protection from perjury and others charges. In her closing argument Tuesday, she sought to persuade the jury that inconsistencies in those witnesses’ accounts are reason enough to acquit Kelly.
“When you find a cockroach in the soup, you don’t just pull out the cockroach; you throw out the whole soup,” she said. “There are too many cockroaches in the testimony of many of these witnesses.”
Lawyers for McDavid have argued that he was just doing his job when he hired lawyers to handle settlements related to Kelly’s sex tapes — which, they argued, McDavid believed to involve adults, not minors. And lawyers for Brown described their client as an “assistant” and an “errand boy” for Kelly who was not aware of his behavior.
What happened in 2008?
The 2008 trial was a result of a 2002 grand jury indictment of Kelly on 21 counts of child pornography, which were later reduced to 14. The case took years to go to a jury. During that time, the singer debuted some of the biggest hits of his career, including “Ignition” and “Step in the Name of Love.”
The trial revolved around a 27-minute tape that prosecutors said showed Kelly having a sex with a teenage girl and urinating on her. The case hinged on whether the jury was convinced that the people in the tape were who the prosecutors said they were. Kelly and the young woman denied they were the ones on the tape, and neither testified in the trial.

A jury found Kelly not guilty on all charges, and after the verdict was released, jurors said the young woman’s refusal to testify was a significant barrier to convicting him.
How is that relevant to the current trial?
A portion of the trial has focused on charges that Kelly and his associate, David, conspired to obstruct the previous investigation by paying off people with knowledge of Kelly’s abuse and seeking to suppress evidence.
Prosecutors accuse Kelly of persuading the minor in the tape to deny to a grand jury in the early 2000s that she had a sexual relationship with Kelly and that it was her in the 27-minute video. According to the federal indictment, Kelly and McDavid arranged payments and bought gifts for the minor and her parents over a roughly 15-year period to prevent them from speaking to law enforcement about the abuse.
These hush money payments were part of a broader effort, prosecutors say, to hide evidence of Kelly’s sexual abuse from investigators.
In 2001, after state officials started investigating whether Kelly had been abusing the child at the center of the 2008 trial, Kelly and his associates realized that several videotapes of the singer sexually abusing her had gone missing, according to the indictment in the case. After that realization, Kelly and McDavid started a multiyear effort to reclaim those videos, hiring a man named Charles Freeman, who testified in the trial that he was hired to return tapes without knowing exactly what was on them.
Around the time of the first trial in Chicago, Freeman said, he had planned a news conference about the existence of footage of Kelly having sex with minors. According to the indictment, Kelly, McDavid and others paid Freeman $170,000 to cancel it.

The charges of receiving child sexual abuse imagery relate to the effort to recover several missing videos of Kelly engaging in sex acts with the person at the center of the 2008 trial.
Who has testified?
The jury heard from the woman whose testimony in 2008 was a missing piece of evidence in the case. Testifying under a pseudonym, the woman told the jury that Kelly, who had been her godfather, started sexually abusing her when she was 14 years old.
She said that in 2002, after law enforcement officials had obtained a videotape of the abuse, Kelly sent her and her parents out of the country to make them inaccessible to investigators. When they returned to Chicago, the woman testified, Kelly urged her to deny to a grand jury that it was her on the tape and paid for a lawyer to accompany her. She said that she had falsely told the grand jury that it was not her on the videotape and that she was not sexually involved with Kelly. The woman also said that she gave Kelly’s lawyers a necklace of hers that could be seen on the videotape.
But in recent years, the woman began cooperating with investigators.
“I no longer wanted to carry his lies,” she testified.
In cross-examination, Bonjean pointed to the woman’s immunity deal with prosecutors, which prevents her from being charged with perjury, as a reason the jury should doubt her account.
Three other women, who were also identified by pseudonyms, testified that Kelly sexually abused them when they were underage.

The jury has heard from several other witnesses, including a clinical psychologist who focuses on the grooming of minors and Daniel Everett, a retired Chicago police detective who had investigated the infamous videotape in the early 2000s and said that the location at which it had been shot matched Kelly’s home in Chicago.
Lawyers for the defendants called several witnesses who pointed to inconsistencies in the accusers’ accounts of events, including one woman’s claim that she was 16 when Kelly first sexually abused her, which conflicts with a lawsuit she filed that listed her as 17 at that time.
McDavid was the only defendant who testified on his own behalf. He denied knowing that there was an underage girl on the sex tapes that he was helping Kelly recover but said that he was now “embarrassed” and “sad” after learning “a lot of things that I had no idea about in 2008.”
How does the trial in Chicago differ from the one in Brooklyn?
The trials have been similar in that the centerpiece of the prosecutors’ case is testimony from people who say Kelly recruited them for sex, but the legal approaches are different.
In Brooklyn, Kelly was convicted of one count of racketeering based on allegations that he was the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that had carried out acts of bribery, kidnapping and forced labor. He was also convicted of eight counts of violating the Mann Act, a sex trafficking statute.
In the trial that started in August, which is in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the charges are just as complex. Kelly faces five counts of coercing a minor into criminal sexual activity; four counts of doing so for the purpose of producing a video of the conduct; two counts of receiving child pornography; one count of conspiring to receive child pornography; and one count of conspiring to obstruct an investigation.

One part of Kelly’s history that was not addressed is his illegal marriage to singer Aaliyah when she was 15 and Kelly was 27. The marriage was central to the case against Kelly in Brooklyn, where a witness testified that Kelly sexually abused Aaliyah when she was only 13 or 14 years old. (Aaliyah died in a 2001 plane crash.)
Kelly’s legal team asked the judge in the Chicago trial to exclude evidence related to the marriage, and that evidence was not introduced.
Is Kelly facing any other criminal charges?
Yes. Kelly still faces sex crime charges in Illinois and Minnesota. After the federal trial in Chicago, those charges will be dealt with next.

Day 2 of R. Kelly's child porn trial,"Michael Tarm And Joey Cappelletti, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) — Jurors were set to begin deliberating for a second day Wednesday at R. Kelly's federal trial in Chicago, sorting through a month of evidence and arguments on charges accusing the singer of producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex and rigging his 2008 child porn trial.
Jurors must consider 13 separate counts, some involving complex law and assessments of which witnesses were more believable. They began deliberating Tuesday after Judge Harry Leinenweber gave them jury instructions, including explicit descriptions of what constitutes sexual abuse.
Before they withdrew Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean sounded indignant, likening government testimony and evidence to a cockroach and the government’s case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,"" said told jurors. She said of the prosecution’s case: “There are just too many cockroaches.”
Kelly, 55, was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison during a separate federal trial in New York where he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking.
In her rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors to remember the girls and women Kelly allegedly abused.
“When you are in the quiet of the jury room, consider the evidence in light of who is at the center of this case. Kelly’s victims: Jane, Nia, Pauline, Tracy and Brittany,” Appenteng said, referring to five Kelly accusers named in charging documents by their pseudonyms or first names.
She said as Kelly's fame boomed in the mid-1990s, his inner circle increasingly geared everything they did to what Kelly wanted.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Bonjean described Kelly as a flawed genius who has been functional illiterate since childhood and was ill-equipped to navigate his celebrity and expanding wealth. She said having been abused as a child also deeply affected him.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct circulated in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly and co-defendant Derrell McDavid, Kelly's ex-business manager, are accused of fixing Kelly's 2008 trial on state child porn charges by intimidating and paying off witnesses.
Kelly faces four counts of producing child porn, one of conspiring to obstruct justice by fixing the 2008 trial, one of conspiring to receive child porn, two of actually receiving it and five of enticing minors for sex.

Jurors in R. Kelly child porn trial reach verdict,"Michael Tarm And Joey Cappelletti, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography charges in his hometown of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography but was acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008.
The decision comes after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, he won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.

"R. Kelly convicted of child porn, enticing girls for sex","Michael Tarm And Joey Cappelletti, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - A federal jury in Chicago convicted R. Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a monthlong trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to the Grammy Award singer who was once one of the world's biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six of the 13 counts against him, with many of the convictions carrying long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count - that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrell McDavid - who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly's believability - were acquitted of all charges.
The trial was, in ways, a do-over of Kelly's 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both. Kelly, who shed tears of joy when jurors acquitted him in 2008, gave a thumbs-up sign to spectators after Wednesday's verdict but otherwise showed little emotion.
Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side to become a superstar.
Asked by reporters later outside court how Kelly felt after the verdict, his lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said: “Mr. Kelly is used to bad news.”
“He's still got many fights to fight,” she said. “But what he did say is that he had a sense of relief that this particular case was in the past now.”
The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won't be eligible for release until he is around 80.
And two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly - one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Chicago-based U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed satisfaction with the verdict. He told reporters that, when you add up the potential punishments on the six guilty counts, Kelly was staring at at least 10 years and up to 90 in prison.
Judge Harry Leinenweber did not set a sentencing date. He could order that Kelly serve whatever sentence he imposes simultaneously with the New York sentence or only after that one is fully served. The latter would, for practical purposes, mean a life sentence.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Some dozen Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Bonjean, Kelly's attorney, told jurors in her closings that the government had relied, in some cases, on liars and and blackmailers as witnesses. She earlier implored jurors not to see Kelly as “the monster” she said prosecutors so badly wanted them to see.
In her closing rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly's inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
All four Kelly accusers who testified went by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, didn't testify, and jurors acquitted Kelly of the one charge related to her.
Four of his six convictions were tied directly to Jane and relied largely on her testimony.
She was the government's star witness and also pivotal to the trial fixing charge, of which he was acquitted, and which accused him of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial. Three of the child porn charges that Kelly was convicted of Wednesday were related to that video and others depicting Jane.
Jane, 37, said publicly for the first time at the just-ended trial that the girl in the video was her at age 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn't testify.
Asked on the witness stand how many times Jane and Kelly had sexually abused her before she turned 18, Jane answered quietly: “Uncountable times. â€¦ Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. Soon after that, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so spectators couldn't see the videos or the jurors' reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly recorded the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. She told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I'm killing 'em. Period.”

He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges. His two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges. Jurors wrote several questions to the judge on Wednesday, at least one indicating the panelists were grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities. One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.

The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said. Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.

R. Kelly found guilty,"CHICAGO — A federal jury in Chicago on Wednesday convicted disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly on child pornography charges for making videotapes of himself sexually abusing his then-14-year-old goddaughter decades ago.
After about 11 hours of deliberation, the jury found Kelly, 55, guilty of three of the first four counts of the indictment, which charged the singer with the sexual exploitation of “Jane” for the purpose of producing child pornography. He was acquitted on a fourth count.
The jury’s decision on the remaining charges in the 13-count indictment were still being read in U.S. District Court Judge Harry Leinenweber’s courtroom.
The jury reached a verdict after deliberation over two days. Each child pornography count carries a mandatory-minimum 10-year prison sentence, with the possibility that they would have to be served consecutively.
Earlier Wednesday the jury had sent out a series of notes to the judge, including one informing the court they were undecided on two counts against two defendants.
The verdict comes 14 years after Kelly’s infamous acquittal on similar charges in Cook County, which were based on a single video of Kelly allegedly abusing Jane in the hot tub room of his former home on West George Street in the late 1990s.
Prosecutors have said Jane lied to a state grand jury investigating that tape, claiming she wasn’t the girl depicted and that she and Kelly had never had a sexual relationship. Her absence at the 2008 trial was the defining factor in the jury’s finding of not guilty.
Prosecutors in Kelly’s current case have alleged her silence was no accident, but the result of a yearslong criminal conspiracy by Kelly and his co-defendants to keep Jane and other minor victims from cooperating with law enforcement and to buy back and cover up incriminating sex videos Kelly had made.
After maintaining a relationship with Kelly for years afterward, Jane began cooperating three years ago with a federal investigation initiated after the airing of the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly was indicted in July 2019 on charges of producing and receiving child pornography, enticing minors for sex and obstruction of justice. Also charged were his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and ex-employee Milton “June” Brown, who were accused of assisting with the cover-up of Kelly’s sexual misconduct.
During the five-week trial, the jury was shown clips from three separate videos allegedly depicting Kelly abusing Jane, including the same tape from his Cook County trial as well as another where he instructed her to refer repeatedly to her “14-year-old” genitalia.
Last month, Jane testified for the first time that not only was it her on the videotapes, but that Kelly had sexually abused her “innumerable” times when she was a minor, at his recording studio, his home, on tour buses and in hotel rooms.
Asked on the witness stand why, after two decades of silence, she finally decided to come forward and speak out, Jane said: “I became exhausted with living with (Kelly’s) lies.”
In her closing argument Tuesday, Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, talked at length about Kelly’s relationship with Jane and her family, which continued far beyond her alleged abuse as a minor and, according to Bonjean, was approved by her parents.
“It is an inconvenient reality for the government,” Bonjean said. “Lives are complex, and for all the fist-pounding and the outrage, that family made a decision that they had to live with at that time.”
Jane’s parents lied to the grand jury about her sexual relationship with the singer because “they didn’t care,” Bonjean said. “She was 17 and they didn’t care. ... They condoned it.”
Bonjean noted that when “Surviving R. Kelly” was coming out, Jane repeatedly reached out to Kelly but he never tried to influence her in any way. “He changed his phone number,” she said. “He goes silent on her. This is the most disinterested person in obstructing that I have ever seen.”
In rebuttal, however, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannice Appenteng said the evidence was clear that Kelly was a serial sexual predator and that his co-defendants made the decision to help him hide it to keep his career intact and keep lining their own pockets.
“What R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” Appenteng said. “And what the people around him wanted ... they wanted to help their boss, including helping him get away with it.”
Appenteng also urged the jury to pay special attention to Jane’s testimony and the videotapes of her abuse.
“You saw how (Kelly) was using her body, flipping her over, throwing her around like she was some rag doll,” Appenteng says. “That’s what this case is about.”
The verdict marked the second criminal conviction for Kelly in the past year. In September 2021, a federal jury in Brooklyn found him guilty of racketeering conspiracy and eight other counts alleging the singer used his organization to lure and trap girls, boys and young women to satisfy his sexually predatory desires.
He was sentenced in June to 30 years in federal prison by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly.

The jury also saw a video of Kelly molesting his goddaughter, who testified that the abuse began in the 1990s when she was a teenager. Kelly and both his co-defendants, Milton “June” Brown and Derrel McDavid, were acquitted on charges they conspired to receive child pornography. Kelly and McDavid were also acquitted on charges they conspired to obstruct justice in an earlier case. The men were accused of trying to bribe and threaten witnesses in the 2008 Illinois case in which Kelly was found not guilty on 14 counts of child pornography. In June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on his conviction in a New York federal court on racketeering and prostitution charges. That trial amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the Grammy-winning hit “I Believe I Can Fly” for two decades. Kelly also faces various state charges in Illinois and Minnesota.

Declararon culpable al cantante R. Kelly de múltiples cargos en un juicio por abuso sexual,"R. Kelly en el Tribunal Penal de Leighton el 17 de septiembre de 2019 en Chicago, Illinois (Photo by Antonio Perez - Pool via Getty Images)
El cantante de R&B R. Kelly fue declarado culpable el miércoles en su último juicio en un tribunal federal de Estados Unidos por cargos de atraer a niñas menores para tener relaciones sexuales con él, si bien no fue hallado culpable de obstruir un caso estatal del 2008 que terminó con su absolución, según reportes de prensa.
Kelly, cuyo nombre completo es Robert Sylvester Kelly, fue declarado culpable de seis de los 13 cargos que enfrentó en el juicio, informó CBS Chicago.
En junio, el artista fue sentenciado a 30 años de prisión, nueve meses después de que fuera declarado culpable por cargos federales de crimen organizado y tráfico sexual tras años de usar su fama para captar a sus víctimas — algunas de ellas solo niñas — de las que abusó sexualmente.
“R. Kelly Kelly es un depredador. Esta es una victoria para sus víctimas, la justicia y para los futuros sobrevivientes de agresión sexual”, dijo Breon Peace, fiscal federal, tras la sentencia.
Muchos piensan que la condena de Kelly en Nueva York no puede entenderse sin el movimiento #MeToo. Ha sido el primer juicio sobre abusos sexuales en el que la mayoría de las denunciantes eran mujeres negras.
También es la primera vez que Kelly es condenado tras años de rumores de abusos a mujeres y niñas.

La fiscalía tenía que demostrar la culpabilidad de Kelly por crimen organizado, una acusación comúnmente relacionada con la mafia, considerado el capo de un grupo de colaboradores que facilitaron los abusos.
Con 45 testigos, entre ellos las 11 víctimas, la acusación demostró el intrincado patrón criminal que el artista tejió, amparado en su fama, para aprovecharse de mujeres y jóvenes adolescentes para su propia satisfacción sexual.
Las historias de las acusadoras mostraron un patrón de conducta: muchas de las presuntas víctimas dijeron haber conocido al cantante en conciertos o actuaciones en centros comerciales, y que su séquito les entregó papelitos con el contacto de Kelly.
A cambio recibían la promesa de que las ayudaría con su carrera musical.
Pero según la fiscalía, todas fueron “adoctrinadas” en el mundo de Kelly, preparadas para mantener relaciones sexuales a su antojo y controladas mediante “medios coercitivos”, como el aislamiento y medidas disciplinarias crueles, como lo demostraron algunas grabaciones escuchadas durante el juicio.
La prueba principal de la acusación es la relación que mantuvo Kelly con la cantante Aaliyah.
Kelly escribió y produjo su primer álbum -- “Age Ain’t Nothin’ But A Number” -- antes de casarse ilegalmente con ella cuando ella tenía 15 años porque temió haberla dejado embarazada.
Un antiguo representante reconoció en el juicio que sobornó a un funcionario para obtener documentos falsos y poder casarse, un matrimonio que fue posteriormente anulado.

R. Kelly Lawyer Likens Evidence to 'Cockroaches',"(Newser) – Jurors began deliberating Tuesday at R. Kelly's federal trial in Chicago, sorting through a month of evidence and arguments to decide verdicts on charges accusing the singer of producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex, and successfully rigging his 2008 child porn trial. A day after prosecutors delivered their closing argument, Kelly's lead attorney made hers. Standing at a podium a few feet in front of jurors, Jennifer Bonjean said key government witnesses were admitted liars who testified with immunity to ensure they couldn’t be charged, the AP reports. At times sounding indignant and raising her voice, Bonjean likened their testimony and other evidence to a cockroach and the government’s case to a bowl of soup the insect is found in.
""You don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup, You throw out the whole soup,"" said told jurors. She said of the prosecution’s case: ""There are just too many cockroaches."" As Bonjean spoke, Kelly, wearing a gray suit and black face mask, looked calm at a nearby defense table. He appeared to shake his head slightly a few times when a prosecutor spoke. Kelly, 55, was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison after a separate federal trial in New York where he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking. Convictions on just a few of the 13 counts Kelly faces at his current trial could add years to his imprisonment.
Bonjean implored jurors not to withdraw to the jury room with an impression of Kelly informed by media coverage of him in recent years or by prosecutors at the trial. ""They throw around labels like sex predator,"" she said about prosecutors. ""Labels and sweeping generalizations are distractions meant for you to lose your humanity for this man."" Delivering the government's rebuttal after Bonjean's closing, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors to remember the girls and women Kelly allegedly abused. ""When you are in the quiet of the jury room, consider the evidence in light of who is at the center of this case. Kelly’s victims: Jane, Nia, Pauline, Tracy, and Brittany,"" Appenteng said, referring to five Kelly accusers named in charging documents by their pseudonyms or first names.

"R. Kelly convicted on several counts, acquitted of trial fixing","CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography charges in his hometown of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography but was acquitted of a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008.
The decision comes after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, he won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.
The Chicago trial was, in many ways, a do-over of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both.
The legal challenges for Kelly — who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a Grammy-winning superstar — are not yet over. Two further trials are pending; one in Minnesota and another in state court in Chicago.
Kelly, who is known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” sold millions of albums even after abuse allegations began circulating in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
Jurors have reached a verdict at the trial of R. Kelly, who is accused in his hometown of Chicago of 13 charges including producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex and rigging his 2008 child pornography trial, prosecutors announced Wednesday.
The prosecutor’s office said the verdict would be announced soon. The jury deliberated for about 11 hours over two days.
Jurors began deliberating Tuesday after Judge Harry Leinenweber gave them instructions, including explicit descriptions of what constitutes sexual abuse.
Early Wednesday, jurors wrote several questions to the judge, at least one indicating the panelists may be grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.
In closing arguments Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said.
In her rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors to remember the girls and women who have accused Kelly of abuse.
“When you are in the quiet of the jury room, consider the evidence in light of who is at the center of this case. Kelly’s victims: Jane, Nia, Pauline, Tracy and Brittany,” Appenteng said, referring to five Kelly accusers named in charging documents by pseudonyms or their first names.
As Kelly’s fame boomed in the mid-1990s, Appenteng said, his inner circle increasingly focused on doing what the performer born Robert Sylvester Kelly wanted.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Kelly, 55, was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York in June and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Bonjean described Kelly as a flawed genius who has been functionally illiterate since childhood and was ill-equipped to navigate his celebrity and growing wealth. She said that he was abused as a child also deeply affected him.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct circulated in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly and co-defendant Derrell McDavid, Kelly’s ex-business manager, are accused of fixing Kelly’s 2008 trial on state child porn charges by intimidating and paying off witnesses.
Kelly faces four counts of producing child pornography, one of conspiring to obstruct justice by fixing the 2008 trial, one of conspiring to receive child porn, two of actually receiving it and five of enticing minors for sex.
McDavid is charged with four counts — two for receiving child porn, one for conspiring to do so and one for conspiring to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial, at which Kelly was acquitted.
Co-defendant Milton Brown, a former Kelly associate, faces a single count of conspiring to receive child pornography.

"R. Kelly convicted of child porn, enticing girls for sex","CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury in Chicago convicted R. Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a monthlong trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to the Grammy Award winning singer who was once one of the world’s biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six of the 13 counts against him, with many of the convictions carrying long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count — that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid — who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly’s believability — were acquitted of all charges.
The trial was, in ways, a do-over of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both. Kelly, who shed tears of joy when jurors acquitted him in 2008, gave a thumbs-up sign to spectators after Wednesday’s verdict but otherwise showed little emotion.
Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar.
Asked by reporters later outside court how Kelly felt after the verdict, his lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said: “Mr. Kelly is used to bad news.”
“He’s still got many fights to fight,” she said. “But what he did say is that he had a sense of relief that this particular case was in the past now.”
The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.
And two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly — one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Chicago-based U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed satisfaction with the verdict. He told reporters that, when you add up the potential punishments on the six guilty counts, Kelly was staring at at least 10 years and up to 90 in prison.
Judge Harry Leinenweber did not set a sentencing date. He could order that Kelly serve whatever sentence he imposes simultaneously with the New York sentence or only after that one is fully served. The latter would, for practical purposes, mean a life sentence.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Illinois portrayed Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Some dozen Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Bonjean, Kelly’s attorney, told jurors in her closings that the government had relied, in some cases, on liars and and blackmailers as witnesses. She earlier implored jurors not to see Kelly as “the monster” she said prosecutors so badly wanted them to see.
In her closing rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
All four Kelly accusers who testified went by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, didn’t testify, and jurors acquitted Kelly of the one charge related to her.
Four of his six convictions were tied directly to Jane and relied largely on her testimony.
She was the government’s star witness and also pivotal to the trial fixing charge, of which he was acquitted, and which accused him of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial. Three of the child porn charges that Kelly was convicted of Wednesday were related to that video and others depicting Jane.
Jane, 37, said publicly for the first time at the just-ended trial that the girl in the video was her at age 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify.
Asked on the witness stand how many times Jane and Kelly had sexually abused her before she turned 18, Jane answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. Soon after that, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly recorded the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. She told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ‘em. Period.”

During the five-week trial, several women took the stand and told jurors that Kelly sexually abused them when they were minors. The jury also saw a video of Kelly molesting his goddaughter, who testified that the abuse began in the 1990s when she was a teenager.
Kelly and both his codefendants, Milton “June” Brown and Derrel McDavid, were acquitted on charges that they conspired to receive child pornography. Kelly and McDavid were also acquitted on charges they conspired to obstruct justice in Kelly’s 2002 Cook County case, the Chicago Tribune reported.
The men were accused of trying to bribe and threaten witnesses in the 2008 Illinois case in which Kelly was found not guilty on 14 counts of child pornography.
In June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on his conviction in a New York federal court on racketeering and prostitution charges. That trial amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the Grammy-winning hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"" for two decades. read more
Kelly also faces various state charges in Illinois and Minnesota.

"R. Kelly is convicted on many counts, acquitted of trial fixing","But the jury acquitted him on a fourth pornography count as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008. He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges.
Kelly, 55, was found guilty on three counts of child pornography and three counts of child enticement.
CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography and sex abuse charges in his hometown of Chicago, delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R&B stars in the world.

His two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges.
Jurors, who deliberated for 11 hours over two days, wrote several questions to the judge on Wednesday, at least one indicating the panelists were grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities.
One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.
At trial, prosecutors sought to paint a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them.
Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover child pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said.
Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.

Kelly has already been convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
In Chicago, a conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum of five years. Judges can order that defendants sentenced earlier in separate cases serve their new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences.
During closing arguments Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors.
“There are just too many cockroaches,” she said of the prosecution’s case.
The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days. Co-defendant McDavid, who was on the stand for three days, may have damaged Kelly’s hopes for acquittal by saying that he now doubts Kelly was truthful when he denied abusing anyone after hearing the superstar’s accusers testify.
In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s.

“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Four Kelly accusers testified, all referred to by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify.
Sitting nearby in a suit and face mask, Kelly often averted his eyes and looked down as his accusers spoke.
Some dozen die-hard Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back.
Jane, 37, was the government’s star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents wouldn’t testify.
A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial.
On the witness stand for two days at the end of August, Jane paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue when she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her aged 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30.
Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify. At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane said she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video, saying part of her reason for lying was that she cared for Kelly and didn’t want to get him into trouble.

Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him.
Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 — the age of consent in Illinois — when Kelly began pursing her for sex.
Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster,” saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray.

“Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,” she said in her opening statement.
Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so journalists and spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions.
But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions.
Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998.
Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. At Kelly’s Chicago home later that year, Pauline described her shock when she said she first walked in on Kelly and a naked Jane. She said Kelly told her that everyone has secrets. “This is our secret,” she testified he said.
Pauline told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ‘em. Period.”",2022-09-14T04:00:00Z,https://www.bostonglobe.com,The Boston Globe

A federal jury in Chicago found R. Kelly guilty of producing child pornography and abusing minors in his second sex crimes trial in two years, the Associated Press reported.
The disgraced R&B star, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is already serving a 30-year sentence out of New York after prosecutors proved that he ran a decades-long sex trafficking enterprise through his music business. In that trial, 11 sexual abuse victims testified against him.
Nine women and two men who testified against him at that trial said that he lured them into sexual slavery after promising to help their careers in the music industry — promises he almost never kept.
The women, many of whom were teenagers when they met Kelly, testified that he directed them to have sex with him and each other and said the singer obsessively videotaped the sexual encounters.
The Chicago trial, which began on August 13, primarily dealt with the sex tapes that were part of a 2008 Illinois child pornography trial in which Kelly was acquitted after the witness declined to take the stand.
Now 37, the survivor, who goes by Jane, cooperated with prosecutors and was among four victims who took the stand.
Jurors were presented with three videos of Jane being abused by Kelly when she was a minor. In one, which had been sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times in 2002 and then turned over to police, a female voice could be heard referring to her ""14-year-old body.""
On the stand, Jane confirmed that she was the teenager in all three videos.
Kelly's former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and a former assistant, Milton ""June"" Brown, were also on trial for their alleged involvement in the scheme.

"R. Kelly convicted of child porn, enticing girls for sex","CHICAGO (AP) — A federal jury in Chicago convicted R. Kelly on Wednesday of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex after a monthlong trial in his hometown, delivering another legal blow to the Grammy Award winning singer who was once one of the world’s biggest R&B stars.
Prosecutors won convictions on six of the 13 counts against him, with many of the convictions carrying long mandatory sentences. But the government lost the marquee count — that Kelly and his then-business manager successfully rigged his state child pornography trial in 2008.
Both of his co-defendants, including longtime business manager Derrel McDavid — who had told jurors that testimony from four Kelly accusers had led him to change his mind about Kelly’s believability — were acquitted of all charges.
The trial was, in ways, a do-over of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial, with a key video critical to both. Kelly, who shed tears of joy when jurors acquitted him in 2008, gave a thumbs-up sign to spectators after Wednesday’s verdict but otherwise showed little emotion.
Before Kelly was returned to federal lockup, McDavid hugged Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar.
Asked by reporters later outside court how Kelly felt after the verdict, his lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said: “Mr. Kelly is used to bad news.”
“He’s still got many fights to fight,” she said. “But what he did say is that he had a sense of relief that this particular case was in the past now.”
The verdict comes months after a federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking. Based on that sentence, the 55-year-old won’t be eligible for release until he is around 80.
And two sexual misconduct trials still await Kelly — one in Minnesota and one in state court in Chicago.
After deliberating for 11 hours over two days, jurors convicted Kelly of three counts each of producing child pornography and enticement, while acquitting him of obstruction of justice, one count of production of child porn and three counts of receiving child porn.
Among the charges McDavid was acquitted of was conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Milton Brown, the other co-defendant, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.
Chicago-based U.S. Attorney John Lausch expressed satisfaction with the verdict. He told reporters that, when you add up the potential punishments on the six guilty counts, Kelly was staring at at least 10 years and up to 90 in prison.
Judge Harry Leinenweber did not set a sentencing date. He could order that Kelly serve whatever sentence he imposes simultaneously with the New York sentence or only after that one is fully served. The latter would, for practical purposes, mean a life sentence.

R. Kelly Convicted On Child Pornography And Sex Abuse Charges,"A Chicago jury found R. Kelly guilty of child pornography for taping his sexual encounters with underage girls, according to multiple reports, just months after the R&B singer was sentenced to three decades in prison in a separate sex trafficking case.
Singer R. Kelly leaves the Leighton Courthouse following his status hearing, in relation to the sex ... [+] abuse allegations made against him, on May 07, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.
Kelly was convicted on six of the 13 criminal charges brought against him by federal prosecutors, including counts of child pornography and child enticement for coercing three minors into criminal sexual activity and producing three child sexual abuse videos, according to the New York Times and other outlets.
He was acquitted on charges of receiving child pornography and obstruction, which stemmed from accusations he impeded on an earlier investigation, and two co-defendants—Kelly’s former employees Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown—were found not guilty, according to Chicago TV station WGN.
Kelly could face several years in prison, following a 30-year sentence handed down in June when he was convicted of sex trafficking in federal court in Brooklyn.
Kelly previously stood trial in Chicago over accusations he produced an explicit video featuring a 14-year-old girl in 2008, but jurors acquitted Kelly and later told media outlets the lack of testimony from the victim made a conviction difficult, according to the Times.
The victim decided to cooperate with investigators in 2019, shortly after the Lifetime documentary Surviving R. Kelly premiered, and during the trial this year, she testified that Kelly told her to lie to a 2002 grand jury and deny her appearance on the tape and their sexual relationship (three other women also testified that Kelly abused them before they turned 18).",2022-09-14T04:00:00Z,https://www.forbes.com,Forbes
R. Kelly convicted of child pornography in Chicago trial,"Disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly was convicted on three child pornography charges involving videotapes of him sexually abusing teenagers at his federal trial in Chicago on Wednesday.

Kelly was also convicted on three counts of enticing minors for sex. He was acquitted on two other counts.
A federal child pornography conviction comes with a mandatory 10-year prison sentence. Kelly may be able to serve his time consecutively or concurrently. No immediate date was set for sentencing.

The jury began deliberating on Tuesday after a month-long trial. They asked multiple questions and powered through an apparent impasse before delivering the verdict.
Kelly was already convicted on similar charges in Brooklyn Federal Court last year and sentenced to 30 years in prison. The Brooklyn jury found Kelly guilty of running a decades-long sex abuse scheme in which he used his fame to seduce and abuse young fans.

The Chicago federal trial dealt with different accusations from multiple women. One victim, testifying under the pseudonym Jane, said Kelly assaulted her uncountable times when she was between the ages of 13 and 18.
Jane also testified that she was the 14-year-old girl being abused in disgusting child sex tapes that featured Kelly and were played for the jury.
In 2008, Kelly was acquitted on child porn charges in a state trial in Illinois. The same videos were at the center of this year’s federal trial. At the 2008 trial, Jane did not testify.
Federal investigators argued that Kelly rigged that trial by paying off Jane’s family with vacations and hiding her in hotels during the proceedings. But the jury acquitted Kelly on the obstruction of justice charge that stemmed from those accusations.

Kelly started sexually abusing Jane when she was 14 and began having sex with her at 15, Jane testified. She said Kelly had sex with her “uncountable times” when she was between 15 and 18 years old.

R. Kelly é condenado por abuso sexual e pornografia infantil,"O cantor norte-americano R. Kelly, de 55 anos, foi considerado culpado hoje da acusação de atrair meninas menores de idade para fazer sexo com ele. No entanto, o artista foi inocentado de uma acusação de obstruir um caso de 2008 que terminou com sua absolvição, de acordo com reportagens da mídia.
Em seu mais recente julgamento, o músico —cujo nome completo é Robert Sylvester Kelly— foi considerado culpado em seis de 13 acusações em um julgamento federal, de acordo com a emissora CBS Chicago.
O júri no Tribunal Distrital dos EUA em Chicago condenou o cantor de R&B multipremiado, de 55 anos, por múltiplas acusações de exploração sexual de uma criança, sedução de uma mulher e posse de material contendo pornografia infantil.
Kelly está entre uma série de pessoas famosas que foram condenadas por má conduta sexual durante o movimento #MeToo contra o assédio e o abuso sexual nos últimos anos.
Durante o julgamento de cinco semanas, várias mulheres tomaram a palavra e disseram aos jurados que Kelly abusou sexualmente delas quando eram menores. O júri também viu um vídeo de Kelly molestando sua afilhada, que testemunhou que o abuso começou nos anos 1990, quando ela era adolescente.
Kelly e seus dois corréus, Milton ""June"" Brown e Derrel McDavid, foram absolvidos das acusações de que conspiraram para receber pornografia infantil. Kelly e McDavid também foram absolvidos de acusações de que conspiraram para obstruir a Justiça em um caso contra Kelly em 2002, segundo o jornal Chicago Tribune.
Em junho, Kelly foi condenado a 30 anos de prisão por um tribunal federal de Nova York por extorsão e acusações de prostituição. Esse julgamento amplificou as acusações que já perseguiam o cantor do sucesso vencedor do Grammy ""I Believe I Can Fly"" por duas décadas.

R. Kelly trial goes to jurors as deliberations begin,"The federal case in Chicago against R&B superstar R. Kelly is now in the hands of a jury at the end of a month-long trial.
Jurors left the courtroom to begin deliberations at 1:04 p.m.
The deliberations follow about three hours of closing arguments Tuesday, which ended with the final word from Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannice Appenteng. She reminded jurors of the alleged victims in the case, known in court as Jane, Pauline, Tracy, Nia and Brittany.
""They were children when [Kelly] engaged them in threesomes,"" Appenteng said. ""Find Robert Kelly guilty of sexually abusing these young women. Find him guilty of sexually abusing Jane. And for recording himself sexually abusing her over and over again as you saw.""
Kelly could be seen softly shaking his head as the prosecutor finished her presentation.
Kelly’s lawyer began her closing argument earlier Tuesday by reminding jurors of Kelly’s humble beginnings as ""a young, shy, introverted kid who had a dream to make it in the music industry"" — and was not ready for the success he achieved.

Pointing to Kelly’s 1990s anthem ""I Believe I Can Fly,"" attorney Jennifer Bonjean told jurors that ""no matter what you ultimately decide in the jury room, this man did some beautiful things when it came to making music.""
""And he should not be stripped of every bit of humanity that he has,"" Bonjean said.
She also told jurors that Kelly should have had the benefit of a pseudonym, like the alleged victims who testified in his trial over the last month at Chicago’s Dirksen Federal Courthouse.
Bonjean said a pseudonym would remind jurors ""that the lens through which you need to look at this evidence is as if he is a John Doe. Just anyone else. Not Robert Kelly. Not R. Kelly.""
Appenteng’s argument followed Bonjean’s. The prosecutor quoted testimony that ""R. Kelly had to have what he wanted.""
""What R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,"" Appenteng said.
The case against Kelly largely revolves around an alleged victim known to jurors as ""Jane."" A notorious video allegedly depicting Kelly’s abuse of Jane surfaced in the 2000s and became central to Kelly’s earlier state-court trial in 2008.
The feds have accused Kelly of rigging that trial, at which he was acquitted, in part by intimidating Jane and her family into lying to authorities.
The video from the 2008 trial, as well as three others, are now central to Kelly’s current trial.
Bonjean argued that Jane’s family made a choice when they learned about that apparent relationship when Jane was 17. She is now in her late 30s.
""She was 17 years old,"" Bonjean said. ""And they did not care that she was having a relationship, at that point, with Mr. Kelly.""
""For all the fist pounding and outrage, that family made a decision that they wanted to make at that time,"" Bonjean continued. ""And they lived with that decision … From that decision evolved a friendship that lasted decades.""
Bonjean encouraged jurors to acquit Kelly across the board, questioning whether the feds had also proven Kelly’s abuse of four additional accusers, Tracy, Pauline, Nia and Brittany.
But she acknowledged that the first three counts of Kelly’s indictment, in which he is accused of making video recordings of his sexual abuse of Jane, are the ""most difficult and serious"" in the indictment.
The defense attorney focused on technical points in the charge.
""Was his purpose to create child pornography?"" Bonjean asked.
She also questioned whether the videos crossed state lines.
Appenteng later said that Bonjean ""left alone any argument about whether it was Jane or whether it was Mr. Kelly on that tape.""
""Use Jane as your base and as your guide,"" Appenteng said. ""Everything happened to her in this case. From beginning to end. Kelly’s sexual abuse of her is clear.""
Jurors also heard closing arguments Monday from the government and Kelly’s two co-defendants, former business manager Derrel McDavid and former assistant Milton ""June"" Brown.
Laying out the case against Kelly then, Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo described the trio as a ""team"" that worked together to hide Kelly’s sexual abuse of underage girls for decades.
""They did their level best … to cover up the fact that Robert Kelly, R. Kelly the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator,"" Pozolo said.
She pointed to the government’s strongest evidence against the singer: video that purportedly shows the singer performing sex acts with Jane, whom Kelly considered his unofficial goddaughter.
""They did their best, but in the end, they failed,"" Pozolo said. ""We are here today because those tapes that they concealed for 20 years are no longer their secret. You have seen the tapes. You have seen what Kelly did to Jane.""
Testimony in the trial spanned four weeks, with Jane herself taking the witness stand to testify that she and her parents for years had lied about sexual abuse by the singer, including false statements made to Chicago police investigators and a state grand jury, which, nonetheless indicted the singer in 2002. Jane did not testify when the singer went to trial in 2008, and he was acquitted by a Cook County jury.
During her testimony, Jane identified herself in videos that purportedly show her abuse by the singer, including a tape in which Kelly and Jane could be heard referring repeatedly to her age as they perform sex acts in the late 1990s.
Monday, McDavid’s lawyers — as they did during the accountant’s three days on the witness stand — attacked the credibility of prosecution witnesses who had admitted to taking cash bounties to conceal alleged child porn videos. McDavid testified he believed the singer’s denials at the time.
""The information he had then is just different than what he had now,"" McDavid’s attorney, Beau Brindley said.",2022-09-14T02:08:49Z,https://www.fox4news.com,FOX 4 News
Day 2 of Jury Deliberations at R. Kelly's Child Porn Trial in Chicago,"Jurors were set to begin deliberating for a second day Wednesday at R. Kelly's federal trial in Chicago, sorting through a month of evidence and arguments on charges accusing the singer of producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex and rigging his 2008 child porn trial.
Jurors must consider 13 separate counts, some involving complex law and assessments of which witnesses were more believable. They began deliberating Tuesday after Judge Harry Leinenweber gave them jury instructions, including explicit descriptions of what constitutes sexual abuse.
Before they withdrew Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean sounded indignant, likening government testimony and evidence to a cockroach and the government’s case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,"" said told jurors. She said of the prosecution’s case: “There are just too many cockroaches.”

Kelly, 55, was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison during a separate federal trial in New York where he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking.
In her rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors to remember the girls and women Kelly allegedly abused.
“When you are in the quiet of the jury room, consider the evidence in light of who is at the center of this case. Kelly’s victims: Jane, Nia, Pauline, Tracy and Brittany,” Appenteng said, referring to five Kelly accusers named in charging documents by their pseudonyms or first names.
She said as Kelly's fame boomed in the mid-1990s, his inner circle increasingly geared everything they did to what Kelly wanted.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Bonjean described Kelly as a flawed genius who has been functional illiterate since childhood and was ill-equipped to navigate his celebrity and expanding wealth. She said having been abused as a child also deeply affected him.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct circulated in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly and co-defendant Derrell McDavid, Kelly's ex-business manager, are accused of fixing Kelly's 2008 trial on state child porn charges by intimidating and paying off witnesses.
Kelly faces four counts of producing child porn, one of conspiring to obstruct justice by fixing the 2008 trial, one of conspiring to receive child porn, two of actually receiving it and five of enticing minors for sex.
McDavid is charged with four counts — two for receiving child porn, one for conspiring to do so and one for conspiring to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial, at which Kelly was acquitted.

"R. Kelly found guilty on multiple counts in sexual abuse trial, local media reports","R&B singer R. Kelly was found guilty on Wednesday on charges of luring underage girls to have sex with him but not guilty of obstructing a 2008 state case that ended with his acquittal, according to media reports.
In his latest trial, Kelly - whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly - was found guilty on six out of 13 counts in the federal trial, CBS Chicago reported.
A jury in U.S. District Court in Chicago convicted the 55-year-old multiplatinum musical artist of multiple counts of sexual exploitation of a child, enticement of a female and possession of material containing child pornography.
Kelly is among the most prominent people convicted of sexual misbehavior during the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and abuse in recent years.
During the five-week trial, several women took the stand and told jurors that Kelly sexually abused them when they were minors. The jury also saw a video of Kelly molesting his goddaughter, who testified that the abuse began in the 1990s when she was a teenager.
Kelly and both his codefendants, Milton “June” Brown and Derrel McDavid, were acquitted on charges that they conspired to receive child pornography. Kelly and McDavid were also acquitted on charges they conspired to obstruct justice in Kelly’s 2002 Cook County case, the Chicago Tribune reported.
The men were accused of trying to bribe and threaten witnesses in the 2008 Illinois case in which Kelly was found not guilty on 14 counts of child pornography.
In June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on his conviction in a New York federal court on racketeering and prostitution charges. That trial amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the Grammy-winning hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"" for two decades.
Kelly also faces various state charges in Illinois and Minnesota.

Músico R. Kelly declarado culpado por pornografia infantil,"O cantor e produtor musical R. Kelly foi considerado culpado de seis acusações relacionadas com pornografia infantil.
No entanto, o júri absolveu o artista de uma quarta acusação de pornografia, bem como uma acusação de conspiração para obstruir a justiça, acusando-o de consertar o seu julgamento de pornografia infantil em 2008.
R. Kelly foi considerado inocente em todas as três acusações de conspiração para receber pornografia infantil e por duas incriminações de aliciamento.
Os seus corréus, Derrel McDavid e Milton Brown, foram considerados inocentes de todas as acusações.
No julgamento, os procuradores tentaram retratar o cantor como um mestre manipulador que usou a sua fama e riqueza para atrair fãs, incluindo alguns menores de idade, abusando sexualmente deles e depois descartá-los.
O artista estava desesperado para recuperar os vídeos pornográficos infantis que produzia e guardava numa mochila de ginástica, disseram testemunhas.
Testemunhas indicaram que R. Kelly ofereceu até um milhão de dólares (cerca de um milhão de euros) para recuperar vídeos perdidos antes do seu julgamento de 2008, sabendo que o colocariam em perigo.
A conspiração para esconder os seus abusos ocorreu entre 2000 e 2020, atentaram os procuradores.
R. Kelly já havia sido condenado por extorsão e tráfico sexual em Nova Iorque e condenado a 30 anos de prisão.
Em Chicago, uma condenação de apenas uma acusação de pornografia infantil acarreta uma sentença mínima obrigatória de 10 anos, enquanto a receção de pornografia infantil determina um mínimo obrigatório de cinco anos.",2022-09-13T23:00:00Z,https://sicnoticias.pt,SIC Notícias
Jury gets R. Kelly's child pornography and trial-fixing case,"Michael Tarm, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - Jurors began deliberating Tuesday at R. Kelly's federal trial in Chicago, sorting through a month of evidence and arguments to weigh charges accusing the singer of producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex and successfully rigging his 2008 child porn trial.
A day after prosecutors delivered their closing argument, Kelly's lead attorney made hers. Standing at a podium a few feet in front of jurors, Jennifer Bonjean said key government witnesses were admitted liars who testified with immunity to ensure they couldn't be charged.
At times sounding indignant and raising her voice, Bonjean likened their testimony and other evidence to a cockroach and the government's case to a bowl of soup.
“You don't just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors. She said of the prosecution's case: “There are just too many cockroaches.”
As Bonjean spoke, Kelly, wearing a gray suit and black mask, looked calm at a nearby defense table. He appeared to shake his head slightly a few times while a prosecutor spoke.
Kelly, 55, was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison during a separate federal trial in New York where he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking. Convictions on just a few of the 13 counts Kelly faces at his current trial could add years to his imprisonment.
Delivering the government's rebuttal after Bonjean's closing, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors to remember the girls and women Kelly allegedly abused.
“When you are in the quiet of the jury room, consider the evidence in light of who is at the center of this case. Kelly's victims: Jane, Nia, Pauline, Tracy and Brittany,” Appenteng said, referring to five Kelly accusers named in charging documents by their psydonyms or first names.
Four of them testified. Brittany did not.
The prosecutor also pointed to testimony that as Kelly's fame boomed in the mid-1990s, his staff and associates increasingly geared everything they did to what Kelly wanted.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” Appenteng said.
Earlier, Bonjean implored jurors not to withdraw to the jury room with an impression of Kelly informed by media coverage of him in recent years or by prosecutors at the trial.
“They throw around labels like sex predator,” she said about prosecutors. “Labels and sweeping generalizations are distractions meant for you to lose your humanity for this man.”
She described Kelly as a flawed genius who has had only “functional illiteracy” since childhood and was ill-equipped to navigate his celebrity and fortune. She said having been abused as a child also deeply affected him.
Bonjean said some witnesses who testified with immunity hadn't come to the courthouse in Chicago, Kelly's hometown, to tell the unvarnished truth.
“They came in here to tell the government's version of the truth,” she said.
Among others, Bonjean cited Kelly ex-girlfriend Lisa Van Allen, who testified about how she stole a sex tape from a Kelly gym bag in the early 2000s. She also pointed to former Kelly merchandizing agent Charles Freeman, who testified that he asked Kelly for $1 million in exchange for returning another, potentially incriminating, video. Both testified with immunity.
During her closing Monday, prosecutor Elizabeth Pozolo told jurors that weeks of evidence proved the singer parlayed his fame to sexually abuse minors and record the abuse on video. She described Kelly as a secret sexual predator.
“Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years,” Pozolo said, referring to the Grammy winner by his full name. “He committed horrible crimes against children. â€¦ All these years later, the hidden side of Robert Kelly has come out.”
Bonjean twice called for a mistrial Monday, complaining that closing arguments by attorneys for Kelly co-defendants Derrell McDavid and Milton Brown were grounded in the presumption that “the world now knows Mr. Kelly is a sex predator.”
“The presumption of innocence has been abolished for him,” she said. Judge Harry Leinenweber denied the requests.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n' Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct began circulating in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly and McDavid, the singer's former business manager, are accused of fixing Kelly's 2008 trial on state child porn charges by intimidating and paying off witnesses.
Kelly faces 13 counts, including four counts of producing child porn, one count of conspiring to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial, one count of conspiring to receive child porn, two counts of actually receiving it and five counts of enticing minors for sex.
McDavid is charged with four counts, including two counts of receiving child porn, one of conspiring to do so and one count of conspiring to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial.
Brown faces a single count of conspiring to receive child porn.
Pozolo focused much of her closing argument on the government's star witness, an accuser who went by “Jane” and who said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times starting when she was 14.
“He performed degrading acts upon her for his own sick pleasure,” Pozolo said.
She reminded jurors of graphic video footage they had watched, which Jane testified depicted Kelly, at around age 30, abusing her when she was 14. The videos shown included one at the heart Kelly's 2008 trial. Jurors said later they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because Jane didn't testify.
“Who uses a 14-year-old child to film a video like this?” she said. “This man. Robert Kelly.”
Before the 2008 trial, Pozolo said, Kelly and his associates scrambled to recover multiple sex videos that had gone missing from a collection he often carried around in a large gym bag.
By doing so, she said, Kelly associates sought “to cover up the fact that ... R. Kelly, the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator.”
In his closing, an attorney for McDavid said prosecutors had to show that his client actually knew about any abuse of Jane by Kelly in the 2000s - not just that it was likely he knew.
“Did they prove he knew ... behind a reasonable doubt?” Beau Brindley asked. “They did not.”
Pozolo balked at the idea that McDavid had no inkling in the 2000s that the abuse allegations might be credible after helping to recover missing recordings and handing bags of cash to people who returned videos McDavid knew could destroy Kelly.",2022-09-13T21:40:53Z,https://www.cp24.com,CP24 Toronto

Juryleden in Chicago begonnen met beraadslaging over R. Kelly,"De juryleden in de rechtszaak tegen R. Kelly in Chicago zijn dinsdag met hun beraadslagingen begonnen. Dat melden Amerikaanse media. Zij trokken zich terug voor hun overleg nadat zij de slotpleidooien hadden gehoord van de advocaten van de zanger en twee van zijn kompanen die ook terechtstaan.
In totaal wordt de 55-jarige Kelly verdacht van dertien vergrijpen, waaronder het produceren van kinderporno, het verleiden van minderjarigen tot seks en het belemmeren van de rechtsgang. Zijn twee partners worden verdacht van het terugkopen van oude seksvideo's uit de collectie van Kelly die als bewijs zouden kunnen dienen in een mogelijke zaak.
Tijdens de zaak werden ook beelden getoond die zijn gemaakt van het misbruik. Een van de belangrijkste getuigen is een vrouw die 'Jane' wordt genoemd en veertien jaar oud was toen zij zou zijn verkracht door Kelly.
Kelly wordt al sinds de jaren negentig beschuldigd van (kinder)misbruik. Zelf heeft hij altijd gezegd onschuldig te zijn. De zanger, die sinds 2019 vastzit, werd eind juni in New York al schuldig bevonden voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken.",2022-09-13T19:13:50Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen
R. Kelly child pornography trial,"CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly’s federal trial on charges accusing him of making child pornography and rigging his 2008 child porn trial went to the jury on Tuesday after prosecutors and the defense wrapped up their cases.
A day after prosecutors delivered their closing argument, Kelly’s lead attorney made hers. Standing at a podium a few feet in front of the jurors, Jennifer Bonjean noted that many key government witnesses, including some of the women who accused Kelly of sexually abusing them, testified with immunity to ensure they wouldn’t be charged with previously lying to authorities.
Bonjean said they hadn’t come to the courthouse in Chicago, Kelly’s hometown, to tell the unvarnished truth. “They came in here,” she said, “to tell the government’s version of the truth.”
Among others, she cited Kelly ex-girlfriend Lisa Van Allen, who testified about how she stole a sex tape from a Kelly gym bag in the early 2000s. Bonjean also pointed to the testimony of Kelly’s former merchandising agent Charles Freeman, who told jurors that he asked the singer for $1 million in exchange for returning another sex tape that could potentially incriminate the singer. Both testified with immunity.
Bonjean likened their testimony and other evidence to a cockroach and the government’s case to a bowl of soup the insect is found in.
“You don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup,” she said, noting of the prosecution’s case: “There are just too many cockroaches.”
Bonjean reminded jurors that she told them during her opening statement that the government would rely on “perjurers, blackmailers and extortionists,” and said prosecutors had done just that.
In rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that showed as Kelly’s fame boomed around 1995, his staff and associates increasingly geared everything they did to what Kelly wanted.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Kelly faces charges including production of child pornography, enticing minor girls for sex and obstruction of justice by rigging his 2008 child pornography trial in state court, at which he was acquitted. Jurors were expected to begin deliberating later Tuesday.
During her closing argument on Monday, prosecutor Elizabeth Pozolo told jurors that weeks of evidence proved the singer parlayed his fame to sexually abuse minors and record the abuse on video. She described Kelly as a secret sexual predator.
“Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years,” Pozolo said, referring to the 55-year-old Grammy winner by his full first name. “He committed horrible crimes against children. … All these years later, the hidden side of Robert Kelly has come out.”
Bonjean twice called for a mistrial Monday, complaining that closing arguments by attorneys for Kelly co-defendants Derrell McDavid and Milton Brown were grounded in the presumption that “the world now knows Mr. Kelly is a sex predator.”
“The presumption of innocence has been abolished for him,” Bonjean said, meaning Kelly was unable to get a fair trial. Judge Harry Leinenweber denied the requests.
Prosecutors will have the opportunity for a short rebuttal after Bonjean gives her closing argument in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago, where he rose from poverty to become an R&B superstar.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct began circulating in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly and McDavid, Kelly’s former business manager, are accused of fixing the 2008 trial by intimidating and paying off witnesses. Both face child pornography charges. Brown, a former Kelly associate, is accused of receiving child pornography.
Kelly was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison after a separate federal trial in New York, where he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking. Convictions on just a few of the 13 counts Kelly faces at his current trial could add years to his imprisonment.
Pozolo focused much of her closing argument on the government’s star witness, an accuser who went by “Jane” and who said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times starting when she was 14.

Mulher é presa após cuspir em passageiro e agredir comissário em avião,"Uma mulher foi condenada a quatro meses de prisão e três anos de liberdade condicional, em Nova York (EUA), após cuspir em passageiro e agredir um comissário dentro de um avião. Segundo a TV norte-americana CBS News e o Gabinete do Procurador dos EUA, as passageiras Kelly Pichardo, 32, e Leeza S. Rodriguez, 30, provocaram desordem dentro do voo.
O incidente ocorreu em fevereiro de 2021, mas só agora as autoridades deram a sentença de condenação. Na época, o voo que ia de Dallas para Los Angeles foi desviado para Phoenix, após as duas terem agredido um passageiro e um comissário de bordo na viagem.
Durante o voo, elas estavam na primeira classe e um homem pediu para que parassem de falar em voz alta, já que a conversa das duas tinha um forte teor racial e isso o incomodou. Uma delas cuspiu nele e o xingou, e quando ele tentou gravar a briga, ela derrubou o celular do rapaz.
Com a confusão instaurada, alguns dos tripulantes tentaram intervir na situação e um deles acabou sendo agredido. Sem soluções para apartar a briga, o voo foi desviado para Phoenix.
O caso foi investigado pelo FBI e pela polícia local, que indiciaram as duas por má-conduta ao agredir verbal e fisicamente outros passageiros e trabalhadores do avião.
Kelly foi condenada a pagar em torno de US$ 9.200 (aproximadamente R$ 47 mil na cotação atual) de restituição à American Airlines. Além disso, ela será supervisionada por três anos após sua prisão de quatro meses.
O procurador Gary Restaino repudiou a atitude das mulheres. ""Existe uma linha entre comportamento grosseiro em um avião e atividade criminosa, e a ré claramente a ultrapassou. Os passageiros de primeira classe não estão imunes a processos: a intimidação verbal e física interromperam a viagem de passageiros e tripulantes"".
Já Leeza se declarou culpada e será julgada em novembro.
A companhia aérea afirmou que as duas mulheres foram colocadas na lista de ""exclusão interna"" e está aguardando o desfecho das investigações.",2022-09-13T18:33:00Z,https://noticias.uol.com.br,UOL
Jury begins deliberations in R. Kelly's child pornography and obstruction of justice case,"CHICAGO — A Chicago jury began deliberating Tuesday in the federal trial of disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly, who faces charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice.
The case was handed over to the jury after about a month of testimony, including from multiple women who allege that Kelly had sex with them when they were minors.
Prosecutors have alleged that Kelly, 55, had sex with minors on numerous occasions, recorded many of the alleged assaults and then paid people who knew about the recordings to keep quiet when he faced criminal charges of child pornography in 2008.
Kelly, who already is serving a 30-year prison sentence after he was found guilty last year in New York City of federal racketeering and sex trafficking, is facing 13 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, receipt of child pornography, enticement of minors to engage in unlawful sexual conduct, conspiring to obstruct justice and conspiring to receive child pornography.
During the government's closing argument Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo told jurors that Kelly had committed “horrible crimes against children” and then, with the help of his business partners, tried to cover up his actions because he knew they would be “completely damning.”
Jennifer Bonjean, Kelly’s attorney, argued that the government's witnesses were not credible and implored jurors Tuesday to put aside their prior knowledge of Kelly when deliberating and focus only on the evidence presented during this trial.

""The government’s burden cannot be met with the inference of bad character, or tendency to commit crimes,"" Bonjean said during closing arguments. ""Your beliefs about Mr. Kelly’s character, even if it's justified, is not evidence that he committed the acts charged in the indictment. You may consider him to be the most amoral, dishonest person on the planet. And that has nothing to do whether the government has met its burden.""
Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is being tried alongside his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and an associate, Milton “June” Brown, who are accused of conspiring with him to intimidate and bribe witnesses and to cover up evidence in a 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges in Cook County.
The chief charge against Kelly and his associates is that they conspired to rig that trial, which centered on a 26-minute videotape sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times in 2002 that allegedly showed Kelly performing sex acts with an underage girl. NBC News has not viewed the videotape. He was acquitted in that case after the girl who purportedly appeared in the tape refused to testify at the trial. Jurors at the time said that made it difficult for them to convict Kelly.
The woman, now 37 and identified by the pseudonym Jane in court, was the prosecution’s star witness in this trial.
She testified that she had sex with Kelly “hundreds” of times from age 15 to 18. Under questioning from prosecutors, she said she did so because she was intimidated by him and considered him an “authoritative figure.”
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannice Appenteng told jurors Tuesday to ""use Jane as your base and as your guide"" during deliberations.
""From beginning to end, Kelly’s sexual abuse of her is clear,"" Appenteng said.
Bonjean, Kelly's attorney, however, said Tuesday that the government's case relied on ""perjurers, extortionists"" and witnesses who had received ""immunity deals.""
""They came in to tell the government’s truth,"" she said.
Supporters lined up early Tuesday hoping to get a seat in the courtroom for the last day of closing arguments. Some wore white in a show of solidarity with the disgraced singer. Several people prayed together as they waited, asking ""an angel to come through the courtroom"" to help Kelly.",2022-09-13T18:21:40Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
R. Kelly lawyer to deliver closing before jurors deliberate,"Musician R. Kelly, center, leaves the Daley Center after a hearing in his child support case on May 8, 2019, in Chicago.Matt Marton/The Associated Press
R. Kelly’s lead attorney gets her chance Tuesday to deliver her closing argument to federal jurors in Chicago, a day after a prosecutor told them that weeks of evidence proved the singer parlayed his fame to sexually abuse minors and record the abuse on video.
Kelly faces charges including production of child pornography, enticing minor girls for sex and obstruction of justice by rigging his 2008 child pornography trial in state court, at which he was acquitted. Jurors were expected to began deliberating later Tuesday.
In her closing, prosecutor Elizabeth Pozolo described Kelly as a secret sexual predator.
“Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years,” she said, referring to the 55-year-old Grammy winner by his full first name. “He committed horrible crimes against children. … All these years later, the hidden side of Robert Kelly has come out.”
Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean twice called for a mistrial Monday, complaining that closing arguments by attorneys for Kelly co-defendants Derrell McDavid and Milton Brown were grounded in the presumption that “the world now knows Mr. Kelly is a sex predator.”
“The presumption of innocence has been abolished for him,” Bonjean said, meaning Kelly was unable to get a fair trial. Judge Harry Leinenweber denied the requests.
Prosecutors will have the opportunity for a short rebuttal after Bonjean gives her closing argument in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago, where he rose from poverty to become an R&B superstar.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct began circulating in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly and McDavid, Kelly’s former business manager, are accused of fixing the 2008 trial by intimidating and paying off witnesses. Both face child pornography charges. Brown, a former Kelly associate, is accused of receiving child pornography.
Kelly was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison after a separate federal trial in New York, where he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking. Convictions on just a few of the 13 counts Kelly faces at his current trial could add years to his imprisonment.
Pozolo focused much of her closing argument on the government’s star witness, an accuser who went by “Jane” and who said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times starting when she was 14.
“He performed degrading acts upon her for his own sick pleasure,” Pozolo said.
She reminded jurors of graphic video footage they had watched, which Jane testified depicted Kelly, at around age 30, abusing her when she was 14. The videos shown included one at the heart Kelly’s 2008 trial. Jurors said later they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because Jane didn’t testify.
“Who does that? Who uses a 14-year-old child to film a video like this?” she said. “This man. Robert Kelly.”
Before Kelly’s 2008 trial, Pozolo said, Kelly and his associates scrambled to recover multiple sex videos that had gone missing from a collection he often carried around in a large gym bag.
By doing so, she said, Kelly associates sought “to cover up the fact that … R. Kelly, the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator.”
In his closing, an attorney for McDavid said prosecutors had to show that his client actually knew about any abuse of Jane by Kelly in the 2000s — not just that it was likely he knew.
“Did they prove he knew … behind a reasonable doubt?” Beau Brindley asked. “They did not.”
Pozolo balked at the idea that McDavid had no inkling in the 2000s that the abuse allegations might be credible after helping to recover missing recordings and handing bags of cash to people who returned videos McDavid knew could destroy Kelly.

R. Kelly Juror Replaced in Sex Abuse Trial After Courtroom Panic Attack,"A juror serving in R. Kelly's second sex abuse trial in Chicago was replaced on Monday after suffering a panic attack during closing arguments.
The juror, described as a white woman who works for a public library, was excused by the judge at around 3:30 p.m., hours after prosecutors and defense attorneys had started their closing arguments, per NBC News.
""I've been advised she said she can't go on one minute more,"" U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber told the court, before replacing the woman, Juror 44, with Juror 83, described in reports as a white man.
Chicago Tribune reporter Jason Meisner tweeted on Monday that the outgoing juror ""said during jury selection she'd seen headlines about Kelly's allegations but had not seen [the documentary] Surviving R. Kelly.""
""Leinenweber says the juror reported that she doesn't think 'she can go on one minute more' and that waiting overnight would not help,"" added Meisner. ""She'd be replaced by an alternate, Juror No. 83, a male white, 60ish.""

Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo on Monday accused Kelly of committing ""horrible crimes against children,"" before leaning on the help of his business partners to cover up actions that he knew to be ""completely damning,"" per NBC News.
Kelly, full name Robert Sylvester Kelly, is standing trial alongside his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and associate, Milton ""June"" Brown.
McDavid and Brown have been accused of conspiring to bribe and intimidate witnesses in a bid to conceal evidence pertaining to a 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges in Cook County, Illinois.
In June, Kelly was given a 30-year prison sentence in New York after being found guilty on nine counts of sex-trafficking and federal racketeering. Attorneys for Kelly, who has denied all wrongdoing, have announced plans to appeal the ruling.
Kelly is currently in the concluding stages of a second federal trial, charged with child pornography, sexual exploitation of children and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. As with his previous charges, Kelly denies all of the allegations.
In August, Kelly's fiancée Joycelyn Savage, 26, said that she was five months pregnant and expecting a girl with the 55-year-old musician—despite his lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, previously denying a claim recently made in a book that the two are having a baby together.
Responding, a ""very excited"" Savage has shared a sonogram with Entertainment Tonight, and explained that Kelly's lawyer ""didn't know that prior to him going to jail, Robert and I were doing IVF because at the time I was told I couldn't have a baby.""
Kelly was previously incarcerated at a Brooklyn prison but was moved to a Chicago detention center on July 12 ahead of the trial starting.
According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate database, Kelly is currently an inmate at the Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center.",2022-09-13T15:21:46Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
Dom väntas i rättegången mot R Kelly,"Du vet väl att du kan skapa ett gratiskonto på DN? Som inloggad kan du ta del av flera smarta funktioner.
R'n'b-sångaren R Kelly, egentligen Robert Kelly, står åter inför rätta i sin hemstad Chicago. Anklagelserna gäller misstänkta sexuella övergrepp på en minderårig i ett känt fall som prövades redan 2008. Det påstådda offret vittnade aldrig och R Kelly friades mycket tack vare detta.
Nu har den 37-åriga kvinnan varit ett centralt vittne i den pågående rättegången, där hon pekat ut sig själv i en sexvideo – som spelades in då hon var 14.
– Jag skyddade honom. Jag ville inte att den personen skulle vara jag. Jag skämdes, sade hon.
Under tisdagen ska R Kellys advokater hålla sina slutpläderingar och därefter väntas juryn överlägga innan man meddelar sin dom. Åklagaren Elizabeth Pozolo kallade i sin slutplädering R Kelly ”ett rovdjur” och menade att han dolt sina mörka sidor under lång tid.
Kvinnan vars vittnesmål ligger till grund för rättegången har uppgivit att hon som 13-åring bad R Kelly att bli hennes gudfar eftersom hon såg upp till honom. Under rättegången berättade hon också att R Kelly hade sex med henne ”hundratals gånger” innan hon fyllde 18 år.
R Kelly dömdes tidigare i år till 30 års fängelse på nio åtalspunkter. Han ansågs ha utnyttjat sitt kändisskap för att locka till sig kvinnor och minderåriga flickor som han sedan förgripit sig på.

O R. Kelly καταδικάστηκε ξανά για σεξουαλική κακοποίηση ανηλίκων,"Ο τραγουδιστής της R&B, ο 55χρονος R. Kelly, κρίθηκε ένοχος ότι παρέσυρε ανήλικα κορίτσια για να έχουν σεξουαλικές επαφές μαζί του, αλλά αθωώθηκε για την κατηγορία της παρακώλυσης της δικαιοσύνης σε μια υπόθεση του 2008, η οποία κατέληξε στην αθώωσή του.
Σύμφωνα με το Reuters, ο R. Kelly κρίθηκε ένοχος για έξι από τις δεκατρείς κατηγορίες που του είχε απαγγείλει ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο, σύμφωνα με το CBS Chicago.
Οι ένορκοι στο δικαστήριο του Σικάγο καταδίκασαν τον 55χρονο καλλιτέχνη για σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση ανηλίκων, αποπλάνηση και κατοχή υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας. Η ετυμηγορία του δικαστηρίου ανακοινώθηκε ύστερα από συνολικά 11 ώρες διαβουλεύσεων του σώματος των ενόρκων στη διάρκεια των τελευταίων δύο ημερών. Ο R. Kelly αντιμετωπίζει ποινή φυλάκισης τουλάχιστον 10 ετών.
Οι κατηγορίες σε βάρος του R. Kelly - Οι προηγούμενες καταδίκες
Ο R. Kelly είναι ένας από τους πιο διάσημους καλλιτέχνες που καταδικάστηκαν για αδικήματα σεξουαλικής φύσεως στη διάρκεια των αποκαλύψεων του κινήματος #MeToo ενάντια στη σεξουαλική παρενόχληση και κακοποίηση.
Κατά την ακροαματική διαδικασία που κράτησε πέντε εβδομάδες, αρκετές γυναίκες κατέθεσαν ως μάρτυρες και αφηγήθηκαν στους ενόρκους πώς ο Κέλι τις παρέσυρε και τις κακοποίησε σεξουαλικά όταν ήταν ανήλικες. Το σώμα των ενόρκων παρακολούθησε επίσης ένα βίντεο με τον Kelly να παρενοχλεί σεξουαλικά τη βαφτιστήρα του, η οποία κατέθεσε πως η κακοποίησή της ξεκίνησε τη δεκαετία του 1990 όταν ήταν έφηβη. Ο Κέλι και οι άλλοι δύο συγκατηγορούμενοι, Μίλτον «June» Μπράουν και Ντέρελ Μακντέιβιντ, αθωώθηκαν για την κατηγορία της συνωμοσίας με στόχο την απόκτηση υλικού παιδικής πορνογραφίας. Ο Kelly και ο Μακντέιβιντ αθωώθηκαν επίσης για την κατηγορία της συνωμοσίας με στόχο την παρακώλυση της δικαιοσύνης σε μια υπόθεση του 2002, σύμφωνα με την εφημερίδα Chicago Tribune. Οι εναγόμενοι κατηγορούνταν επίσης για απόπειρα δωροδοκίας και εκβιασμού μαρτύρων σε μια υπόθεση του 2008 στο Ιλινόι, στην οποία ο Κέλι αθωώθηκε για κατηγορίες που αφορούσαν παιδική πορνογραφία.
Τον περασμένο Ιούνιο, ο R. Kelly καταδικάστηκε σε φυλάκιση 30 ετών αφότου ομοσπονδιακό δικαστήριο της Νέας Υόρκης τον έκρινε ένοχο για εκβιασμούς, σεξουαλική εκμετάλλευση και εξώθηση στην πορνεία. Αυτή η δίκη ενίσχυσε τις κατηγορίες που βαρύνουν τον τραγουδιστή της βραβευμένης με Grammy επιτυχίας «I Believe I Can Fly» εδώ και δύο δεκαετίες.
Ο R. Κelly αντιμετωπίζει επίσης κατηγορίες για ανάλογες υποθέσεις στο Ιλινόι και στη Μινεσότα.

After about five hours of closing arguments Monday from federal prosecutors and attorneys for two co-defendants, R. Kelly’s lead attorney is set to begin her final presentation to jurors Tuesday morning.
After Jennifer Bonjean concludes, prosecutors are expected to give about an hour of rebuttal argument, after which jurors would be formally instructed on the law and begin to deliberate.

The arguments come as Kelly’s trial has stretched into its fifth week at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. Jurors have heard from nearly three dozen witnesses since mid August.
Toward the end of Monday’s closing arguments, one juror informed authorities she was having a panic attack and she could not continue. Judge Harry Leinenweber dismissed her and replaced her with an alternate.

Kelly, 55, faces an indictment charging him with 13 counts of producing and receiving child pornography, enticing minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Also charged are former Kelly associates McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, who are accused in an alleged scheme to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and to hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.
The arguments began Monday with a scathingly methodical presentation from prosecutors and a fire-and-brimstone statement on behalf of Kelly’s former business manager.

Prosecutors in the packed ceremonial courtroom started by reminding jurors of their strongest evidence against the singer: The multiple videos they viewed showing Kelly sexually abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter, “Jane.”
“Kelly and his team, they did their level best … to cover up the fact that Robert Kelly, R. Kelly the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator. They did their best, but in the end, they failed,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo said.
“We are here today because those tapes that they concealed for 20 years are no longer their secret. You have seen the tapes. You have seen what Kelly did to Jane.”
Meanwhile, the attorney for Kelly’s co-defendant, Derrel McDavid, told jurors in his closing argument that the prosecution was riddled with reasonable doubt and based on untrustworthy witnesses, and that McDavid had no way of knowing whether Kelly was really sexually abusing minors.
“The man didn’t know,” lawyer Beau Brindley said. “They’ve got nothing! ... Their case can’t be trusted.”

Prosecutors will have the opportunity for a short rebuttal after Bonjean gives her closing argument in Kelly's hometown of Chicago, where he rose from poverty to become an R&B superstar.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct began circulating in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”

Kelly and McDavid, Kelly’s former business manager, are accused of fixing the 2008 trial by intimidating and paying off witnesses. Both face child pornography charges. Brown, a former Kelly associate, is accused of receiving child pornography.
Kelly was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison after a separate federal trial in New York, where he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking. Convictions on just a few of the 13 counts Kelly faces at his current trial could add years to his imprisonment.
Pozolo focused much of her closing argument on the government's star witness, an accuser who went by “Jane” and who said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times starting when she was 14.
""He performed degrading acts upon her for his own sick pleasure,” Pozolo said.

She reminded jurors of graphic video footage they had watched, which Jane testified depicted Kelly, at around age 30, abusing her when she was 14. The videos shown included one at the heart Kelly's 2008 trial. Jurors said later they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because Jane didn't testify.
“Who does that? Who uses a 14-year-old child to film a video like this?"" she said. “This man. Robert Kelly.”
Before Kelly’s 2008 trial, Pozolo said, Kelly and his associates scrambled to recover multiple sex videos that had gone missing from a collection he often carried around in a large gym bag.
By doing so, she said, Kelly associates sought “to cover up the fact that ... R. Kelly, the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator.""
In his closing, an attorney for McDavid said prosecutors had to show that his client actually knew about any abuse of Jane by Kelly in the 2000s — not just that it was likely he knew.

“Did they prove he knew ... behind a reasonable doubt?"" Beau Brindley asked. “They did not.”
Pozolo balked at the idea that McDavid had no inkling in the 2000s that the abuse allegations might be credible after helping to recover missing recordings and handing bags of cash to people who returned videos McDavid knew could destroy Kelly.

Article content But the jury acquitted him on a fourth pornography count as well as a conspiracy to obstruct justice charge accusing him fixing his state child pornography trial in 2008. He was found not guilty on all three counts of conspiring to receive child pornography and for two further enticement charges. His two co-defendants were found not guilty on all charges. Jurors, who deliberated for 11 hours over two days, wrote several questions to the judge on Wednesday, at least one indicating the panelists were grappling with some of the case’s legal complexities. One asked if they had to find Kelly both enticed and coerced minors, or that he either enticed or coerced them. Over objections from Kelly’s lawyer, the judge said they only need to find one.

Article content At trial, prosecutors sought to paint a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-stuck fans, some of them minors, to sexually abuse then discard them. Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, was desperate to recover child pornographic videos he made and lugged around in a gym bag, witnesses said. They said he offered up to $1 million to recover missing videos before his 2008 trial, knowing they would land him in legal peril. The conspiracy to hide his abuse ran from 2000 to 2020, prosecutors said. Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown were co-defendants at the Chicago trial. Jurors acquitted McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, who was accused of conspiring with Kelly to rig the 2008 trial. Brown, a Kelly associate for years, was acquitted of receiving child pornography.

Article content Kelly has already been convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York and sentenced to 30 years in prison. In Chicago, a conviction of just one count of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, while receipt of child pornography carries a mandatory minimum of five years. Judges can order that defendants sentenced earlier in separate cases serve their new sentence simultaneously with or only after the first term is fully served. Federal inmates must serve at least 85% of their sentences. Recommended from Editorial R. Kelly sentenced to 30 years in sex trafficking case Old tape appears to show new incident of R. Kelly abuse During closing arguments Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean likened the government’s testimony and evidence to a cockroach and its case to a bowl of soup.

You throw out the whole soup,” said told jurors. “There are just too many cockroaches,” she said of the prosecution’s case. The three defendants called only a handful of witnesses over four days. Co-defendant McDavid, who was on the stand for three days, may have damaged Kelly’s hopes for acquittal by saying that he now doubts Kelly was truthful when he denied abusing anyone after hearing the superstar’s accusers testify. In her closing rebuttal, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng cited testimony that Kelly’s inner circle increasingly focused on doing what Kelly wanted as his fame boomed in the mid-1990s. “And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.

Article content Four Kelly accusers testified, all referred to by pseudonyms or their first names: Jane, Nia, Pauline and Tracy. Some cried when describing the abuse but otherwise spoke calmly and with confidence. A fifth accuser, Brittany, did not testify. Sitting nearby in a suit and face mask, Kelly often averted his eyes and looked down as his accusers spoke. Some dozen die-hard Kelly fans regularly attended the trial. On at least one occasion during a break, several made hand signs of a heart at Kelly. He smiled back. Jane, 37, was the government’s star witness and pivotal to the fixing charge, which accused Kelly of using threats and payoffs to get her to lie to a grand jury before his 2008 trial and to ensure she and her parents wouldn’t testify.

Article content A single video, which state prosecutors said was Kelly abusing a girl of around 14, was the focal point of that trial. On the witness stand for two days at the end of August, Jane paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue when she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her aged 14 and that the man was Kelly, who would have been around 30. Some jurors in the 2008 trial said they had to acquit Kelly because the girl in the video didn’t testify. At the federal trial in Chicago, Jane said she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video, saying part of her reason for lying was that she cared for Kelly and didn’t want to get him into trouble. Jane told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. â¦ Hundreds.”

Article content Jane, who belonged to a teenage singing group, first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had visited Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather. Jane testified that when her parents confronted Kelly in the early 2000s he dropped to his knees and begged them for forgiveness. She said she implored her parents not to take action against Kelly because she loved him. Defense attorneys suggested a desire for money and fame drove some government witnesses to accuse Kelly, and they accused several people of trying to blackmail him. They also suggested that at least one of his accusers was 17 — the age of consent in Illinois — when Kelly began pursing her for sex.

Article content Bonjean implored jurors not to accept the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster,” saying Kelly was forced to rely on others because of intellectual challenges, and that he was sometimes led astray. “Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,” she said in her opening statement. Prosecutors played jurors excerpts from three videos that Jane said featured her. Court officials set up opaque screens around the jurors so journalists and spectators couldn’t see the videos or the jurors’ reactions. But the sound was audible. In one video, the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks: “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man gives her sexually explicit instructions. Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video that was also evidence in the 2008 trial in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 1998. Another accuser, Pauline, said Jane introduced her to Kelly when they were 14-year-old middle school classmates in 1998. At Kelly’s Chicago home later that year, Pauline described her shock when she said she first walked in on Kelly and a naked Jane. She said Kelly told her that everyone has secrets. “This is our secret,” she testified he said. Pauline told jurors she still cares for Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now has a different perspective. “If somebody did something to my kids,” she said, “I’m killing ’em. Period.”

R. Kelly lawyer: Prosecution case relies on ‘perjurers’,"CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly’s lead attorney told jurors during her closing argument Tuesday that federal prosecutors’ case accusing the singer of producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex and rigging his 2008 child porn trial largely rests on the testimony of perjurers and blackmailers.
Standing at a podium a few feet in front of jurors, Jennifer Bonjean noted that many key government witnesses, including some of the women who accused Kelly of sexually abusing them, testified with immunity to ensure they wouldn’t be charged with previously lying to authorities.
Bonjean said they hadn’t come to the courthouse in Chicago, Kelly’s hometown, to tell the unvarnished truth. “They came in here,” she said, “to tell the government’s version of the truth.”
Among others, she cited Kelly ex-girlfriend Lisa Van Allen, who testified about how she stole a sex tape from a Kelly gym bag in the early 2000s. Bonjean also pointed to the testimony of Kelly’s former merchandizing agent Charles Freeman, who told jurors that he asked the singer for $1 million in exchange for returning another sex tape that could potentially incriminate the singer. Both testified with immunity.
Bonjean likened their testimony and other evidence to a cockroach and the government’s case to a bowl of soup the insect is found in.
“You don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup,” she said, noting of the prosecution’s case: “There are just too many cockroaches.”
Bonjean reminded jurors that she told them during her opening statement that the government would rely on “perjurers, blackmailers and extortionists,” and said prosecutors had done just that.
On Monday, a prosecutor in her closing told jurors that weeks of evidence proved the singer parlayed his fame to sexually abuse minors and record the abuse on video.

"R. Kelly trial: Closing arguments begin, prosecutors call singer 'sexual predator'","Closing arguments begin in the Chicago federal trial of singer R. Kelly who faces a 13-count indictment on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges. File photo by Jim Ruymen/UPI | License Photo
Sept. 12 (UPI) -- The first day of closing arguments in the Chicago federal trial of R. Kelly wrapped up Monday with prosecutors describing the R&B singer as a ""sexual predator."" Kelly, 55, faces a 13-count indictment on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges, along with two former associates. Advertisement
""Kelly and his team, they did their level best ... to cover up the fact that Robert Kelly, R. Kelly the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator. They did their best, but in the end, they failed,"" Assistant Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo told the packed courtroom.
Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is accused of coercing five children into sex acts, including his 14-year-old goddaughter ""Jane,"" and creating child pornography between September 1998 and September 1999, court records obtained by UPI show.
Kelly was tried in Chicago in 2008 and was acquitted on 14 counts of producing child pornography. A video from that trail has become a key piece of evidence in his new trial.
""We are here today because those tapes that they concealed for 20 years are no longer their secret,"" Pozolo told jurors. ""You have seen the tapes. You have seen what Kelly did to Jane.""

Four women, including ""Jane,"" accused Kelly of sexually abusing them when they were girls. While ""Jane"" denied that Kelly abused her in his 2008 child pornography trial, she testified in this trial that Kelly intimidated her and her family and paid them off to keep the abuse secret.
Kelly faces additional charges for allegedly conspiring to fix the 2008 trial with Derrel McDavid, a former employee who is a co-defendant in the latest trial. A third man, Milton Brown, has also been charged for having allegedly received missing recordings of the child sex abuse.
McDavid's attorney told jurors in his closing argument the prosecution was based on untrustworthy witnesses and that McDavid could not have known whether Kelly was sexually abusing minors.
""The man didn't know,"" attorney Beau Brindley said. ""They've got nothing! ... Their case can't be trusted.""
During closing arguments, a juror was excused from the panel after she reported suffering a panic attack. The juror was the second to be replaced during the trial due to a medical issue.
Kelly's attorney Jennifer Bonjean, the attorney who helped comedian Bill Cosby get his criminal sexual assault conviction overturned in Pennsylvania, is expected to deliver her closing argument Tuesday.

Kelly is already facing 30 years in prison after he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking charges in federal court in New York last year. If he is convicted of the federal charges in Chicago, Kelly could face additional decades in prison.
""In sum, Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years. He committed horrible crimes against children. And he didn't do it alone,"" Pozolo said. ""The hidden side of Robert Kelly has come to light. The truth has come out.""",2022-09-13T02:52:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
Prosecutor says R. Kelly ‘degraded’ girl for his ‘sick pleasure’,"R. Kelly parlayed his fame as an R&B superstar to sexually abuse minors and record that abuse on video, a prosecutor told jurors Monday at the singer’s federal trial on charges of child pornography and of rigging his 2008 state child pornography trial.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo several times raised her voice and singled out Kelly, describing him as a secret sexual predator in closing arguments in Kelly’s hometown of Chicago, where he rose from poverty.
“Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years,” she said, referring to the 55-year-old Grammy winner’s full first name. “He committed horrible crimes against children. All these years later, the hidden side of Robert Kelly has come out.”
Jurors are expected to began deliberating Tuesday after Kelly’s lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, makes her closing argument and prosecutors give a short rebuttal.
Bonjean twice called for a mistrial Monday, complaining that closing arguments by attorneys for Kelly co-defendants Derrell McDavid and Milton Brown were grounded in the presumption that “the world now knows Mr. Kelly is a sex predator.”
“The presumption of innocence has been abolished for him,” Bonjean said about Kelly, meaning he was unable to get a fair trial. Judge Harry Leinenweber denied the requests.
Known for his smash hit I Believe I Can Fly and for sex-infused songs such as Bump n’ Grind, Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct began circulating in the 1990s and after his 2008 Illinois trial, at which he was acquitted. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries Surviving R. Kelly.
Kelly and McDavid, Kelly’s former business manager, are charged with fixing the 2008 trial. Both face child pornography charges. Brown, a former Kelly associate, is accused of receiving child pornography.
Kelly already was sentenced to 30 years in prison after a separate federal trial in New York in June. Convictions on just a few of the 13 counts Kelly faces at his current trial could add years to that.
Pozolo, the prosecutor, focused much of her closing argument Monday on a Kelly accuser who went by “Jane” and who was considered the government’s star witness. She testified that Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times starting when she was 14.
“He took advantage of Jane’s youth,” Pozolo said about Kelly. “He repeatedly abused her. He performed degrading acts upon her for his own sick pleasure.”
Pozolo reminded jurors of graphic video footage they watched earlier at the trial, recordings that Jane testified depicted Kelly, at around age 30, abusing her when she was 14. Among the videos jurors saw was one at the heart Kelly’s 2008 trial. Jurors at that trial said later they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because Jane didn’t testify then.
“That abuse is forever memorialized,” Pozolo told jurors. “Who does that? Who uses a 14-year-old child to film a video like this? This man. Robert Kelly.”
Before Kelly’s 2008 trial, Pozolo said, Kelly and his associates scrambled to recover multiple sex videos that had gone missing from a collection he often carried around in a large gym bag.
By doing so, she said, Kelly associates sought “to cover up the fact that ... R. Kelly, the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator.”
Pozolo said the fact that Jane and three other Kelly accusers had so much to lose by testifying should give jurors confidence they told the truth on the stand.
“They opened up old wounds to tell you what happened to them and who did it to them,” she said.
In his closing, an attorney for McDavid said prosecutors had to show that his client actually knew about any abuse of Jane by Kelly in the 2000s – not just that it was likely he knew.
“Did they prove he knew ... behind a reasonable doubt?” Beau Brindley asked. “They did not.”
Earlier Monday, Pozolo balked at the idea that McDavid had no inkling in the 2000s that the abuse allegations might be credible after helping to recover missing recordings and handing bags of cash to people who returned videos McDavid knew could destroy Kelly.
“Really? Does that make any sense?” she said. “It doesn’t make sense.”
Also Monday, the judge replaced one juror with an alternate after the panelist reported having a panic attack while listening to closing arguments.
McDavid was the only defendant who testified during the trial that started Aug. 15. Combined, lawyers for the three co-defendants called several witnesses over four days, with McDavid on the stand for three. The witnesses mostly gave testimony favourable to all three defendants. But McDavid may have hurt Kelly’s defence by ultimately questioned Kelly’s believability, saying that listening to Kelly accusers testify at the current had altered his views of the singer.

R. Kelly Trial Juror Excused After Suffering Panic Attack,"R.Kelly's ongoing sexual abuse trial is not only stressful for the victims and the culprit, but for all parties involved. During Monday's hearing, a young, female juror was reportedly excused from the court by the judge after suffering a panic attack during a break in proceedings. According to reports, the unidentified, white woman who works for a public library, was excused by Judge Harry Leinenweber, hours into closing arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys.
Before replacing the woman with a White man juror, the U.S. District Judge shared with the courts, ""I’ve been advised she said she can’t go on one minute more."" Similar to the young woman, the unidentified male has also not seen the ""Surviving R. Kelly"" documentary. Last month, the singer lost his bid to exclude jurors who have seen the Lifetime docuseries, which details years of sexual abuse allegations against Kelly. His attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, filed a motion to the courts, saying, ""Allowing an individual to sit on this jury who has seen ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ is no different than allowing a juror to sit on the jury who was permitted to preview the discovery in this case.”
However, Judge Leinenweber denied Kelly's request and opted for a mixed jury. R. Kelly is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence after he was found guilty in New York last year on charges of federal racketeering and sex trafficking. The ""Ignition"" singer and his former business manager, Derrel McDavid are currently on trial for conspiring with him to intimidate and bribe witnesses and to cover up evidence in a 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges in Cook County.
Depending on how long the jury takes to decide on a verdict, Kelly and McDavid will soon know their fate. More details to come.

Juror excused in R. Kelly trial after suffering panic attack,"A juror in R. Kelly’s child porn trial was excused after she began to suffer a panic attack and couldn’t “go on one minute more” in the middle of closing arguments Monday, according to a report.
In this courtroom sketch, R. Kelly briefly addresses Judge Ann Donnelly during his sentencing in federal court, June 29, 2022, in New York. AP
The disgraced R&B star’s federal trial in Chicago has been going on for the last month on charges he and his former business manager allegedly conspired to undermine the state’s case against Kelly during a 2008 trial that ended in the acquittal of the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer.
Kelly and co-defendant Derrel McDavid also face child pornography charges. Another co-defendant, Milton Brown, a Kelly associate, is accused of receiving child porn.
US District Judge Harry Leinenweber said in court the juror, a white female who works for a public library, was having a panic attack that led to her exit, the Chicago Tribune reported.
The newspaper reported the juror told courtroom staff she “doesn’t think she can go on one minute more” and waiting overnight wouldn’t change that, Leinenweber said. The development came about four hours into closing arguments.
The dismissed juror was replaced by an alternate, a white male who appears to be in his 60s, according to the Tribune.
Prosecutors called Kelly, 55, nothing but “a sexual predator” who used his fame and fortune to prey on underage girls during their closing argument Monday.
Federal prosecutor Elizabeth Pozolo also told jurors Kelly and McDavid threatened women and hid video evidence during the 2008 trial to cover up Kelly’s sex crimes.

Juror excused from R. Kelly child sex abuse trial after having panic attack during closing arguments,"A juror in R. Kelly's federal trial on charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice was replaced Monday after she had a panic attack during closing arguments.
The juror, a white woman who works for a public library, was excused by the judge around 3:30 p.m. local time, hours into closing arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys.
“I’ve been advised she said she can’t go on one minute more,” U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber said before he replaced Juror 44 with Juror 83, a white man.
The switch came after Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo and a defense attorney had presented closing arguments. The trial continued after the change was made.
Kelly, 55, is on trial in federal court in Chicago on charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice. He is already serving a 30-year prison sentence after he was found guilty last year in New York City on charges of federal racketeering and sex trafficking.
Pozolo told jurors Monday that Kelly had committed ""horrible crimes against children"" and then, with help from his business partners, tried to cover up his actions because he knew they would be ""completely damning.""
The singer, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is being tried alongside his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and an associate, Milton “June” Brown, who are both accused of conspiring with him to intimidate and bribe witnesses and to cover up evidence in a 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges in Cook County.
Of the three, only McDavid testified during the trial.
In closing arguments, McDavid’s defense attorney, Beau Brindley, attacked the credibility of two government witnesses who testified that he conspired with Kelly.
“The only two people who said he did anything wrong are two people who plainly lied,” Brindley said.
“The evidence fits together to expose a lie,” he said.
An attorney for Brown, Mary Judge, said he was ""nothing more than an assistant"" to Kelly and that he did not know about any wrongdoing and therefore could not have been involved in covering it up.
Brown ""had no knowledge of what was on the tapes, and there’s no evidence that he did,"" Judge said, referring to videos that prosecutors allege recorded Kelly sexually abusing a minor.
Jurors heard only from Pozolo, Brindley and Judge on Monday. Closing arguments will continue Tuesday with Judge and Kelly's attorney.
A large crowd of fans and supporters lined up to get into the courtroom Monday morning to catch a glimpse of Kelly.
Inside the courtroom, a supporter quietly read aloud from the Bible, while another recited the rosary. Another woman asked people to move out of her line of sight during breaks in the trial so she could keep her eyes locked on Kelly. A few people who tried to sneak into the courtroom were escorted out by marshals.
Prosecutors have sought throughout the monthlong trial to prove that Kelly and his associates conspired to keep video recordings of him allegedly sexually abusing a minor from coming to light. Prosecutors showed jurors parts of the videos.
Kelly, McDavid and Brown did their best ""to cover up the fact that R. Kelly, the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator,"" Pozolo said Monday.
“Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years. He committed horrible crimes against children. And he didn’t do it alone,” Pozolo said. McDavid and Brown “worked to get those tapes back because they would be completely damning.”
Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, was acquitted in 2008 in a case that revolved around one of the tapes after the girl who purportedly appeared in the recording refused to testify at the trial. Jurors at the time said that made it difficult for them to convict Kelly.
The woman, who is now 37 and was identified by the pseudonym Jane in court, was the prosecution’s star witness in this trial.
Jane testified that she had sex with Kelly “hundreds” of times from age 15 to 18. Under questioning from prosecutors, she said she did so because she was intimidated by him and considered him an “authoritative figure.”
Pozolo said in closing arguments that Kelly ""took advantage of Jane's youth"" for his own ""sick pleasure.""
""She was brave enough to come forward after all these years to tell you what happened,"" Pozolo told jurors in her closing argument.
Kelly's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, previously told jurors that they will have to decide whether they believe the accusers and the witnesses to be credible, pointing out that Jane had previously denied that she was the person in the video with Kelly.",2022-09-12T22:25:03Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
R. Kelly Prosecution Final Words in Child-Pornography Trial,"Photo: E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images
As R. Kelly’s Chicago federal trial neared its end on Monday, September 12, the prosecution presented their closing arguments to the jury, focusing on how Kelly had used his network to allegedly hide that he preyed on minors and produced child pornography that chronicled his sexual abuse. “Kelly and his team — they did their level best … to cover up the fact that Robert Kelly, R. Kelly the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator. They did their best, but in the end, they failed,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo said, per the Chicago Tribune’s Megan Crepeau. “We are here today because those tapes that they concealed for 20 years are no longer their secret. You have seen the tapes.” Pozolo discussed “Jane,” Kelly’s former goddaughter, whom he allegedly abused. Jane, now 37, told jurors on August 18 that Kelly had sexually abused her “hundreds” of times when she was an underage teen. Jane testified that she was the girl in a video with Kelly that spurred his 2008 child-pornography trial in Chicago. She told the jury she was just 14 when the video was recorded — putting Kelly at around 30 years old at the time, according to the Associated Press.
Jane had refused to cooperate in Kelly’s early 2000s trial, so she didn’t testify; several jurors who sat on the case previously explained that this is why they’d found him not guilty. Jane admitted in court that she’d lied to a grand jury in 2002 when she claimed that it wasn’t her on the tape. “I was afraid something bad would happen to Robert,” Jane said during her testimony. “I was protecting him.” Explaining why she’d lied, Jane said: “I also did not want that person to be me” and “I was ashamed.” Jane said that she recently started to talk about what had happened with Kelly, because she “became exhausted living with his lies.” Pozolo repeatedly emphasized Jane’s testimony during her closing. “That child, who had no prior sexual experiences in her life, was forced to lay on that floor while that man sitting right over there urinated on her. That degrading act is forever captured on that video,” Crepeau reported Pozolo saying. “That abuse is forever memorialized … Who does that? Who uses a 14-year-old child to film a video like this? This man. Robert Kelly.”
The “I Believe I Can Fly” singer’s Chicago federal trial — his second trial in a year — started on August 15. Kelly, who was found guilty of racketeering and sex crimes in Brooklyn federal court in September 2021, is charged on counts of child pornography and obstruction of justice. The feds contend that Kelly engaged in sexual acts with five minors, recording some of these encounters on video. Accomplices Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown are on trial alongside Kelly for allegedly helping cover up his purported crimes and sabotaging his prior child-pornography case. The prosecution, Crepeau reported, ended its closing with Pozolo saying, “Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years. He committed horrible crimes against children. And he didn’t do it alone … all these years later, the hidden side of Robert Kelly has come to light. The truth has come out.” Defense closings have begun and may continue on September 13.",2022-09-12T21:38:36Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
"Aanklager in Chicago: R. Kelly is roofdier, uit op ‘ziek plezier’","R. Kelly is een seksueel roofdier die zijn beroemdheid heeft aangewend om minderjarigen te misbruiken. Dat zei de openbaar aanklager volgens Amerikaanse media maandag in de rechtszaak die in Chicago tegen de zanger loopt.
Aanklager Elizabeth Pozolo richtte zich in haar slotpleidooi vooral tegen een van de vermeende slachtoffers van R. Kelly. Pozolo stelde dat R. Kelly ""misbruik heeft gemaakt van de jeugd van Jane"". ""Hij misbruikte haar meerdere malen. Hij verrichtte walgelijke daden op haar, alleen voor zijn eigen zieke plezier.""
Tijdens de zaak werden ook beelden getoond die zijn gemaakt van het misbruik. Jane was toen veertien jaar oud. Behalve van misbruik wordt de zanger ook verdacht van het vervaardigen van kinderporno.
Kelly wordt al sinds de jaren negentig beschuldigd van (kinder)misbruik. Zelf heeft hij altijd gezegd onschuldig te zijn. De zanger, die sinds 2019 vastzit, werd eind juni in New York al schuldig bevonden voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken.",2022-09-12T19:45:14Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen
"R. Kelly 'a sexual predator,' feds say in closing arguments at trial","Disgraced R&B star R. Kelly is nothing but “a sexual predator” who used his fame to prey on underage girls, federal prosecutors argued at the singer’s child pornography trial Monday.
Speaking during closing arguments at the fallen idol’s month-long trial in Chicago, prosecutors cited graphic videos of Kelly abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter — who previously gave damning testimony against him under the name “Jane.”
“That child, who had no prior sexual experiences in her life, was forced to lay on that floor while that man sitting right over there urinated on her,” Assistant US Attorney Elizabeth Pozolo told jurors. “That degrading act is forever captured on that video. That abuse is forever memorialized.
“We are here today because those tapes that they concealed for 20 years are no longer their secret,” Pozolo said. “You have seen the tapes. You have seen what Kelly did to Jane.”
Kelly, 55, and his former business manager, Derrell McDavid, are charged with conspiracy for allegedly undermining the state case against Kelly at a 2008 trial, which ended with the pop star being acquitted, the Chicago Tribune reported. They also face child pornography charges.

The “I Believe I Can Fly” singer and McDavid threatened women and concealed video evidence at the earlier trial to cover up the fact that “R. Kelly … the R&B superstar … is actually a sexual predator,” Pozolo said.
The two scrambled to recover tapes that would have exposed Kelly as a sexual abuser and the Grammy winner was prepared to make six- and seven-figure payments to get them back, the prosecutor said.
“The secret that would ruin Kelly forever if it came out,” she told the jury. “So yes, that secret was worth $1 million.”

Closing arguments heard in trial of singer R Kelly,"SINGER R KELLY is a sexual predator who parlayed his fame to abuse minors, a prosecutor has said during closing arguments at the R&B star’s child pornography (child sexual exploitation material) and trial-fixing trial.
Addressing jurors in a courtroom in Chicago, Kelly’s hometown, Elizabeth Pozol cited one of Kelly’s accusers who was the government’s star witness at the month-long trial.
Referring to the accuser by a pseudonym, Jane, Pozol said Kelly “took advantage of Jane’s youth. He repeatedly abused her. He performed degrading acts upon her for his own sick pleasure”.
She said Kelly and his two co-defendants helped to recover child pornography videos and hid evidence before Kelly’s 2008 trail, at which he was acquitted.
She said they acted to cover up the fact that “R Kelly … the R&B superstar … is actually a sexual predator”.
Minutes before the defence rested late on Friday, Kelly co-defendant and ex-business manager Derrell McDavid ended three days on the stand.
He testified for nearly two days that he had believed Kelly when he denied abusing minors — then said he started having doubts about Kelly’s believability during the trial that started last month.

Both also face child pornography charges. Another co-defendant, Kelly associate Milton Brown, is accused of receiving child pornography.
Prosecutors normally get a chance to call witnesses in a rebuttal of the defence case. But when they told Judge Harry Leinenweber that they needed time to prepare, he said there would be no rebuttal and the case would go straight to closing arguments this morning.
McDavid was the only one of the three defendants to testify on his own behalf.
Kelly (55) was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June after a separate federal trial in New York.
Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct began circulating in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries Surviving R Kelly.

Prosecutor: R. Kelly a predator using fame to abuse minors,"The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly is a sexual predator who parlayed his fame to abuse minors, a prosecutor said Monday during closing arguments at the R&B star's child pornography and trial-fixing trial.
Addressing jurors in a courtroom in Chicago, Kelly’s hometown, Elizabeth Pozolo cited one of Kelly’s accusers who was the government’s star witness at the monthlong trial.

She said they acted to cover up the fact that “R. Kelly … the R&B superstar … is actually a sexual predator.”
Pozolo described in graphic detail the video excerpts jurors saw that she said show Kelly abusing Jane while she calls him “daddy” and refers to herself as being 14 years old. She said Kelly can be seen walking up to the camera to adjust it. Jane testified at trial that she was the teenager in the video.
“That abuse is forever memorialized ...,” Pozolo told jurors, her voice rising. “Who does that? Who uses a 14-year-old child to film a video like this? This man. Robert Kelly.”
Before Kelly’s 2008 trial, Pozolo said Kelly and his associates scrambled to recover sex videos that had gone missing from a collection he often carried around in a large gym bag. More tapes revealing Kelly as a sexual abuser could sink his career and land him in yet more legal trouble, so he was prepared to make six- and seven-figure payments to get them back, Pozolo said.

Prosecutor: R. Kelly predator who used fame to abuse minors,"The singer is charged with fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence.
Example video title will go here for this video
CHICAGO — Jurors were set to begin deliberating for a second day Wednesday at R. Kelly's federal trial in Chicago, sorting through a month of evidence and arguments on charges accusing the singer of producing child pornography, enticing minors for sex and rigging his 2008 child porn trial.
Jurors must consider 13 separate counts, some involving complex law and assessments of which witnesses were more believable. They began deliberating Tuesday after Judge Harry Leinenweber gave them jury instructions, including explicit descriptions of what constitutes sexual abuse.
Before they withdrew Tuesday, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean sounded indignant, likening government testimony and evidence to a cockroach and the government’s case to a bowl of soup.
If a cockroach falls into soup, she said, “you don’t just pull out the cockroach and eat the rest of the soup. You throw out the whole soup,"" said told jurors. She said of the prosecution’s case: “There are just too many cockroaches.”
Kelly, 55, was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison during a separate federal trial in New York where he was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking.
In her rebuttal Tuesday, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng told jurors to remember the girls and women Kelly allegedly abused.
“When you are in the quiet of the jury room, consider the evidence in light of who is at the center of this case. Kelly’s victims: Jane, Nia, Pauline, Tracy and Brittany,” Appenteng said, referring to five Kelly accusers named in charging documents by their pseudonyms or first names.
She said as Kelly's fame boomed in the mid-1990s, his inner circle increasingly geared everything they did to what Kelly wanted.
“And ladies and gentlemen, what R. Kelly wanted was to have sex with young girls,” she said.
Bonjean described Kelly as a flawed genius who has been functional illiterate since childhood and was ill-equipped to navigate his celebrity and expanding wealth. She said having been abused as a child also deeply affected him.
Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct circulated in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly and co-defendant Derrell McDavid, Kelly's ex-business manager, are accused of fixing Kelly's 2008 trial on state child porn charges by intimidating and paying off witnesses.
Kelly faces four counts of producing child porn, one of conspiring to obstruct justice by fixing the 2008 trial, one of conspiring to receive child porn, two of actually receiving it and five of enticing minors for sex.

Article content “Robert Kelly abused many girls over many years,” she said, referring to the 55-year-old Grammy winner’s full first name. “He committed horrible crimes against children. All these years later, the hidden side of Robert Kelly has come out.” Jurors are expected to began deliberating Tuesday after Kelly’s lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, makes her closing argument and prosecutors give a short rebuttal. Bonjean twice called for a mistrial Monday, complaining that closing arguments by attorneys for Kelly co-defendants Derrell McDavid and Milton Brown were grounded in the presumption that “the world now knows Mr. Kelly is a sex predator.”

Article content “The presumption of innocence has been abolished for him,” Bonjean said about Kelly, meaning he was unable to get a fair trial. Judge Harry Leinenweber denied the requests. Known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct began circulating in the 1990s and after his 2008 Illinois trial, at which he was acquitted. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.” Kelly and McDavid, Kelly’s former business manager, are charged with fixing the 2008 trial. Both face child pornography charges. Brown, a former Kelly associate, is accused of receiving child pornography.

Article content Kelly already was sentenced to 30 years in prison after a separate federal trial in New York in June. Convictions on just a few of the 13 counts Kelly faces at his current trial could add years to that. Pozolo, the prosecutor, focused much of her closing argument Monday on a Kelly accuser who went by “Jane” and who was considered the government’s star witness. She testified that Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times starting when she was 14. “He took advantage of Jane’s youth,” Pozolo said about Kelly. “He repeatedly abused her. He performed degrading acts upon her for his own sick pleasure.” Pozolo reminded jurors of graphic video footage they watched earlier at the trial, recordings that Jane testified depicted Kelly, at around age 30, abusing her when she was 14. Among the videos jurors saw was one at the heart Kelly’s 2008 trial. Jurors at that trial said later they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because Jane didn’t testify then.

Article content “That abuse is forever memorialized,” Pozolo told jurors. “Who does that? Who uses a 14-year-old child to film a video like this? This man. Robert Kelly.” Before Kelly’s 2008 trial, Pozolo said, Kelly and his associates scrambled to recover multiple sex videos that had gone missing from a collection he often carried around in a large gym bag. By doing so, she said, Kelly associates sought “to cover up the fact that … R. Kelly, the R&B superstar, is actually a sexual predator.” Pozolo said the fact that Jane and three other Kelly accusers had so much to lose by testifying should give jurors confidence they told the truth on the stand. “They opened up old wounds to tell you what happened to them and who did it to them,” she said.

Article content In his closing, an attorney for McDavid said prosecutors had to show that his client actually knew about any abuse of Jane by Kelly in the 2000s — not just that it was likely he knew. “Did they prove he knew … behind a reasonable doubt?” Beau Brindley asked. “They did not.” Earlier Monday, Pozolo balked at the idea that McDavid had no inkling in the 2000s that the abuse allegations might be credible after helping to recover missing recordings and handing bags of cash to people who returned videos McDavid knew could destroy Kelly. “Really? Does that make any sense?” she said. “It doesn’t make sense.” Also Monday, the judge replaced one juror with an alternate after the panelist reported having a panic attack while listening to closing arguments. McDavid was the only defendant who testified during the trial that started Aug. 15. Combined, lawyers for the three co-defendants called several witnesses over four days, with McDavid on the stand for three. The witnesses mostly gave testimony favorable to all three defendants. But McDavid may have hurt Kelly’s defence by ultimately questioned Kelly’s believability, saying that listening to Kelly accusers testify at the current had altered his views of the singer.

Closing arguments are scheduled Monday for R. Kelly and two co-defendants in the R&B singer’s trial on federal charges of trial-fixing, child pornography and enticing minors for sex, with jury deliberations to follow.
Minutes before the defense rested late Friday, Kelly co-defendant and ex-business manager Derrell McDavid ended three days on the stand. He testified for nearly two days that he had believed Kelly when he denied abusing minors — then said he started having doubts about Kelly’s believability during the trial that started last month.
Kelly and McDavid are charged with fixing Kelly’s 2008 state child pornography trial — at which Kelly was acquitted — by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence. Both also face child pornography charges. A third co-defendant, Kelly associate Milton Brown, is accused of receiving child pornography.
Prosecutors normally get a chance to call witnesses in a rebuttal of the defense case. But when they told Judge Harry Leinenweber that they needed time to prepare, he said there would be no rebuttal and the case would go straight to closing arguments Monday morning.

CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly is a sexual predator who parlayed his fame to abuse minors, a prosecutor said Monday during closing arguments at the R&B star’s child pornography and trial-fixing trial.
Addressing jurors in a 25th floor courtroom in Chicago, Kelly’s hometown, Elizabeth Pozol cited one of Kelly’s accusers who was the government’s start witness at the monthlong trial.
Referring to the accuser by a pseudonym, “Jane,” Pozol said Kelly “took advantage of Jane’s youth. He repeatedly abused her. He performed degrading acts upon her for his own sick pleasure.”
She said Kelly and his two co-defendants helped to recover child pornography videos and hid evidence before Kelly’s 2008 trail, at which he was acquitted.

The defense for R. Kelly and two co-defendants rested Friday at the R&B singer's trial on charges of trial-fixing, child pornography and enticing minors for sex, with closing arguments and the start of jury deliberations scheduled for early next week.
Minutes before resting, Kelly co-defendant and ex-business manager Derrell McDavid ended three days on the stand. He testified for nearly two days that he had believed Kelly when he denied abusing minors — then said he started having doubts about Kelly's believability during the trial that started last month.

McDavid was the only one of the three defendants to testify in his own behalf.
Kelly, 55, already was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June after a separate federal trial in New York.
Known for his smash hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"" and for sex-infused songs such as ""Bump n' Grind,"" Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct began circulating in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries ""Surviving R. Kelly.""
During her cross-examination of McDavid, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng sought to cast doubt on his testimony that, all through the 2000s, he was unaware that the sexual abuse allegations might have some credence.
During Kelly's monthlong trial in 2008, which McDavid attended, state prosecutors played a 30-minute, sexually explicit video dozens of times on large screens throughout the courtroom. Prosecutors said it showed Kelly abusing a 14-year-old girl, ""Jane.""
McDavid initially said he looked away every time the video was played but later conceded that he ""glanced back and forth"" at it, though not long enough to fully assess the content. CBS Chicago reported McDavid testified he looked into the claims about ""Jane"" by speaking with Kelly and his attorney and did not start paying more attention to Kelly's contact with Jane.
Appenteng also questioned McDavid about his claim that he wasn't at a 2001 hotel room meeting with Jane and her parents, where government witnesses said Kelly admitted having sex with Jane, who regarded Kelly as her godfather.
McDavid testified that he drove to the hotel but remained outside in his car. ""It was delicate,"" he added.
""It was delicate,"" the prosecutor shot back, ""because Kelly admits (at the meeting) ... he is having sex with his goddaughter.""
Prosecutors pressed McDavid on if he believed Kelly's accusers were lying because they were asking for money, CBS Chicago reported, but McDavid said that was not the only reason. McDavid also denied those lawsuits were settled to protect Kelly and his own income, though he acknowledged the victims' claims could have severely damaged Kelly's career.
On Thursday, McDavid also denied intimidating anyone leading up to the 2008 trial. His lawyer asked if he ever threatened to kill Kelly's ex-girlfriend Lisa Van Allen for having stolen a sex video from Kelly and for not being forthcoming about it, as she testified earlier.
""I'm an accountant. No,"" he said.
At times, McDavid sounded more like a government witness.
In a sudden shift at the end of his second day of testimony Thursday, he expressed doubts about Kelly's insistence in the 2000s that he never sexually abused minors.
Asked by his own lawyer, Beau Brindley, if he was in ""a different position"" to assess allegations against Kelly after sitting through government testimony by four Kelly accusers, including Jane, McDavid responded: ""Yes, I am.""
""The last (few) weeks … I've learned a lot … that I had no idea about in 2008,"" added McDavid, who previously had testified that he once saw Kelly as a son.
McDavid's testimony could lend credence to the charges Kelly alone faces — five counts of enticing minor girls for sex, one count each for five accusers.
Judge Leinenweber repeatedly rejected requests from Kelly's defense team that he be tried alone because his and McDavid's interests would conflict at a joint trial.
The ongoing trial in Kelly's hometown is, in ways, a do-over of the 2008 trial. The single video was at the heart of that trial and is also in evidence at the current trial.
Jane, then an adult, did not testify at that 2008 trial, which jurors cited as a reason they couldn't convict Kelly. She testified at the current trial that she was the person in that video. She also said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times starting when she was 14.
CBS Chicago reported ""Jane"" said some sex acts started when she was 14 and vaginal sex when she was 15. Threesomes with Kelly and at least two other of his accusers, referred to in court as ""Pinky"" and ""Brittany,"" also started when she was 14, she said in court. Another accuser, ""Tracy,"" testified Kelly started a sexual relationship with her when she was 14, and she had sex with Kelly that sometimes involved other people more than 50 times when she was 17 and 18.",2022-09-10T14:31:10Z,https://www.cbsnews.com,CBS News

On Friday, Federal Judge Ann Donnelly ordered the Federal Bureau Of Prisons to turn over $27,828 from Kelly’s prison commissary account. The funds will be used to pay off fines and restitution for the victims but she requested that the money is deposited into an interest-accruing account until she determines exactly how the funds will be divided.

Judge Donnelly made a point of noting that Kelly has yet to pay any portion of the $150K in court fees and fines that he was ordered during his sentencing. ""The government is entitled to the defendant’s funds because he owes substantial fines,” Donnelly wrote.“I am also mindful of victims’ rights ‘to full and timely restitution.'"" Adding, ""Once restitution is determined by the court, the Clerk of Court should apply the monies held in the interest-bearing account first to the $900 special assessment and then to the restitution judgment.""
According to the NY Post, Kelly's attorneys plan to appeal, as they did when his account was initially frozen. Earlier this year, the Bureau Of Prisons froze the singer's commissary account after he ""accumulated substantial funds in his inmate trust account"" of upwards of $28,328.24, according to prosecutors.
Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June following his conviction in the New York case. He's currently being tried in Chicago for a different case relating to his 2008 child pornography trial.

"R. Kelly Prison Account Will Be Used to Pay Victim Restitution, Judge Rules","R. Kelly is currently on trial in Chicago and New York, and on Friday (September 9), a New York federal judge ruled the prosecution team can seize some of the money held in Kelly’s inmate commissary account to pay court fines and victim restitution, as Billboard and Rolling Stone report.
The R&B vocalist has been ordered to hand over the nearly $30,000 dollars currently in the account, which will be used to cover a $900 court fine. The balance will also be applied to restitution after the court decides how much money Kelly owes the victims. Rolling Stone also notes under the conditions of the ruling, Kelly is allowed to retain $500 for commissary use.
“The defendant has amassed nearly $30,000 dollars in his inmate trust account over the course of the last three years of incarceration,” the prosecution said, per Billboard. “The defendant has not made any payments towards the substantial criminal monetary penalties imposed upon him at sentencing, even though payment was due immediately.”
With her decision, U.S. District Judge Ann M. Donnelly said that the decision was “appropriate,” and that the victims have a right to “full and timely restitution,” Rolling Stone reports.
In September 2021, Kelly was found guilty of racketeering and eight counts of sex trafficking in a Brooklyn court, and was later sentenced to 30 years in prison and required to pay multiple fees.
Kelly’s Chicago trial began in August 2022 after its start date was pushed back from April 2020. During the trial, an anonymous woman came forward and identified herself as the underage girl in the tape shown during Kelly’s 2008 trial, testifying against the musician.

Defense rests at R. Kelly trial on trial-fixing charges,"CHICAGO (AP) — The defense for R. Kelly and two co-defendants rested Friday at the R&B singer’s trial on charges of trial-fixing, child pornography and enticing minors for sex.
They concluded their case after the main defense witness, Kelly co-defendant and former business manager Derrell McDavid, ended three days of testimony.
Prosecutors get a chance to call rebuttal witnesses and the sides will then deliver closing arguments. Jury deliberations aren’t likely to begin until next week.
Kelly and McDavid are charged with fixing Kelly’s 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence. Kelly was acquitted in 2008. Both he and McDavid also face child pornography charges at the federal trial in Chicago. A third co-defendant, Kelly associate Milton Brown, is accused of receiving child pornography.
McDavid was the only one of the three defendants to testify in his own behalf.

Kelly, 55, already was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June after a separate federal trial in New York.
Kelly, known for his smash hit “I Believe I Can Fly” and for sex-infused songs such as “Bump n’ Grind,” sold millions of albums even after allegations of sexual misconduct began circulating in the 1990s. Widespread outrage emerged after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
At times while testifying this week, McDavid sounded like a prosecution witness. He said he believed Kelly’s denials about sexually abusing minors in the 2000s but altered his view during the current trial.
During cross-examination, prosecutor Jeannice Appenteng sought to show McDavid was so close to Kelly that he couldn’t have been completely ignorant of any Kelly misconduct.
McDavid agreed his job included protecting Kelly’s reputation and assets. Citing financial records, the prosecutor said Kelly paid him some $1 million a year starting in 2006. McDavid denied he took steps to fend off sexual misconduct lawsuits against Kelly primarily to protect his his boss and his lucrative income from Kelly.
In a sudden shift at the end of the day Thursday, McDavid expressed doubts about Kelly’s insistence in the 2000s that he never sexually abused minors.
Asked by his own lawyer, Beau Brindley, if he was in “a different position” to assess allegations against Kelly after sitting through government testimony by four Kelly accusers , McDavid responded: “Yes, I am.”

“The last (few) weeks … I’ve learned a lot … that I had no idea about in 2008,” he added.
McDavid, who previously had testified that he once saw Kelly as a son, was also asked if he had wanted to believe Kelly in the 2000s, including to the end of Kelly’s 2008 trial.
“I absolutely did,” he answered, “because I loved him and I believed in him.”
McDavid’s testimony could lend credence to the charges Kelly alone faces — five counts of enticing minor girls for sex, one count each for five accusers. However, it is also in McDavid’s interest to say he believed Kelly heading into the 2008 trial because it undermines the government’s case that McDavid knew Kelly was guilty and thought the singer would be convicted if evidence wasn’t suppressed.
ADVERTISEMENT
Judge Harry Leinenweber has repeatedly rejected requests from Kelly’s defense team that he be tried alone because his and McDavid’s interests would conflict at a joint trial.
McDavid testified that he and Kelly grew apart after the 2008 trial amid financial disputes and that he quit working for Kelly in 2014.
The ongoing trial in Kelly’s hometown is, in ways , a do-over of the 2008 trial. A single video, which prosecutors said showed Kelly sexually abusing a girl of around 14, was at the heart of that trial. The same video is evidence at the current trial.
The girl in the video, then an adult, did not testify at that 2008 trial, which jurors cited as a reason they couldn’t convict. She testified at the current trial under the pseudonym “Jane,” saying she was the person in that video and that Kelly made the recording. She also said that Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of time starting when she was 14.

McDavid testified Wednesday that he had seen the then-teenager hanging around Kelly’s studio in the late 1990s. He said Kelly angrily denied rumors he was sexually abusing Jane, whom Kelly described as his goddaughter.
“I believed him,” McDavid said.

Die zuständige Gefängnisbehörde müsse in den kommenden zehn Tagen einen Scheck über die Summe von 27.828 Dollar (rund 27.700 Euro) an das Gericht ausstellen, legte Richterin Ann Donnelly fest.

Over $27K to be drained from R. Kelly's prison account: judge,"Convicted sex fiend R. Kelly must drain the more than $27,000 he has in his prison commissary account to pay back his victims, a Brooklyn judge ruled Friday.
Federal Judge Ann Donnelly ordered the Bureau of Prisons to turn over $27,828 from Kelly’s inmate trust account in a Chicago lockup to be put in an interest accruing account until she determines how much money should be paid in restitution to his victims.
The BOP froze the money last month after prosecutors noted that Kelly had “accumulated substantial funds in his inmate trust account,” to the tune of $28,328.24.

Kelly’s lawyers argued “that the BOP impermissibly ‘confiscated’ the funds” urging the “immediate return” of the money.
But Donnelly noted in a decision from Friday that Kelly – who was convicted last year in New York of sexually abusing women, girls and boys for decades – still hadn’t paid nearly $150,000 in fines and fees ordered at his sentencing.
“The government is entitled to the defendant’s funds because he owes substantial fines,” Donnelly wrote.

“I am also mindful of victims’ rights ‘to full and timely restitution,'” Donnelly said.
“Once restitution is determined by the court, the Clerk of Court should apply the monies held in the interest-bearing account first to the $900 special assessment and then to the restitution judgment,” Donnelly ordered.
Kelly’s lawyer Jennifer Bonjean told The Post, “we plan to appeal.”
In June, Kelly – whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly – was sentenced to 30 years in prison in the New York case.

"R. Kelly Prison Funds Can Be Seized to Pay Victims, Judge Rules","A New York federal judge ruled Friday that prosecutors could seize tens of thousands of dollars held by R. Kelly in his prison funds account in order to pay fines and restitution to his victims.
The ruling in New York, which came as Kelly is currently standing trial in Chicago over separate criminal charges, ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to hand over $27,824 to prosecutors, who will hold them until a final ruling is issued on how much Kelly owes in restitution.
After decades of accusations of sexual misconduct, Kelly was convicted last year in New York on racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from accusations that he orchestrated a long-running scheme to recruit and abuse women and underage girls. In June, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
The government moved to seize Kelly’s inmate funds after a Washington Post article last month detailed how the Bureau of Prisons was “pushing back” against efforts to make inmates turn over such money to pay their victims. The article reported that such funds generate $80 million per year for the agency, which is used to fund salary and benefits for hundreds of staffers with the bureau.
“The defendant has amassed nearly thirty-thousand dollars in his inmate trust account over the course of the last three years of incarceration,” federal prosecutors argued. “The defendant has not made any payments towards the substantial criminal monetary penalties imposed upon him at sentencing, even though payment was due immediately.”
Faced with that demand, Kelly argued that the government had improperly “confiscated” the funds and did not have the authority to do so. But Judge Ann Donnelly easily rejected those arguments on Friday, saying there was “no dispute” that federal statutes authorized prosecutors to use Kelly’s inmate funds to pay back victims.
Kelly is gearing up to appeal the New York convictions, which could take months or longer. His attorneys have made various arguments challenging the verdict, including sharp critiques of his former legal team and claims that the evidence was too weak to support a conviction.
The Chicago case – which deals with accusations of child pornography and obstruction of justice over Kelly’s infamous video tape from the 2000s – is currently in a fourth week of trial. On Wednesday, his former business manager and co-defendant took the witness stand, testifying that he had “believed” Kelly’s denials of sexual misconduct and thought the allegations were merely “rumors.”
The trial is set to wrap up next week; if convicted, Kelly could face decades more tacked onto his 30-year prison sentence.",2022-09-09T15:57:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
R. Kelly Trial: Ex-Employee Says He Now Doubts Abuse Denials,"An ex-business manager for R. Kelly and his co-defendant at the singer’s federal trial in Chicago expressed doubts on the witness stand Thursday about Kelly’s insistence in the 2000s that he never sexually abused minors — testifying a day after the former employee told jurors he had had no reason to doubt his boss was telling the truth.
Derrell McDavid’s testimony, which could be a major blow to Kelly’s hope of acquittal, came at the end McDavid’s second day on the stand. He and the Grammy winner are charged with successfully fixing Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence. Both also face child pornography charges.
Asked by his own lawyer, Beau Brindley, if he was in “a different position” now as far as assessing allegations against Kelly after sitting through government testimony by four Kelly accusers, McDavid responded solemnly: “Yes, I am.”
“The last (few) weeks … I’ve learned a lot … that I had no idea about in 2008,” he said. When he added that, “as I stand here today, I’m embarrassed… sad,” Kelly’s lead lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, objected. Judge Harry Leinenweber sustained her objection.
McDavid, who said earlier he once saw Kelly as a son, was also asked Thursday if he had wanted to believe Kelly in the 2000s and through to the end of Kelly’s 2008 trial.
It is in McDavid’s interest to say he believed Kelly in much of the 2000s because it undermines the government’s case that McDavid knew Kelly was guilty heading into the 2008 trial and would, if evidence wasn’t suppressed, be convicted.
With jurors out of the courtroom earlier, Bonjean said she was worried McDavid would — as he ended up doing — cast doubt about Kelly’s believability. She said it would unfairly prejudice her client in jurors’ eyes and, on some counts, seal his fate.
Kelly’s defense team has several times asked that Kelly’s trial be severed from McDavid’s and that Kelly be tried alone, saying their interests at a joint trial would inevitably conflict. Leinenweber has repeatedly rejected that request.
Among the charges only Kelly faces at the current trial are five counts of enticing minor girls for sex — one count for five Kelly accusers. McDavid’s testimony toward the end of the day Thursday could potentially lend credence to those accusations.
Prosecutors are set to start what could be a blistering cross-examination of McDavid on Friday. McDavid’s lengthy testimony seemed to open doors for prosecutors to ask him about otherwise barred topics, including evidence entered by state prosecutors at Kelly’s 2008 trial.
Earlier Thursday, McDavid also testified that a push to recover purported Kelly sex videos prior to the 2008 trial was driven, not by himself or Kelly, but by Kelly’s now deceased-criminal lawyer, Ed Genson.
With that testimony, McDavid sought to distance himself from decisions to aggressively pursue videos prior to the 2008 trial, including by offering six-figure payoffs for lost or stolen videos.
The ongoing trial in Kelly’s hometown is, in ways , a do-over of that 2008 trial. A single video, which state prosecutors said showed Kelly sexually abusing a girl of around 14, was at the heart of that trial. The same video is in evidence at the current trial.
The girl in the video, then an adult, did not testify at that 2008 trial, which jurors said at the time was one reason they couldn’t convict Kelly. She did testify at the current trial under the pseudonym, “Jane.”
The otherwise dry, matter-of-fact McDavid sounded emotional for the first time in two days on the stand when asked Thursday how he felt when jurors at the 2008 trial acquitted Kelly on all charges.
“I was happy,” he said, his voice appearing to break.
During one lunch break during McDavid’s testimony, McDavid stood next to Kelly sitting at his defense table — the two chatting amiably.
On Thursday, McDavid told jurors he and Kelly began to grow apart in the years after the 2008 trial, friction between them highlighted by financial disputes. He quit working for Kelly in 2014, he testified.
On Wednesday, McDavid told jurors he had seen Jane when she was a minor hanging around Kelly’s studio in the late 1990s. He said Kelly angrily denied rumors he was sexually abusing Jane, who Kelly described as his god daughter.
“I believed him,” McDavid testified.
Testifying earlier, Jane, now 37, said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of time starting when she was 14. She also said she was the girl in the video at the center of the 2008 trial and entered as evidence at the current trial. She said Kelly produced it.
McDavid is the only one of the three defendants testifying in his own behalf. Both Kelly and Milton Brown, the third co-defendant, told the trial judge last week they would not testify.
This trial follows a separate federal trial in New York, where the 55-year-old Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in June.

Derrel McDavid spent hours on the witness stand this week explaining that he once believed the mounting sexual abuse allegations against his boss, R&B superstar R. Kelly, were nothing more than lies from extortionists out for a payday.
But federal prosecutors turned the tables on McDavid’s third day of testimony Friday, portraying McDavid as the one motivated by money, who engaged in a yearslong conspiracy to cover up Kelly’s sexual misconduct by paying off accusers and keeping the gravy train going.

McDavid knew about the lawsuits alleging Kelly’s sexual misconduct but simply wanted “to pay (the claimants) off, to just give them money, to make them go away,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannice Appenteng asserted during a contentious cross-examination.
“It wasn’t about getting to the truth of the matter, right?” she asked.
Advertisement
McDavid responded that she was misstating his testimony.
“It was about protecting your boss and protecting your pocket,” Appenteng said.
“No, ma’am,” McDavid said. “It was not about my pocket.”
McDavid’s testimony in his own defense lasted nearly 14 hours — the bulk of trial proceedings this week in the case against him, Kelly and another former associate, Milton “June” Brown. They are charged with conspiring to conceal evidence of Kelly’s misdeeds; Kelly is also charged with producing and receiving child pornography.
McDavid left the stand Friday afternoon and took his place at the defense table, taking long, deep breaths. Not long afterward, attorneys for all three defendants rested their cases. McDavid and Kelly, during a short recess, chatted briefly in a conversation that ended with chuckles.
Jurors are expected to hear closing arguments all day Monday and begin deliberations Tuesday morning.
After completing jury instructions Friday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber announced that the prosecutors will get a total of three hours for their closings, including any rebuttal argument, while lawyers for Kelly and McDavid will have an hour and half each.
When Brown’s attorney, Mary Judge, asked for an hour to make her case, Leinenweber quipped, “An hour? You were hardly even mentioned at all. The less you say, the better off you are.” But he granted the request.

In a surprise move late Friday, Leinenweber prevented prosecutors from presenting any witnesses in rebuttal, since they could not immediately bring anyone to the stand Friday afternoon.
Leinenweber is “under pressure” to move things along quickly, he said when prosecutors asked to briefly present witnesses Monday. “Either do it today or not.”
Prosecutors said they were considering calling Barry Hankerson, Kelly’s ex-manager and the uncle of Aaliyah — the R&B ingenue whom Kelly secretly married in 1994 when she was just 15. Leinenweber has repeatedly barred any mention of that relationship during trial, however.
McDavid repeatedly testified he only ever acted at the behest of Kelly’s attorneys, who gave him no indication they ever thought the accusations against Kelly were true. He also mentioned Hankerson often during his marathon testimony, saying he believed the ex-manager was out to ruin Kelly’s career.
Prosecutors on Friday presented McDavid with two letters from Hankerson’s attorney to Kelly’s camp, but McDavid said he did not recognize them, so jurors did not learn anything about their contents. If Hankerson took the stand, prosecutors told the judge, he could discuss the letters.
Given what prosecutors did reveal about the documents, it appears likely that one of them is a letter described to journalist Jim DeRogatis. DeRogatis reported in his 2019 book “Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly” that Hankerson’s attorney confirmed for him a “key passage” of a letter: Hankerson was leaving Kelly’s employ “because he believed Kelly needed psychiatric help for a compulsion to pursue underage girls.”

But Leinenweber said he would not allow anyone to testify in rebuttal if they were not available and ready to go Friday afternoon, so when jurors returned to the courtroom, prosecutors announced they would not be calling further witnesses.
Over his extensive testimony Friday, McDavid continued to say he had no reason to believe Kelly was involved in wrongdoing in the late 1990s and 2000s, when Kelly was repeatedly accused of sexually abusing underage girls. McDavid testified that at the time of Kelly’s 2008 Cook County trial, he believed the tape at the center of the charges was phony, and that Kelly was frequently extorted by liars who were out for a payday.
McDavid’s defense depends in large part on the claim he believed Kelly was actually innocent during the time period of the alleged cover-ups, and that he only ever acted at the behest of all the lawyers and investigators he hired.
On prosecutors’ cross-examination, they noted that the main lawyers and investigator who McDavid said informed his views on Kelly’s innocence are all now dead.
“So you are the only one left to describe what was said and what was not said during those conversations, is that right?” Appenteng asked. McDavid answered no.
And McDavid claimed that even though he attended nearly all of Kelly’s 2008 trial, he did not view the video at the center of the case, saying only that he might have glanced at it but did not view it in full or see any explicit content.

That claim seems far-fetched, given that the video was repeatedly broadcast on multiple screens over the course of the trial.
McDavid was often contentious on the stand, telling the prosecutor repeatedly that he thought she was misrepresenting his previous testimony in her questions. Several times, he had a confused expression cross his face, opened his mouth and closed it, before saying, “I don’t recall.”
At one point, when asked about how much he’d earned in commissions from Kelly’s companies during a particular year, McDavid asked Appenteng if she could total it.
“You’re the accountant. Can you total it?” she joked, prompting jurors and spectators to burst into laughter.
McDavid threw his hands up and smiled, saying, “I don’t have a calculator.”
Appenteng noted that McDavid previously said he didn’t believe Kelly’s accusers in part because they didn’t go to police with their claims. But, she noted, McDavid never called law enforcement when he thought Kelly was being stolen from or extorted by people like prosecution witness Charles Freeman.

“You didn’t call the police on Charles Freeman for his extortion attempt? You didn’t want police to see that tape, the tape that contained child pornography, right?”
“No, ma’am,” McDavid responded. McDavid again repeatedly claimed he did not see any of the video that Kelly’s team recovered.

In a particularly testy exchange, prosecutors also pressed McDavid on whether he was really absent for a crucial meeting at an Oak Park hotel.
Kelly’s goddaughter, known in the trial as “Jane,” has previously testified that at that meeting, Kelly told her parents about their sexual contact. Jane said she could not recall whether McDavid was present. However, her mother “Susan” testified McDavid was there, but said Kelly did not make any admissions of wrongdoing.
McDavid on Friday strenuously denied being present for that meeting, a claim prosecutors sought to cast doubt on. McDavid previously testified that the meeting would involve “delicate” matters.
“It’s delicate because Kelly is admitting to having sex with his goddaughter for the first time, right?” Appenteng asked.
Advertisement
“Oh, my god,” Kelly’s defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean exclaimed.
Leinenweber then sustained an objection before one was even made.
After another question about the meeting, McDavid leaned back in his chair and said directly to Appenteng, “You gotta do better.” He then quickly said, “I’m sorry for saying that,” clamping a hand over his mouth.
Another sharp exchange occurred shortly before the lunch break, when Appenteng asked whether it was true that McDavid had hugged a man after he returned a Kelly sex tape to him in exchange for money. “Huh? No, ma’am,” McDavid said.
“You have to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ not ‘huh.’” Appenteng said.
Toward the end of his direct examination Thursday, McDavid testified that it wasn’t until viewing evidence during the current federal trial that McDavid saw things differently.

“For the last three weeks … I’ve learned a lot of things that I had no idea about in 2008,” McDavid said.
Asked if he wanted to believe Kelly’s claims that his accusers were all liars, McDavid said, “I absolutely did.” When asked why, his voice started to break.

“Because I loved him and I believed in him,” McDavid said. “As I stand here today, I’m embarrassed, sad — ”

On cross-examination Friday, prosecutors asserted McDavid would long ago have been aware of the accusations made by two witnesses who testified at this trial. The two, identified only as Tracy and Nia, made claims that Kelly’s team settled long before this trial. McDavid was even named in a suit filed by Nia, though McDavid said he had no memory of that.
Earlier in the trial, jurors had seen excerpts of three videos purporting to show Kelly having sexual contact with his underage goddaughter, Jane. Defense attorneys have not directly challenged the fact that Kelly and Jane are depicted on the sexually explicit footage.

And prosecutors presented extensive testimony from Jane that Kelly had sexual contact with her “innumerable” times beginning when she was just 14, then pressured her to lie about it.

"The Government Seized $27,828 From R. Kelly's Commissary Account","A federal judge ordered the seizure of R. Kelly's $27,828 in prison commissary on Friday.
The money will be given to victims of his crimes, the order says.
Kelly is serving a 30-year sentence on racketeering and sex-trafficking charges.

A New York state federal judge on Friday granted a request from prosecutors to seize $27,828 from singer R. Kelly's prison commissary after he didn't pay back any of his court fees, court documents show.
Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is serving a 30-year sentence after being convicted in September on racketeering and sex-trafficking charges stemming from a decadeslong practice of recruiting and grooming girls and young women for illegal sex.
When prosecutors requested a seizure of Kelly's prison commissary, Kelly's attorneys responded that his funds could not be seized without first providing notice or showing that he was in default of his payments.
New York federal judge Ann Donnelly rejected Kelly's argument in her order on Friday and said the government was entitled to the $27,828 ""because he owes substantial fines.""
Kelly owes over $140,000 in fines. Judge Donnelly issued a $100,000 fine based on the conviction plus a statutory $40,000 human-trafficking penalty. A restitution hearing is also scheduled for Kelly on September 28, when Donnelly will decide how much Kelly has to pay to his victims.
The order says the BOP must deposit a check of $27,828.24 to the court clerk within 10 days. It will then be put into an interest-bearing account pending the court's determination on a restitution amount that can be given to the victims.
If the money in the account ends up exceeding the amount of restitution ordered, the remaining balance will be applied to Kelly's $140,000 in fines, according to the order.
Donnelly also dismissed Kelly's argument that the Federal Bureau of Prisons unlawfully withheld his money from him in anticipation of the court's decision as having ""no merit,"" according to the document.
Kelly is currently also standing trial in Chicago on additional federal charges of production of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The trial comes 14 years after he was previously acquitted of 14 child pornography charges in Illinois in 2008.",2022-09-09T04:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
Ex-employee testifies he now doubts R. Kelly abuse denials,"CHICAGO (AP) — An ex-business manager for R. Kelly and his co-defendant at the singer's federal trial in Chicago expressed doubts on the witness stand Thursday about Kelly’s insistence in the 2000s that he never sexually abused minors — testifying a day after the former employee told jurors he had had no reason to doubt his boss was telling the truth.
Derrell McDavid's testimony, which could be a major blow to Kelly's hope of acquittal, came at the end McDavid's second day on the stand. He and the Grammy winner are charged with successfully fixing Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence. Both also face child pornography charges.
Asked by his own lawyer, Beau Brindley, if he was in “a different position” now as far as assessing allegations against Kelly after sitting through government testimony by four Kelly accusers, McDavid responded solemnly: “Yes, I am.”
“The last (few) weeks … I’ve learned a lot … that I had no idea about in 2008,” he said. When he added that, “as I stand here today, I’m embarrassed… sad,” Kelly’s lead lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, objected. Judge Harry Leinenweber sustained her objection.
McDavid, who said earlier he once saw Kelly as a son, was also asked Thursday if he had wanted to believe Kelly in the 2000s and through to the end of Kelly's 2008 trial.
“I absolutely did,” he answered, “because I loved him and I believed in him.”
It is in McDavid’s interest to say he believed Kelly in much of the 2000s because it undermines the government’s case that McDavid knew Kelly was guilty heading into the 2008 trial and would, if evidence wasn't suppressed, be convicted.
With jurors out of the courtroom earlier, Bonjean said she was worried McDavid would — as he ended up doing — cast doubt about Kelly’s believability. She said it would unfairly prejudice her client in jurors' eyes and, on some counts, seal his fate.
Kelly’s defense team has several times asked that Kelly’s trial be severed from McDavid’s and that Kelly be tried alone, saying their interests at a joint trial would inevitably conflict. Leinenweber has repeatedly rejected that request.
Among the charges only Kelly faces at the current trial are five counts of enticing minor girls for sex — one count for five Kelly accusers. McDavid's testimony toward the end of the day Thursday could potentially lend credence to those accusations.
Prosecutors are set to start what could be a blistering cross-examination of McDavid on Friday. McDavid's lengthy testimony seemed to open doors for prosecutors to ask him about otherwise barred topics, including evidence entered by state prosecutors at Kelly’s 2008 trial.
Earlier Thursday, McDavid also testified that a push to recover purported Kelly sex videos prior to the 2008 trial was driven, not by himself or Kelly, but by Kelly’s now deceased-criminal lawyer, Ed Genson.
With that testimony, McDavid sought to distance himself from decisions to aggressively pursue videos prior to the 2008 trial, including by offering six-figure payoffs for lost or stolen videos.
The ongoing trial in Kelly's hometown is, in ways , a do-over of that 2008 trial. A single video, which state prosecutors said showed Kelly sexually abusing a girl of around 14, was at the heart of that trial. The same video is in evidence at the current trial.
The girl in the video, then an adult, did not testify at that 2008 trial, which jurors said at the time was one reason they couldn't convict Kelly. She did testify at the current trial under the pseudonym, ""Jane.""
The otherwise dry, matter-of-fact McDavid sounded emotional for the first time in two days on the stand when asked Thursday how he felt when jurors at the 2008 trial acquitted Kelly on all charges.
“I was happy,” he said, his voice appearing to break.
During one lunch break during McDavid’s testimony, McDavid stood next to Kelly sitting at his defense table — the two chatting amiably.
On Thursday, McDavid told jurors he and Kelly began to grow apart in the years after the 2008 trial, friction between them highlighted by financial disputes. He quit working for Kelly in 2014, he testified.
On Wednesday, McDavid told jurors he had seen Jane when she was a minor hanging around Kelly’s studio in the late 1990s. He said Kelly angrily denied rumors he was sexually abusing Jane, who Kelly described as his god daughter.
“I believed him,” McDavid testified.
Testifying earlier, Jane, now 37, said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of time starting when she was 14. She also said she was the girl in the video at the center of the 2008 trial and entered as evidence at the current trial. She said Kelly produced it.
McDavid is the only one of the three defendants testifying in his own behalf. Both Kelly and Milton Brown, the third co-defendant, told the trial judge last week they would not testify.
This trial follows a separate federal trial in New York, where the 55-year-old Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in June.

le journaliste et animateur Jim DeRogatis n'aura pas à témoigner,"Un critique musical qui a passé des années à sensibiliser le public aux allégations d’inconduite sexuelle contre R. Kelly ne sera pas tenu de témoigner lors du procès fédéral du chanteur de R&B accusé d’avoir produit de la pornographie juvénile et d’avoir tenté de truquer son procès en 2008, a décidé un juge mercredi.
Les avocats de Jim DeRogatis, qui a publié en 2019 le livre « Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly », ont invoqué des protections juridiques pour la presse dans un dossier mardi demandant au juge de district Harry Leinenweber d’annuler une citation à comparaître de la défense pour M. DeRogatis cette semaine. M. DeRogatis était reporter pour le « Chicago Sun-Times » au début des années 2000 lorsqu’il a reçu anonymement une bande vidéo qu’il a donnée à la police et qui était au c?ur du procès pour pornographie juvénile de R. Kelly en 2008 devant un tribunal d’État. Les procureurs allèguent maintenant que R. Kelly a payé la fille dans cette vidéo afin qu’elle ne témoigne pas lors de ce procès, au cours duquel il a été acquitté.
Les avocats de l’ancien directeur commercial de R. Kelly, Derrel McDavid, qui, avec le chanteur, est accusé de complot en vue de truquer ce procès, ont assigné M. DeRogatis à témoigner. L’avocat de M. McDavid, Beau Brindley, a déclaré mercredi au juge que sa seule question pour M. DeRogatis serait de savoir si la copie physique de la vidéo que M. DeRogatis a reçue il y a deux décennies est la même que celle enregistrée comme preuve lors du procès en cours. Les avocats de R. Kelly auraient également pu interroger M. DeRogatis. La défense a précédemment soulevé des questions sur la manipulation des preuves vidéo contre R. Kelly, si les images étaient des originaux ou des copies, et si les vidéos avaient pu être falsifiées. Connaître la chaîne de possession des preuves est essentiel pour établir leur authenticité.
Mais le juge Leinenweber a déclaré que l’authenticité des preuves vidéo avait été établie, notamment grâce aux témoignages d’enquêteurs qui avaient reçu des images de M. DeRogatis et des accusatrices de R. Kelly qui sont apparues dans des vidéos que la vedette du R&B aurait enregistrées. « Je ne vois aucune raison d’appeler M. DeRogatis à la barre », a affirmé le juge, qui a indiqué au co-animateur de l’émission de radio publique « Sound Opinions » qu’il pouvait quitter la salle d’audience. R. Kelly est également accusé d’avoir incité des filles mineures à avoir des relations sexuelles. Les procureurs du procès fédéral dans la ville natale de R. Kelly ont terminé de présenter leur preuve la semaine dernière et la défense pourrait conclure d’ici la fin de cette semaine. Ce procès fait suite à un procès fédéral distinct à New York, dans le cadre duquel R. Kelly a écopé de 30 ans de prison en juin.
M. DeRogatis a pris la parole lors du procès d’État de R. Kelly en 2008, mais a refusé de répondre aux questions, citant une loi de l’Illinois qui protège les droits des journalistes, ainsi que les droits de la liberté de la presse et le droit contre l’auto-incrimination dans la Constitution.

R. Kelly co-defendant to continue testimony Thursday,"R. Kelly is seen in a courtroom sketch during his federal trial on Aug. 19, 2022, at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. (Cheryl Cook)
R. Kelly’s former business manager and current co-defendant is expected to continue his testimony at their federal trial Thursday, when prosecutors could have a chance to cross-examine him about his claims that he never participated in any kind of conspiracy to cover up Kelly’s sexual abuse of young girls.
Derrel McDavid testified in his own defense for about four hours Wednesday, and after the jury left for the day, his attorney Beau Brindley said they were only about halfway done with direct examination.

On the stand Wednesday, McDavid said he came to believe early on that Kelly’s many accusers were merely liars looking for a payday. So when rumors surfaced about a videotape depicting Kelly sexually abusing his teenage goddaughter, “Jane,” McDavid said he believed the singer, who said he “couldn’t believe anybody would make up this kind of a rumor about his goddaughter.”

McDavid’s defense against conspiracy charges depends in part on his claim that he truly believed Kelly to be innocent at the time of the alleged cover-up, and that he merely followed the advice of more experienced attorneys and investigators.

His testimony also provided a counterpoint to that of prosecution witness Charles Freeman, who told jurors Kelly’s team hired him to recover incriminating video footage while Kelly was under investigation.

But Freeman was actually the one who approached Kelly’s associates, in an attempt to extort them with a video that turned out to be nothing but a fuzzy VHS tape of Kelly with an unidentifiable woman, McDavid testified.
Kelly, 55, faces an indictment charging him with 13 counts of production of child pornography, conspiracy to produce child pornography and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Also charged are McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, who are accused in an alleged scheme to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and to hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.

An R. Kelly fan who has been posting videos about the disgraced singer’s ongoing criminal trial was arrested by Chicago police Thursday after another fan accused her of assault.
Sylvia Park Tumusime, 55, of Covington, Georgia, was charged with one misdemeanor count of battery, according to Chicago police.

According to police, the alleged victim, a 45-year-old woman, reported she had been assaulted by a woman she knows about 6:15 a.m. Wednesday in the 100 block of North State Street. The victim said she was walking back to her parked vehicle when Tumusime approached and struck her on the left side of the face. The victim declined treatment at the scene, according to police.
About 7:30 a.m. Thursday, the victim contacted police, saying she saw her assailant outside the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in the 200 block of South Dearborn Street, where Kelly’s trial was about to get underway for the day.

“Officers responded, at which time the offender was placed into custody,” police said in a statement to the Tribune.
Tumusime is a well-known vlogger who posts commentary on Kelly’s case under the YouTube moniker “Infamous Sylvia.” She could not immediately be reached for comment.
The woman who made the assault report, meanwhile, was ticketed with a misdemeanor this morning for failing to adhere to the courthouse’s signs restricting use of recording devices.
The incident was one of several where attendees of Kelly’s trial on child pornography and obstruction charges have been accused of misbehavior.
At least two attendees of the Kelly trial have been issued tickets for failing to follow courthouse rules since the case began last month, according to the U.S. Marshals Service.

R. Kelly ex-manager says he believed singer's abuse denials,"Michael Tarm, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - Singer R. Kelly's former business manager told jurors Wednesday he believed the singer's denials of sexual misconduct that emerged against his boss, adding that he came to understand that fending off false claims was a cost of doing business for a superstar.
Derrell McDavid, a co-defendant at Kelly's child pornography and trial-fixing trial in federal court in Chicago, said he saw no early signs Kelly sought minors for sex, blaming Kelly enemies and those hoping to profit off his fame for concocting the allegations.
Prosecutors ended their two week presentation to jurors before the Labor Day holiday, which included the testimony of four Kelly accusers who described him as a master manipulator.
McDavid and Kelly both face charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice that accuse them of rigging Kelly's 2008 trial, at which the R&B star was acquitted. A third co-defendant, former Kelly associate Milton Brown, faces one charge - conspiracy to receive child pornography.
McDavid told jurors he had seen the prosecution's star witness - referred to by the pseudonym “Jane” at the current trial - when she was a minor hanging around Kelly's studio in the late 1990s. He said Kelly angrily denied rumors that he was sexually abusing Jane, who Kelly described as his god daughter.
“I believed him,” McDavid testified.
McDavid spoke in a dry, matter-of-fact manner from the witness stand for more than four hours Wednesday. Before the trial resumed after a lunch break, McDavid stood at the Kelly defense table and spoke amiably with his former employer.
Testifying earlier for prosecutors, Jane, now 37, said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of time starting when she was 14. She also said she was the girl in a child pornography video at the center of the 2008 trial and entered as evidence at the current trial. She said Kelly produced it.
McDavid is the only one of the three defendants testifying in his own behalf. Both Kelly and Brown told the trial judge last week they would not testify.
This federal trial in Kelly's hometown of Chicago follows a separate federal trial in New York, where the 55-year-old Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in June.
McDavid, who said he came to see Kelly as a son after he started to work for the budding star in the early '90s, portrayed Kelly as a once-in-a-lifetime talent who, shy and humble as a younger man, struggled to cope with booming fame and fortune.
Success, he told jurors, began to change Kelly.
“As he (rose to) superstardom, he started to act like most superstars,” he said. McDavid added: “When I first met him, he was shy around women.” The now-famous Kelly, he said, started to embrace the attention of women wherever he went, sometimes paying for women's flights to see him in Chicago.

Judge: Music writer need not testify at R. Kelly trial,"Lawyers for Jim DeRogatis, middle, invoked legal protections for the press in a filing asking U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber to quash a defense subpoena that DeRogatis testify.Kiichiro Sato/The Associated Press
A music writer who spent decades raising awareness about sexual misconduct allegations against R. Kelly won’t be required to testify at the R&B singer’s federal trial on child pornography and trial-fixing charges, a judge ruled Wednesday.
Lawyers for Jim DeRogatis, who in 2019 released the book “Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly,” invoked legal protections for the press in a Tuesday filing asking U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber to quash a defence subpoena that DeRogatis testify this week.
DeRogatis was a reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times in the early 2000s when he anonymously received a videotape that he gave to police and that was central to Kelly’s child pornography trial in 2008 in state court. Prosecutors now allege he paid off the girl in that tape so she would not testify at his 2008 trial, in which he was acquitted.
Lawyers for Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, who with Kelly is charged with a conspiracy to rig that trial, subpoenaed DeRogatis to testify. McDavid lawyer Beau Brindley told the judge Wednesday that his sole question for DeRogatis would be whether the physical video DeRogatis received two decades ago is the same one entered as evidence at the current trial.
Kelly’s lawyers also would have been able to question DeRogatis.
The defence previously raised questions about who handled the video evidence against Kelly, whether the footage was originals or copies, and whether the videos could have been tampered with. Knowing the chain of custody of evidence is key to establishing its authenticity.
But Leinenweber said the authenticity of the video evidence was established, including through testimony from investigators who received footage from DeRogatis and from Kelly accusers who appeared in videos prosecutor alleged the R&B star recorded.
“I don’t see any basis to call Mr. DeRogatis,” said the judge, who told the co-host of the public radio show “Sound Opinions” that he could leave the courtroom.
Kelly also faces charges of enticing minors for sex. Both McDavid and Kelly also face pornography charges.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Kelly’s hometown rested last week and the defence could wrap up by the end of this week. This trial follows a separate federal one in New York, where Kelly, 55, was sentenced to 30 years in June.
DeRogatis took the stand at Kelly’s 2008 state trial, but refused to answer questions, citing an Illinois law that shields reporters’ rights, as well the U.S. Constitution’s free press rights and right against self-incrimination.

"Tevin Campbell Believes R. Kelly Would Be Suitable ""Verzuz"" Match For Usher","After having a monumental moment with Usher on stage, Tevin Campbell is adding his name to the ""King of R&B"" conversation. Campbell is an icon whose songs have remained cultural favorites for decades and he continues to perform his classics across the globe. He has earned favor among his peers, including Usher who brought Campbell on stage for an unforgettable rendition of ""Can We Talk.""
""We're all kings, man. We're all kings,"" Campbell told TMZ when they asked if Usher was the King of R&B. ""Everybody's a king, everybody's a prince. The original kings, we owe it to them. You know, Sam Cooke and Donny Hathaway, and Marvin Gaye. Those are the kings, but we're all kings.""
The TMZ cameraperson attempted to dig a little further, but Campbell wanted to avoid any controversial answers.
""All I know is Usher's great, man,"" the singer said with a laugh. ""He's a great artist, but we can all be kings and be great at what we do and still co-exist as kings."" The cameraperson mentioned that Usher suggested no one could battle him on Verzuz, but Campbell offered up an opponent.
""R. Kelly,"" he answered. ""[He] has a lot of hits and he wrote all of them... When I think of an R&B artist that's had a lot of hits, I think of R. Kelly, and not only his hits, he's written for so many other people, you know."" He added that he loves Verzuz, but he ""just doesn't believe in the competition.""

R. Kelly ex-manager says he believed singer’s abuse denials,"Prosecutors ended their two week presentation to jurors before the Labor Day holiday, which included the testimony of four Kelly accusers who described him as a master manipulator.
Derrell McDavid, a co-defendant at Kelly’s child pornography and trial-fixing trial in federal court in Chicago, said he saw no early signs Kelly sought minors for sex, blaming Kelly enemies and those hoping to profit off his fame for concocting the allegations.
CHICAGO (AP) — Singer R. Kelly’s former business manager told jurors Wednesday he believed the singer’s denials of sexual misconduct that emerged against his boss, adding that he came to understand that fending off false claims was a cost of doing business for a superstar.

McDavid and Kelly both face charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice that accuse them of rigging Kelly’s 2008 trial, at which the R&B star was acquitted. A third co-defendant, former Kelly associate Milton Brown, faces one charge — conspiracy to receive child pornography.
McDavid told jurors he had seen the prosecution’s star witness — referred to by the pseudonym “Jane” at the current trial — when she was a minor hanging around Kelly’s studio in the late 1990s. He said Kelly angrily denied rumors that he was sexually abusing Jane, who Kelly described as his god daughter.

McDavid spoke in a dry, matter-of-fact manner from the witness stand for more than four hours Wednesday. Before the trial resumed after a lunch break, McDavid stood at the Kelly defense table and spoke amiably with his former employer.
Testifying earlier for prosecutors, Jane, now 37, said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of time starting when she was 14. She also said she was the girl in a child pornography video at the center of the 2008 trial and entered as evidence at the current trial. She said Kelly produced it.

McDavid is the only one of the three defendants testifying in his own behalf. Both Kelly and Brown told the trial judge last week they would not testify.
This federal trial in Kelly's hometown of Chicago follows a separate federal trial in New York, where the 55-year-old Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in June.
McDavid, who said he came to see Kelly as a son after he started to work for the budding star in the early ’90s, portrayed Kelly as a once-in-a-lifetime talent who, shy and humble as a younger man, struggled to cope with booming fame and fortune.
Success, he told jurors, began to change Kelly.
“As he (rose to) superstardom, he started to act like most superstars,” he said. McDavid added: “When I first met him, he was shy around women.” The now-famous Kelly, he said, started to embrace the attention of women wherever he went, sometimes paying for women's flights to see him in Chicago.
When McDavid’s lawyer, Beau Brindley, interrupted to ask if he was referring to girls ages 13 and 14, McDavid said no.
“Grown women,” he answered.
As more rumors began to circulate about Kelly’s possible misconduct and as the first accusers came forward around 2000, McDavid said he didn’t believe them.
McDavid said the lesson he learned from one litigator who represented Kelly in an early lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct was that it’s better for stars to settle suits — even if settling them makes them appear guilty.

“Even a rumor of something like this getting out could hurt your client — even if it is not true,” McDavid said, citing what the lawyer explained to him.

co-defendant takes the stand Wednesday,"R. Kelly is seen in a courtroom sketch during his federal trial on Aug. 19, 2022, at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. (Cheryl Cook)
R&B superstar R. Kelly had already been the target of several lawsuits alleging sexual misconduct when he told his then-business manager in December 2000 that police were harassing his teenage goddaughter about whether they’d been having an inappropriate relationship.
The business manager, Derrel McDavid, told a federal jury Wednesday that when he asked if the allegation regarding the girl was true, the singer exploded.

“‘Are you out your goddamn mind?’” Kelly said according to McDavid, who puffed out his chest and spoke loudly for effect. “‘This is my goddaughter! Of course there’s no truth to this.’”
McDavid said Kelly was convinced that the girl’s aunt, Stephanie “Sparkle” Edwards, and his former personal manager, Barry Hankerson, who each had axes to grind against Kelly, were behind it. Police later interviewed the goddaughter, “Jane,” and her family, who denied it all, he said.

Even after rumors surfaced a year later about a videotape depicting Kelly sexually abusing Jane, McDavid said he believed the singer.
McDavid, who is charged with participating in a wide-ranging cover-up scheme to bury evidence of Kelly sexually abusing underage girls, took the witness stand on the 15th day of trial at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. His defense hinges in part on his claim that he truly believed Kelly to be innocent at the time of the alleged cover-up, and that he merely followed the advice of more experienced attorneys and investigators.
It’s a rare and risky move for a criminal defendant in federal court, and prosecutors are expected to cross-examine McDavid at length on Thursday.
Jurors have already heard from Kelly’s goddaughter, who testified under the pseudonym Jane, that Kelly had sexual contact with her “innumerable” times beginning when she was just 14, then pressured her to lie about it. And they’ve seen excerpts from videos that McDavid allegedly conspired to recover before they wound up in the hands of law enforcement, including one where Kelly allegedly instructs Jane to refer to her “14-year-old” genitalia.
But on questioning from his own attorney Wednesday, McDavid painted a different picture. Dressed in a gray suit and light blue tie, McDavid, 61, was conversational and animated on direct examination, offering slight smiles and sometimes heavy sighs while describing the excitement and frustration of managing Kelly’s meteoric rise.
At one point, when describing how Kelly was a rare “self-contained” star who could do it all, McDavid gestured toward Kelly across the room, saying he could “sit right there at that table and produce a song.”
McDavid said he also saw a darker side to Kelly’s fame. Once the money started rolling in, McDavid said, Kelly was besieged by lying young women who were out for a payday and bitter former associates like Edwards and Hankerson. That’s why he didn’t believe it when rumors surfaced that Kelly was abusing his teenage goddaughter, he said
“Every statement, every report, every lawyer’s letter, all said the same thing: She denied it. Her parents denied it,” he said. Asked what impact that had on Kelly’s strenuous denials, McDavid paused.

“I believed him,” McDavid said.
The idea that bad actors were shaking down Kelly was reinforced in 2001 when a Kansas City man, Charles Freeman, reached out to Kelly’s entertainment attorney, Gerald Margolis, demanding money in exchange for returning a purported sex tape, McDavid said.
Freeman previously testified that McDavid offered a million dollars for the return of the tape, which prosecutors allege contained graphic scenes of Kelly sexually abusing Jane. Freeman also said McDavid was present at meetings in Kansas City where he was issued polygraph tests to determine if he’d made copies.
McDavid described Freeman, a former merchandiser for Kelly, as a “low-level T-shirt guy” and street criminal who couldn’t be trusted.
When asked if Kelly’s team would have hired Freeman to seek out a videotape, as Freeman has testified the arrangement occurred, McDavid shook his head and scowled.
“I wouldn’t have hired him to shine my shoes,” McDavid said, his brow furrowed. “He was just a bad person with a bad vibe.”

McDavid said Margolis hired famed private investigator Jack Palladino to investigate and ultimately pay Freeman $140,000 for the return of the tape and any copies. McDavid flatly denied ever offering $1 million to Freeman, and said he was not even in Kansas City when Freeman said they’d met.
McDavid said Palladino called him in the middle of the night in August 2001 to tell him the tape had been obtained from Freeman. It appeared to be a recording of Kelly and an unknown woman, not a minor.
“He said the tape was a copy,” McDavid testified. “He could make out Mr. Kelly. The tape was of very poor quality. He couldn’t tell who the woman on the tape was.”
McDavid said he later became aware of lots of other sex tapes with Kelly on them, including one depicting the singer and his wife, another featuring one of his backup dancers, and a third that showed Kelly with a famous baseball player’s wife.
“Then there were some other tapes that were supposed to be fakes,” McDavid testified.
But it wasn’t until December 2001 that the first rumor began circulating about a tape that showed Kelly and Jane, McDavid said. He said he knew Jane as Kelly’s goddaughter and had seen her at Kelly’s Near West Side recording studio. McDavid said that before the rumors of the tape surfaced, Kelly had asked him to arrange the purchase of a used PT Cruiser for Jane for her 16th birthday.

McDavid said Kelly was “pissed off” about the situation because he “couldn’t believe anybody would make up this kind of a rumor about his goddaughter.” When McDavid asked him if it was true, Kelly again reacted in anger.
“F--- you. This is my goddaughter,” McDavid quoted Kelly as saying. “Don’t ever question me about this again.”
But others in Kelly’s camp went into crisis mode. When told of the rumor about Jane, Margolis said Kelly should meet with her parents to get ahead of the situation before it hit the media, according to McDavid’s testimony. Margolis also advised Kelly to hire a criminal defense lawyer, he said.
“Now there was a particular issue about a specific person who was underage on a tape,” McDavid said. “We had to take that seriously. Enough was enough.”
McDavid said he set up the meeting with Kelly and Jane and her family in a hotel in Oak Park. On the drive there, Kelly was “slightly apprehensive” and angry about the situation, McDavid said.
“He was concerned about the family being hurt by the media,” McDavid told the jury.

Jane testified last month that she went with her parents to the hotel, where Kelly spoke privately with her father. After a while, her father stormed away furious, and told her mother “it was true” about their relationship.
Kelly followed behind, “begging for his forgiveness and saying not to turn on him,” Jane testified. The singer dropped to his knees, grabbed his head and apologized profusely, Jane said.
Jane said she could not remember whether McDavid was present for the meeting.
In his direct testimony, McDavid said he waited in the car. Afterward, Kelly seemed relieved, saying he’d spoken to Jane’s father and “told him the situation” and that the father had “understood.”
Kelly never told McDavid that he’d gave any kind of “confession” at the meeting, McDavid said.
McDavid’s belief that the allegations against Kelly were orchestrated stemmed from the very first public claim against Kelly, he said, which came from Tiffany Hawkins in the late 1990s. Hawkins sued Kelly, accusing him of having sexual contact with her when she was underage, and Kelly ultimately settled the suit for $250,000.

But, McDavid said, Hawkins’ original claim alleged that he had impregnated her — which Kelly strenuously denied, saying he would take a paternity test. That claim was later dropped, which made McDavid suspicious that she was not being truthful, he testified.
Kelly’s attorney at the time, Margolis, said he would prove her a liar but that they would still settle, which McDavid found confusing. But “this is the way it goes,” Margolis told him, according to McDavid.
McDavid scrunched his face in apparent disgust as he talked about women making stories up for “a payday,” at one point exhaling sharply and shaking his head as he described Hawkins in particular as “on some kind of bulls--t.”

But before jurors were brought in Wednesday morning, Judge Harry Leinenweber ruled on a hot-button request involving journalist Jim DeRogatis, a former Chicago Sun-Times critic who was anonymously mailed a copy of a videotape allegedly showing Kelly with Jane, leading to the singer’s indictment on child pornography charges in Cook County in 2002.
McDavid’s attorneys said they wanted to call DeRogatis strictly to cast doubt on the chain of custody for one of the tapes at issue — not to ask him about confidential sources or any other tricky topics. But Leinenweber had already ruled weeks ago that chain-of-custody issues were not relevant, and so there was no basis to call DeRogatis to testify, the judge said.
On Tuesday, the eve of McDavid’s expected testimony, Kelly’s defense attorneys also filed paperwork asking the judge to prohibit McDavid from testifying about certain topics that they fear could unfairly prejudice the jury against Kelly — including any testimony “related to McDavid taking Kelly to get injections or any treatment to curb his sexual appetite.”

The judge said he would rule on those issues as they came up in McDavid’s questioning.
McDavid, a certified public accountant, began his more than four hours on the witness stand Wednesday by telling jurors about his first encounter with Kelly, long before he became a superstar.
He first heard about Kelly in the 1980s, when a high school friend from Kenwood Academy walked into a card game and said he had just signed a group called R. Kelly and Public Announcement.
“He was positive that R. Kelly was going to be a big player in the music industry,” McDavid said, swiveling in his chair and sometimes pausing to sip from a bottle of water.
A few years later, McDavid met with Kelly about becoming his accountant.
“The first words out of Robert’s mouth was, ‘Have you heard my music?’ And I said, ‘No, I haven’t.’ He kind of looked down on the floor like he was a little bit disappointed,” McDavid said.

At that time, Kelly was introverted and “humble,” McDavid said. “He was just trying to get in the music business and make it.”

But he warmed to McDavid during their first meeting, he testified, eventually asking: “So you the guy who’s gonna handle my money?”
“I said yes,” McDavid said. “He smiled. That was the extent of our conversation.”
In the years to come Kelly became a bona fide superstar, McDavid said, and became “self-contained” — that is, he could write, play instruments and produce, he said.
McDavid recalled listening to a country music radio station with his wife, and in the middle of the country music, a song from Kelly’s debut solo album “12Play” came on.
“On a country station!” McDavid said. “I glanced over to my wife and said, ‘Looks like he’s made it.’”

R. Kelly Chicago Trial: Music Writer Fighting Subpoena to Testify,"A music writer who spent decades raising awareness about sexual misconduct allegations against R. Kelly is fighting a bid to force him to testify at the R&B singer’s federal trial on child pornography and trial-fixing charges, according to a Tuesday court filing.

Lawyers for Jim DeRogatis, who in 2019 released his book Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly, invoked constitutional and other protections for the press in asking Judge Harry Leinenweber to rule that DeRogatis need not testify.
DeRogatis was a reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times in the early 2000s when he anonymously received a video that he gave to police that helped lead to Kelly’s child pornography trial in 2008 in state court. Video evidence entered at that 2008 trial is also part of the current trial.
Lawyers for Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, who with Kelly is charged with a conspiracy to rig that 2008 child pornography trial, subpoenaed DeRogatis to testify. Kelly’s lawyers also would be able to question DeRogatis if he takes the stand.
Kelly, who was acquitted in the 2008 state trial, also faces charges of enticing minors for sex at the federal trial in the Grammy Award winner’s hometown. Both McDavid and Kelly also face pornography charges.
The trial was scheduled to resume Wednesday — after the Labor Day holiday and after the unexpected closure of the courthouse Tuesday due to “operational issues.” Leinenweber is expected to decide Wednesday morning about whether DeRogatis, who co-hosts the public radio show “Sound Opinions,” will have to testify.
Prosecutors rested last week and the defense could wrap up by the end of this week. The trial follows a separate federal trial in New York, where Kelly, 55, was sentenced to 30 years in June.
It’s not clear what defense lawyers at Kelly’s current trial would ask DeRogatis. But in filings and public statements they raised chain-of-custody questions about how video evidence got into police hands. They also say there were indications DeRogatis shared a draft of his book about Kelly with prosecutors.
Tuesday’s filing, also submitted on behalf of The New Yorker magazine, for whom DeRogatis writes, points to rulings by a Chicago-based U.S. appellate court that forcing reporters to testify in cases they’ve covered should be done rarely and only when there are no alternatives to introducing the same information.
The filing says a Chicago police detective already testified for the prosecution to explain the chain of custody of video evidence. It says another key government witness, using the pseudonym “Jane” also testified that she and Kelly were the people in several video excerpts.
Calling the outspoken Kelly critic to testify could amount to “harassment or intimidation,” given that there are other ways to work the same facts into evidence, the filing argues. It also cites reports that a window at the DeRogatis family home was shot out after the Sun-Times reported on Kelly.
Four years ago, Kelly released a song called “I Admit,” in which he sought to call out the writer, singing: “To Jim DeRogatis, whatever your name is/You been tryna destroy me for 25 whole years.” Kelly described himself as “so falsely accused” but added, “I admit I have made some mistakes/And I have some imperfect ways.”
DeRogatis took the stand at Kelly’s 2008 trial, but refused to answer questions, citing an Illinois law that shields reporters’ rights, as well the U.S. Constitution’s free press rights and right against self-incrimination.",2022-09-07T00:51:59Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

Lakeview home once owned by R. Kelly sells for $2.9M,"A five-bedroom, 8,400-square-foot brick house in Lakeview that disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly owned from 1994 until 2002 sold on Friday for $2.9 million.
Once used as a cigarette vending machine business, the mansion was converted to a single-family residence by a commodities trader in the 1980s. It had been on the market for almost two years, and it has had several owners since Kelly — who paid $1.10 million for it in 1994 and sold it in 2002 for $2.25 million. Kelly, who is currently facing federal child pornography and obstruction of justice charges, sold it in 2002 to Peak6 Capital founder Matthew Hulsizer, who then sold it in 2005 for $2.4 million. The home sold again for $3 million in 2006, and then it sold for just $1 million in 2008 after a foreclosure.

The sellers paid $2.74 million for it in 2011. They first listed it for $3.99 million in October 2020, and they cut their asking price to $3.49 million in January, followed by subsequent price cuts to $3.25 million and $2.99 million.
Built in 1905, the house was renovated between 2017 and 2019 and has 5½ bathrooms, a 50-foot-wide interior, a nearly 30-foot ceiling on the main level, an indoor swimming pool, a 3,000-square-foot roof deck, an elevator serving all levels, a theater, an exercise center with a steam room and a sauna, and a kitchen with Wolf, Miele and Gaggenau appliances. The primary bedroom suite has a nearly 300-square-foot walk-in closet and a bathroom with an oversize steam shower and heated floors, while the roof level has a Kalamazoo grill, a pizza oven, bar seating and a covered seating area for 10.
Advertisement
“It’s a rare combination of raw square footage and unique detail, including an indoor pool right off the living room,” listing agent Mario Greco of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Chicago told Elite Street. “Houses like this are uncommon. It’s singular in every respect.”
During Kelly’s ownership of the house, it had a 1,500-gallon shark-filled aquarium and a marble chessboard embedded in the floor. Those features have been removed.
Kelly was convicted last year in Brooklyn of racketeering and violations of the Mann Act and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison, and he currently is on trial in Chicago federal court on charges of producing child pornography, conspiracy to produce child pornography and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
After Kelly sold the Lakeview house, he moved to a 20,000-square-foot mansion that he built on 7 acres in Olympia Fields. It was in the Olympia Fields mansion where Kelly has been accused of having made a sex tape with an underage girl. He was acquitted in 2008 of the original charges stemming from that tape. He sold the Olympia Fields mansion in 2013 to R&B singer-songwriter Rudolph Isley.
The Lakeview house had a $56,939 property tax bill in the 2020 tax year. Public records do not yet identify the buyers.

Chicago’s federal courthouse to reopen Wednesday after closure,"The Dirksen U.S. Courthouse on May 27, 2020, in Chicago. (Erin Hooley / Chicago Tribune)
The Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in downtown Chicago will reopen Wednesday after “system failures” prompted a one-day closure of the 60-year-old building, delaying the high-profile trial of singer R. Kelly.
The courthouse at 219 S. Dearborn St. “experienced building-wide system failures that impacted the ability to open the building,” Thomas Bruton, the clerk of the U.S. District Court, said in an emailed statement. “We apologize for the interruptions and inconvenience that delayed several proceedings and jury trials.”

No further description of the system issues was provided.
The closure delayed proceedings in several ongoing trials at the building, including that of disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly and two former associates on charges related to child pornography and obstruction of justice.

Kelly’s Chicago federal trial was slated to begin its fourth week on Tuesday morning, when defense attorneys were expected to continue presenting their witnesses.
Afternoon Briefing Daily Chicago Tribune editors' top story picks, delivered to your inbox each afternoon. >
The trial has been on a tight schedule. Given continued COVID-19 restrictions, only one courtroom at Dirksen is large enough to handle a multiple-defendant trial, and it is in high demand. If Kelly’s trial lasts much longer than four weeks, it risks conflicting with subsequent trials slated for that courtroom, which could throw off schedules for months to come.
The building closure, coupled with the long holiday weekend, means Kelly’s trial will almost certainly go into a fifth week. Defense attorneys have yet to call several expected witnesses, including co-defendant Derrel McDavid, who was slated to begin testifying on his own behalf Tuesday.
Closing arguments are likely to be lengthy, and jury deliberations are always unpredictable — especially given the relatively complicated charges.
Kelly, 55, faces an indictment charging him with 13 counts of producing and receiving child pornography, enticing minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Also charged are former Kelly associates McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, who are accused in an alleged scheme to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and to hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.

Cantor R. Kelly é declarado culpado de pornografía infantil,"CB Correio Braziliense
(crédito: KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI)
O cantor de R&B R. Kelly, que cumpre pena de 30 anos por crimes sexuais, foi declarado culpado de pornografia infantil nesta quarta-feira, após um mês de julgamento em sua cidade natal, Chicago.
Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55, foi condenado por três acusações de produção de pornografia infantil e outras três por atrair um menor para relações sexuais, informou o ""Chicago Tribune"".
Kelly, três vezes vencedor do Grammy, foi absolvido por um júri federal de outras sete acusações, incluindo a de obstrução da Justiça em um julgamento anterior, destacou o jornal. Ele e dois ex-sócios eram acusados de obstruir um julgamento de pornografia infantil em 2008, no qual um júri o considerou inocente.
O ex-representante de Kelly Derrel McDavid e um antigo funcionário, Milton ""June"" Brown, também foram absolvidos hoje das acusações de obstrução.
O júri, de 12 pessoas, levou cerca de 11 horas para chegar ao veredito, que poderia adicionar uma forte condenação à sentença de 30 anos de prisão que o cantor recebeu em Nova York em setembro por recrutar adolescentes e mulheres para praticar sexo. No caso de Nova York, o cantor de ""I Believe I Can Fly"" foi declarado culpado de oito acusações de tráfico sexual e uma de extorsão.
A condenação de R. Kelly naquela cidade, a primeira em um julgamento no qual a maioria das partes civis eram mulheres negras, foi considerada um ponto de virada no movimento #MeToo. Os debates lançaram luz sobre ""o sistema"" de R. Kelly para atrair jovens e estuprá-las com a cumplicidade de pessoas do seu entorno.
Muitas vítimas contaram que o conheceram em shows e que membros da equipe do artista lhes entregaram pedaços de papel com o contato do cantor, que também é processado em outros dois estados. Várias delas disseram que receberam a promessa de que Kelly poderia fazer decolar sua carreira musical.
O que realmente acontecia era que elas eram ""doutrinadas"" e forçadas a ter relações sexuais, mantidos em um ""sistema sórdido, sob medidas coercitivas"", segundo a acusação.",2022-09-05T03:00:00Z,https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br,Correio Braziliense
"B2K Shares That Nelly Turned Down ""Bump Bump Bump"" Because Of Its Association To R. Kelly","While the members of B2K have been involved in drama of their own, in a recent interview with Drink Champs, they spilled the beans about different artists. During their lengthy sit-down talk with DJ EFN and N.O.R.E, they talked about numerous topics ranging from music to their feud with Omarion. However, one topic that got social media users talking was centered around R. Kelly.

R. Kelly has not been an easy person to talk about in recent years. After all, he's been sentenced to three decades in prison and he still has another case to fight. While these are just recent updates on the singer, controversy surrounding him has dated back to the 90s and 2000s. That is why, according to J-Boog of B2K, a certain artist was hesitant to work with him in the past.
""Nelly gets the record... but his team just felt like 'We're not touching that right now,"" Boog said, referring to their hit song ""Bump Bump Bump"" which was written by R. Kelly. He went on and said that because Nelly was such a hot topic at the time, they did not want to risk his reputation being harmed because of R. Kelly's accusations.
However, that did not affect P. Diddy as he was eager to complete the song. ""Puff kept it gangsta like, 'You know what? I'll have it back to y'all in 24 to 48 hours at the max with all that sh*t done,"" said Boog. Following his statement, N.O.R.E asked everyone to clap for Diddy's efforts.

Initially, social media users respected Nelly for not working with R. Kelly. That was until they realized that the rapper's team doubled back on their word five years later by having the two collab. In 2007, they worked together and dropped ""Tryin To Get A Number.""

R. Kelly's Daughter Buku Abi Lost Record Deals Because of Her Father's Reputation,"Grammy-winning singer R. Kelly is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence for racketeering and sex trafficking. And while the disgraced music star continues to serve time, those he hurt — including his own family — continue to suffer from his actions. His own daughter, herself a singer, has experienced an adverse effect on her own music career, despite being the child of a hit singer.

Buku Abi has been trying to launch a music career for a decade
R. Kelly‘s daughter was born Joann Kelly and performs under the name Buku Abi. Both Abi and her mother, Andrea Kelly, sat down with Majic 107.5 in August 2022 and spoke about their experiences being the daughter and wife of the embattled R&B singer.
Abi said that her relation to the “Ignition” singer has been hurting her career for a decade. “A lot of people don’t know,” she said, “I do music, I do visual arts. I went to school for it.”
Being the daughter of R. Kelly has hurt her career, either because she’s perceived to have gotten it because of her father or because her father’s reputation has tainted her by association. “The experience has been, ‘You’re only getting this because of who your parents are,’ and then, ‘You’re not getting this because of who your parents are,’” she said.
She lost record deals because of her father
Abi revealed that her last name cost her record deal opportunities.
“From 13 up until 24 I’ve been trying to get into the music business,” she admitted. She spoke about how she flew out to Los Angeles and was prepared to sign a record deal, but the deal was taken away at the last second once someone discovered her connection to Kelly. She said it happened “a good amount” of times.

Her father’s reputation almost led her to suicide
Abi opened up about how her father’s name has hurt her in a 2019 interview with the Associated Press. “I think you get to see a different side of it than somebody who sees it from the outside and gets to see the glitz and glam. I got to see the hell part of it,” she said.
She began to find out about her father’s true actions from others in school. “At home it’s normal, you’re living a life with your parents; your dad and mom aren’t going to go into all the bad things that might be going on outside of home, but kids in school don’t necessarily care,” she said. “Fifth and sixth grade is when I started learning the sore part of it, the not so good part. I think that was the hardest part for me because for so long I went with this image of who my dad [was] and what my family [was].”
She confessed that she considered taking her own life, but music became her saving grace. “Ever since then, I’ve been in it and it’s literally saved my life,” she said.

There were plenty of surprises in prosecution’s case against R. Kelly,"R. Kelly is seen in a courtroom sketch during his federal trial on Aug. 19, 2022, at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. (Cheryl Cook)
High-profile federal conspiracy trials like the one unfolding in Chicago against disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly don’t typically have many made-for-TV bombshells.
By the time the curtain raises, evidentiary issues have largely been worked out. Prosecutors have put forth in detail what they expect their witnesses to say. Defense attorneys have raised their pretrial objections and counterpunch according to the judge’s rulings.

But Kelly’s case hasn’t quite gone by that familiar script.
Instead, there have been several surprises during the two weeks that prosecutors put on their case, which featured 25 witnesses and physical evidence including travel records, private investigator contracts and graphic excerpts of three videotapes purportedly showing Kelly sexually abusing his 14-year-old goddaughter.

Among the more eye-opening developments: One of the five victims that prosecutors told jurors they’d hear from did not testify for reasons so far unexplained. Evidence has shown another minor victim may actually have been legally an adult at the time she met Kelly. And several details laid out in a pretrial prosecution filing describing the expected testimony were either changed or missing altogether when the witnesses were put under oath.
But perhaps the biggest surprise came when a key witness tying Kelly and two co-defendants to an alleged conspiracy to buy back sex tapes told the jury last week that the videotape he was given by former Kelly girlfriend Lisa Van Allen appeared to be a threesome between consenting adults, not child pornography.
[ R. Kelly timeline: Chicago upbringing, rapid rise to stardom and years of sexual abuse charges, suits and rumors, conviction ]
To be sure, the possibility of an outright acquittal for Kelly is likely very remote. Prosecutors presented plenty of evidence over the past several weeks that will be extremely difficult for the singer to overcome, particularly when it comes to the witness “Jane,” Kelly’s goddaughter, who testified that she was the girl on the infamous Kelly videotape from the late 1990s.
Not only has the jury heard from Jane, who came forward after two decades of denying any sexual relations with Kelly, but the panel has also been shown 17 snippets of video allegedly depicting Kelly sexually abusing her, with the R&B star directing her to call him “Daddy” and referring to her “14-year-old” genitalia.
Other counts against Kelly that appear strong include allegations that he sexually abused Jane’s best friend, “Pauline,” who testified she had sexual contact with the singer dozens — if not hundreds — of times when she was underage, including numerous threesomes that he videotaped.
Another alleged victim, “Nia,” testified Kelly flew her to Minneapolis in 1996, when she was 15, and sexually abused her in a hotel room, then had inappropriate sexual contact with her again at his recording studio in Chicago that summer.
A missing witness
If Kelly is convicted on just the counts involving Jane, Pauline and Nia, it would be enough to potentially send him to prison for decades.
But when the jury begins its deliberations sometime next week, they’ll be asked to consider one count involving a victim, “Brittany,” who was never called to testify. Instead, jurors will have to rely on under-oath testimony about Brittany from other witnesses in order to decide if prosecutors have met their burden.

Jane testified early in the trial that Kelly engaged her in threesomes with Brittany between five and 10 times. The first time, Jane was about 15 years old, and Brittany was slightly older, Jane testified. The two girls fell out of friendship when Jane learned that Brittany was also seeing Kelly separately, she testified.
Pauline, meanwhile, told the jury that Kelly also had threesomes with her and Brittany when Pauline was 15 or 16, and said Brittany is about a year older than her. Pauline said that when she was 20, she called Kelly’s business posing as Brittany and threatened to go public about some wrongdoing if he didn’t give her money.
“Well, he called it extortion,” Pauline told the jury. “I called it ‘don’t play with me.’ ”

Prosecutors also have had a difficult time getting around conflicting evidence about the age of another accuser, “Tracy,” at the time she said she started having a sexual relationship with Kelly.
Tracy testified that she encountered the singer at an expo at McCormick Place in 1999, when she was 16, a story backed up by her friend, Kelly Adams, who told the jury she was there at the event, the Expo for Today’s Black Woman.
Prosecutors also showed the jury school records confirming Tracy had graduated from Rich East High School in Park Forest when she was 16, which would match up with the time she said she began interning for a record company executive in charge of promoting Kelly’s label.

On cross-examination, however, Kelly’s attorneys showed both Tracy and Adams sworn statements they made as part of lawsuit Tracy filed against Kelly saying that the expo was actually in 2000, when Tracy would have been 17, which is the age of consent under Illinois law.
That evidence was bolstered last week, when Kelly’s legal team called to the stand Merry Green, who was involved in planning the expo in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Green said Kelly made a promotional appearance at the 2000 expo, not the 1999 event. Green brought with her a printed-out photo of Kelly at the event in 2000, wearing a black hat and smiling as he signed an autograph for a female fan.
Conflicting testimony
Kelly, 55, is charged with 13 counts of producing and receiving child pornography, enticing minors to engage in criminal sexual activity and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Also on trial are former Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.
The conspiracy charges have been by far the most difficult for prosecutors to prove up, in part because the alleged scheme stretches back some 20 years, leading to faded memories and statements by witnesses over the years that seem to conflict.

Another problem for prosecutors are the witnesses themselves, a cast of colorful characters that defense attorneys have sought to portray as admitted liars and profiteers.
Van Allen testified that in the late 1990s, she had sexual contact with Kelly and Jane at the behest of the singer, who also filmed and directed their encounters. After she took one of the tapes and sent it to a friend in Kansas City, Kelly offered her $250,000 to get it back, she said.

When her friend, Keith Murrell, took the witness stand, however, he contradicted Van Allen on several important points, including why she sent him the tape, the number of sexual encounters it depicted and whether money was the motivating factor for returning it to Kelly.
Murrell made a surprise disclosure when he acknowledged on cross-examination by McDavid’s attorney that he’d asked Van Allen to send him the tape because he wanted to see it — even though she’d said she told him only to hold onto it for her.
“I was excited to have the tape, for one, because it was Lisa on there and also Robert Kelly,” Murrell testified. He then stunned everyone in the courtroom by testifying on cross-examination that when he watched the tape, it appeared to involve another adult woman, not an underage girl.
“It just looked like a threesome to me,” he said.

And there was only one sexual encounter on the tape, Murrell said — whereas Van Allen has testified there were three separate scenes, two of which involved just Kelly and his young goddaughter.
Off the script
A month before jury selection began, prosecutors filed what is known as a Santiago proffer — an extensive preview of what alleged co-conspirators are expected to say on the witness stand. Usually the document, which is required under the law, tracks closely with what witnesses wind up saying before the jury.
In this case, however, there have been an unusual number of eyebrow-raising discrepancies.
For one, Kelly accuser Tracy was expected to give potentially damning testimony against Brown, a longtime employee of Kelly’s who is charged with one conspiracy count. In the Santiago proffer, prosecutors said Tracy would testify about a time Brown told her Kelly wanted her to get a hotel room and wait for him there. She told Brown she was only 16 and could not reserve a room herself, according to the proffer, so instead she went to pick up the room key at Kelly’s studio.
When she took the witness stand on Monday, however, Tracy did not mention that anecdote at all, seemingly weakening the largely circumstantial case against Brown.
In addition, prosecutors said in their pretrial proffer they would introduce several business records from now-deceased private investigator Jack Palladino, an effort to corroborate witness Charles Freeman’s testimony that he met with Palladino and McDavid in 2001 to coordinate the recovery of incriminating video footage.

Prosecutors never introduced that paperwork during their case – and now, McDavid’s attorneys want to introduce some of Palladino’s other business records in hopes that they’ll paint Freeman as a lying extortionist. U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber, who is overseeing the case, has not yet ruled on whether those records can be shown to the jury.

Some of the most significant differences between the prosecution proffer and the actual testimony relate to Freeman himself. Freeman is central to prosecutors’ allegations of a wide-ranging conspiracy to seek out and cover up potentially incriminating videotapes. His testimony in the second week of trial, while dramatic and memorable, showed that he has given several different accounts of the story, some of which contradict each other.
And some of his testimony at trial differed from what was previewed in the Santiago proffer. For instance, prosecutors asserted that Freeman would say he was offered money to recover two separate videotapes during an initial meeting with Palladino and McDavid: one, from Van Allen for $100,000, and a separate tape in a different location, for $1 million.
On the stand, however, Freeman’s testimony about that meeting gave details about only one agreement for $1 million to recover video footage in Georgia.
“Derrel said it was a performance tape they really needed to recover, and if I would recover the tape they would take care of me, those were his exact words,” Freeman said. “They asked me what would I charge to recover the stolen tapes and I just threw (out) the number — I said a million dollars.”
Prosecutors also previewed testimony about a dramatic sequence of events after Freeman got the tape that differed significantly from Freeman’s actual statements on the stand.

According to prosecutors, Freeman was expected to say that he admitted to making copies of the video but refused to take a lie-detector test, which led to a contentious exchange where McDavid and Palladino called him an extortionist and told him he could get in trouble for possessing child pornography.

Later on, Kelly called Freeman and asked him to smooth things over so Freeman could get paid, according to the proffer. Freeman was expected to say that not long afterward he met with Kelly, McDavid and Brown at Kelly’s studio, where Kelly told him something along the lines of “my life is on the line” because he was being investigated for an interest in teenage girls. Then Freeman agreed to turn over one of the copies he had made of the tape, he was expected to say.
But Freeman never mentioned any of that on the witness stand.
Instead, Freeman’s testimony apparently skipped ahead in time to other matters that had been previewed in the proffer: He ultimately passed a polygraph test, then afterward met with McDavid and Palladino in a hotel suite since they told him they knew he had kept a copy of the tape, he said.
When they showed him two brown bags full of money, he handed over the tape, he testified during trial, saying he took the copy from “between my pants and my buttcheeks … and handed it directly to Jack Palladino.”
“I counted the money getting on the elevator going down. $75,000. All cash,” Freeman said.

R. Kelly Informs Judge He Won't Testify In Child Pornography Case: Report,"R. Kelly's trial continues with new developments emerging every day. So far, we know that the government has presented several alleged victims who claim to have been sexually abused by Kelly as minors that have taken the stand. One woman, who is now 37, said Kelly began abusing her when she was 14 and he was 30 years old.

It does not look like Kelly will be taking the stand during his trial. According to NBC Chicago, Judge Harry Leinenweber asked Kelly if he discussed taking the stand with his lawyer. Kelly told the judge that he and his lawyers had that discussion, though he declined to testify.
Judge Leinenweber brought up the subject just before attorneys for Kelly and his two co-defendants, Derrel McDavid, Kelly's business manager, and Milton Brown, brought out their witnesses. McDavid agreed to testify while Brown took the same stance as Kelly.
Kelly faces accusations of child pornography, tampering with the 2008 trial, and luring minors for sex. McDavid is charged with helping Kelly fix the 2008 while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography.
McDavid's witness is a former police officer who testified that McDavid informed him in 2001 that someone was trying to blackmail Kelly.
Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June for racketeering and sex trafficking charges. We'll keep you posted on updates regarding the case.

What R. Kelly’s Accusers Said in His Chicago Trial,"Photo: Cheryl Cook/AP/Shutterstock
On August 15, R. Kelly’s second federal trial in less than a year started in a Chicago courtroom. The 55-year-old, who was convicted of racketeering and sex crimes in Brooklyn federal court last September, faces charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice. Federal prosecutors claim that Kelly engaged in sexual activities with five survivors when they were minors and that he recorded these encounters on video. These alleged incidents occurred during the late 1990s and early 2000s. (A note about how we’re using alleged and allegedly in covering this trial: Kelly was found guilty in his New York case of one set of crimes, but as his Chicago trial is ongoing, prosecutors’ statements all remain allegations.)
Two of Kelly’s purported co-conspirators, Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, are on trial with him. Prosecutors claim that McDavid and Brown schemed to cover up Kelly’s alleged crimes and assisted him in derailing his 2008 child-pornography trial in Chicago, which concluded with a verdict of “not guilty.” According to the prosecution, some of the alleged attempted cover-ups included the coordination of payouts to accusers as well as to a would-be whistleblower. The prosecution rested its case-in-chief on August 30, and the defense started presenting its case on September 1. McDavid and Brown maintain their innocence. Kelly insists that he’s innocent as well despite his previous conviction. (Kelly was sentenced in New York on June 29 to 30 years in prison.) Here’s what has happened in Kelly’s Chicago trial so far.
Kelly’s former goddaughter testified about alleged abuse.
A woman identified in court as “Jane” testified on August 18 that Kelly had sexually abused her “hundreds” of times when she was a minor. She said that she was the person in a videotape with Kelly that was the subject of his 2008 child-pornography trial in Chicago. Jane said she was 14 when the video was made — which means that Kelly would have been about 30 years old, according to the Associated Press. Jane had refused to testify during Kelly’s 2008 trial, which is what several jurors in that case said made them acquit him. Jane, now 37, said that she’d lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she claimed that it wasn’t her in the video. “I was afraid something bad would happen to Robert,” Jane reportedly testified. “I was protecting him.” Jane said she’d lied because “I also did not want that person to be me” and “I was ashamed.” When asked why she started to discuss what allegedly happened with Kelly in recent years, Jane reportedly said, “I became exhausted living with his lies.” She told jurors that federal prosecutors said they would not charge her with lying to authorities in the previous case if she testified honestly at this trial, according to the report.
Jurors saw these alleged graphic videos.
On August 19, jurors watched graphic excerpts from three recordings which purportedly showed Kelly sexually abusing Jane, per the Chicago Tribune. The gallery could not see the excerpts but could hear a lot of the audio. Jane’s voice — described by the Tribune as “high and very young-sounding” — referenced her “14-year-old” genitals multiple times. In another clip, Jane used the phrase again, as did the man she had identified as Kelly. Jane was instructed, “Get on your knees,” in one excerpt. “Daddy, do you still love me?” Jane answered. The man Jane alleged was Kelly gave her instructions at various points and at one point remarked, “I said don’t move,” according to the Tribune report.
Three other accusers testified under pseudonyms: “Pauline,” “Tracy,” and “Nia.”
One woman, identified in court as “Pauline,” testified that Jane had introduced her to the singer when she and Jane were both 14. Pauline, now 37, claimed that she once saw Jane naked with Kelly and that he’d encouraged the girls to touch each other sexually, reports said. When she was 15 or 16, Pauline allegedly started having sexual intercourse with Kelly, which would have been illegal given her age, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. A woman identified in court as “Tracy” said she’d met Kelly when she was 16. Tracy, then an intern at Epic Records, testified that they started having sexual encounters not long after they’d met. A woman referred to as “Nia” said that she’d met Kelly at an Atlanta mall in 1996, when she was 15. Nia testified that she’d asked Kelly for his autograph and left their meeting with his phone number. They started speaking on the phone. Nia did wind up telling Kelly her age, the Sun-Times reported of her testimony. She claimed that Kelly arranged for her to attend one of his shows in Minneapolis. The morning following his concert, Nia alleged, Kelly went to the hotel room where she was staying. Kelly allegedly touched her breasts and started to touch himself. Afterward, Kelly “left in a rush,” Nia reportedly testified. Nia stayed with family in Chicago that summer and visited Kelly’s recording studio with her cousins. When she first visited his studio, Nia testified that she went into the hall to see him. Kelly kissed and groped her, Nia reportedly said. A fifth accuser who was expected to testify, “Brittany,” did not. The prosecution did not reveal why she was not called, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Witnesses detailed an alleged cover-up and witness intimidation.
Several witnesses claimed that Kelly and his associates worked hard to keep witnesses from coming forward, multiple reports said. Jane’s mother, identified in court as “Susan,” told jurors her family was afraid of Kelly. When Susan and her husband confronted Kelly in the early 2000s to ask whether he was abusing Jane, he allegedly said, “You are with us or against us,” USA Today reported. “We were very, very frightened,” Susan reportedly testified. Susan admitted that she and her family had lied in advance of Kelly’s 2008 trial, claiming at the time that Jane wasn’t the female in the tape. Kelly and his confidants told the family to lie to the grand jury. They agreed, because “we feared for our lives,” the newspaper quoted her as saying.
Lisa Van Allen, one of Kelly’s ex-girlfriends, said that she was threatened for taking sex tapes from the singer. Van Allen, who also took the stand against Kelly in his 2008 trial, said she took the videos when Kelly left his things unattended, according to USA Today. One of these recordings was of her, Kelly, and Jane participating in sexual activity. Van Allen claimed she didn’t know that Jane was 14. Van Allen alleged that, in 2007, McDavid told her that a polygraph indicated she was lying about returning these videos. “He said that I failed [the lie-detector] and that they should have murked me from the beginning,” Van Allen reportedly testified.
Charles Freeman, a former merchandising agent for Kelly, said that Kelly had offered him $1 million to retrieve the tape that allegedly showed him abusing Jane, USA Today reported. Freeman said he’d found the tape in a Chicago residence. Kelly and his circle took years to pay him the promised fee in its entirety. Freeman claimed to have seen the tape and that it was of “Robert Kelly with a young lady having sex.” Freeman said he didn’t give police the recording for almost 20 years, “because the police wasn’t going to pay me a million dollars,” the newspaper reported.
The defense started its case.
Defense attorneys in the case started calling their witnesses on September 1. One of the defense witnesses included Christopher Wilson, a former Chicago Police Department detective who said he was a longtime friend of McDavid. According to CBS News, Wilson said in 2001 McDavid “informed me that Mr. Kelly was being blackmailed.” Wilson testified that McDavid wanted him to go with a private investigator to interview the suspected extortionist. While Wilson didn’t identify the blackmailer, the chronology and prior trial testimony suggested that he was referring to Freeman. Wilson said he wasn’t around when the private detective questioned this suspect. He also claimed that nobody indicated that the potential blackmail situation involved child pornography, per CBS. Wilson’s testimony about alleged blackmail reflects a key element of Kelly’s defense. During openings, Kelly’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, told the jury to consider whether he was a victim “of financial exploitation, extortion.” Bonjean reportedly said: “There are strong motivators out there” and “The government’s case really does hinge on the testimony of liars, extortionists, people who engaged in the business of trafficking pornography.” While McDavid claimed he would testify in his own defense, Kelly and Brown said they would not. It’s not surprising that Kelly and Brown won’t testify, given it is uncommon for criminal defendants to take the stand.",2022-09-02T16:25:14Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
La défense se met en place et le chanteur R. Kelly ne témoignera pas à son procès,"Les avocats de R. Kelly ont commencé à forger une défense jeudi à Chicago, avec un premier témoin affirmant que le chanteur était lui-même victime de chantage.
R. Kelly ne se présentera pas à la barre des témoins, lui qui est accusé d’avoir incité des filles mineures à avoir des relations sexuelles, d’avoir produit de la pornographie juvénile et d’avoir réussi à truquer son procès en 2008. Le juge Harry Leinenweber a demandé directement à R. Kelly jeudi matin s’il voulait témoigner, et la vedette déchue du R&B a répondu qu’il ne le ferait pas. Le juge a soulevé la question quelques minutes avant que les avocats de R. Kelly et de deux co-accusés ne commencent à appeler leurs premiers témoins, s’efforçant de contrer deux semaines de témoignages de la poursuite _ y compris de quatre femmes qui ont accusé le chanteur d’abus sexuels.
Le co-accusé Derrel McDavid, un directeur commercial de longue date de R. Kelly, est accusé d’avoir aidé le chanteur à truquer le procès de 2008, au cours duquel R. Kelly a été acquitté. M. McDavid a dit qu’il témoignerait. Le co-accusé Milton Brown est accusé d’avoir obtenu de la pornographie juvénile. Comme R. Kelly, il a dit qu’il ne témoignerait pas. Témoigner aurait été risqué. Parfois, R. Kelly a explosé de colère face à des questions difficiles, ce qui pourrait nuire à sa défense. L’équipe juridique de M. McDavid a appelé le premier témoin de la défense, l’ami de M. McDavid et ancien policier Christopher G. Wilson. Il a témoigné que M. McDavid lui avait dit en 2001 qu’un agent de marchandisage de R. Kelly, Charles Freeman, tentait de faire chanter la vedette de R&B.
M. Freeman a témoigné plus tôt pour le gouvernement que R. Kelly et ses associés avaient accepté de lui payer 1 million $ US pour récupérer une vidéo mettant en vedette R. Kelly, décrivant comment on lui avait remis des sacs pleins d’argent en guise de paiement. Il a dit que l’argent était pour des services rendus, pas une offre d’extorsion. Les procureurs affirment que les paiements faisaient partie d’un complot visant à entraver le travail des enquêteurs dans le cadre du procès de R. Kelly en 2008. En contre-interrogatoire, M. Wilson a admis qu’il n’avait pas été témoin directement de quiconque essayant d’extorquer des fonds à R. Kelly, affirmant qu’il s’appuyait sur ce que M. McDavid lui avait dit.
Une condamnation pour seulement une ou deux des accusations lors du procès de Chicago pourrait ajouter des années à une peine de 30 ans que R. Kelly s’est déjà fait imposer par un juge fédéral de New York en juin pour des condamnations pour extorsion et trafic sexuel. Par l’intermédiaire de témoins jeudi, la défense a également cherché à soulever des doutes sur l’âge de quelques accusatrices, affirmant qu’au moins l’une d’entre elles avait peut-être 17 ans, l’âge du consentement dans l’Illinois, au moment où R. Kelly aurait eu des relations sexuelles avec elle.
Il n’y avait rien de nécessairement sinistre à propos de R. Kelly ou de ses employés échangeant des liquidités en quantité importante, a déclaré aux jurés un autre témoin de la défense, l’ancien stagiaire au studio de R. Kelly, Tom Arnold. R. Kelly utilisait rarement ses propres cartes de crédit et préférait les transactions en espèces, a ajouté M. Arnold, qui a déclaré avoir apporté une fois 125 000 $ à R. Kelly dans un sac à dos. Le point culminant de la présentation des procureurs a été le témoignage il y a deux semaines d’une femme de 37 ans qui a utilisé le pseudonyme « Jane ». Elle a affirmé que R. Kelly l’avait agressée sexuellement des centaines de fois à partir de 1998, alors qu’elle avait 14 ans et R. Kelly avait environ 30 ans.
Les plaidoiries finales devraient avoir lieu au milieu de la semaine prochaine.

Los Angeles House by Playboy Mansion Architect Lists for Nearly $7.8 Million,"Text size
What do the Playboy Mansion and this newly listed $7.795 million home have in common? They were both built by the notable architect Arthur R. Kelly.
Prolific in the Los Angeles area, Kelly designed some 500 homes and buildings over his career, which saw most of his work owned by Hollywood’s elite across the city’s affluent Holmby Hills neighborhood and Beverly Hills.

He built this single-family home in L.A.’s Hancock Park neighborhood in 1920, seven years before he’d go on to design the infamous mansion that would end up being the headquarters of Hugh Hefner’s Playboy empire, according to the listing with Jackie Smith of Compass, who bought the home to the market last week.
“Impeccable room scale and timeless elegance are standout features of the work of [Kelly] and these qualities are fully realized in [the home],” Ms. Smith told Mansion Global over email, noting that the architect also designed all of the buildings for the Westlake School for Girls (now known as Harvard-Westlake School) in Bel-Air and the nearby Wilshire Country Club, which is minutes away from the property.
“These are notable details for buyers interested in architecture and homes that are traditional style, which was one of his specialities,” Ms. Smith added.
Spanning close to 6,000 square feet, the six-bedroom home has had a multi-million dollar renovation in the past few years by the current owner, according to Compass. The owner, listed as a limited liability company, purchased the property in 2016 for $3.48 million, records with PropertyShark show.
Upgrades were made across the property, including to the home’s multiple kitchens, primary bedroom suite, bathrooms and fully finished basement, which was designed for a future wine cellar or storage room.
The house also boasts light-filled interiors, hardwood floors, an “opulent” living room with a fireplace, a family room, a formal dining room and a “park-like” backyard. Plus there’s an accessory dwelling unit that can be used as an office or guest house, according to the listing.
The Playboy Mansion, some eight miles west in Holmby Hills, was purchased by Playboy Enterprises in 1971 for $1.05 million, Mansion Global previously reported. The mansion served as Hefner’s longtime home and playground, until his death at the age of 91 in 2017.
The mansion had sold the year prior, in August 2016 for a whopping $100 million, to Hefner’s neighbor, Daren Metropoulos a principal at private-equity firm Metropoulos & Co. As a condition of the sale, Hefner was allowed to live in the home until his death, Mansion Global previously reported.

R. Kelly's lawyers start defense; he says he won't testify,"Judge Harry Leinenweber asked Kelly directly on Thursday morning if he would testify, and the Grammy Award winner responded that he would not.
R. Kelly’s lawyers began mounting a defense Thursday in Chicago against federal charges of child pornography, enticement of minors for sex and fixing his 2008 state trial, with an initial witness contending the singer was himself a victim of blackmail. The presentation to jurors won’t include Kelly taking the witness stand.
Judge Harry Leinenweber asked Kelly directly on Thursday morning if he would testify, and the Grammy Award winner responded that he would not. The judge raised the issue minutes before attorneys for Kelly and two co-defendants began calling their first witnesses, endeavouring to counter two weeks of government testimony — including from four women who accused Kelly of sexual abuse.
Co-defendant Derrel McDavid, a longtime Kelly business manager, is accused of helping Kelly rig the 2008 trial, at which Kelly was acquitted. McDavid said he will testify. Co-defendant Milton Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, he said he wouldn’t testify.
Testifying would have been risky. At times, Kelly has exploded in anger under tough questioning, which could hurt his defense. He lost his cool in a 2019 interview with Gayle King on “CBS This Morning.” As she pressed him about accusations of sexual abuse, he jumped up, crying and gesticulating. “I didn’t do this stuff!” he shouted. “This is not me! I’m fighting for my … life!”
Lawyers for all three defendants are essentially sharing witnesses. McDavid’s legal team called the first defense witness, McDavid’s friend and former police officer Christopher G. Wilson. He testified that McDavid told him in 2001 that a merchandizing agent for Kelly, Charles Freeman, was trying to blackmail the R&B star.
Freeman testified earlier for the government that Kelly and his associates agreed to pay him $1 million to hunt down and return a video that featured Kelly, describing how he was handed bags full of cash as payment. He said the money was for services rendered, not an extortion bid. Prosecutors say the payments were part of a conspiracy to obstruct investigators leading up to Kelly’s 2008 trial.
Under cross-examination, Wilson conceded he didn’t directly witness anyone trying to extort Kelly, saying he was relying on what McDavid told him.
A conviction on just one or two of the charges at the Chicago trial could add years to a 30-year sentence Kelly already received from a New York federal judge in June for convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges.
Via witnesses Thursday, the defense also sought to raise doubts about the ages of a few accusers, saying at least one may have been 17, the age of consent in Illinois, at the time Kelly pursued her for sex.
There was nothing necessarily sinister about Kelly or his workers dealing in cash, another defense witness, former Kelly studio intern Tom Arnold, told jurors. Kelly rarely used his own credit cards and preferred cash transactions, added Arnold, who said he once carried $125,000 to Kelly in a backpack.
The highlight of the prosecutors’ presentation was the testimony two weeks ago of a 37-year-old woman who used the pseudonym “Jane.” She described Kelly sexually abusing her hundreds of times starting in 1998 when she was 14 and Kelly was around 30.
Closing arguments are expected to happen in the middle of next week.

Attorneys for R. Kelly and his co-defendants will have the chance to present witnesses Thursday morning after federal prosecutors rested their case-in-chief against the disgraced singer earlier this week.
But first, U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber is expected to announce his rulings on the defendants’ requests to acquit them of all charges before the jury even gets the case.

The motions for judgment of acquittal, filed at the conclusion of the prosecution’s case on Tuesday, are routine in criminal trials and almost always denied. At the very least, they are meant to preserve issues for a possible appeal down the road.
However U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber said before the motions were argued Wednesday that he would not rule immediately, as there were several issues that in his view “deserve consideration.”

Once the motions are decided, all eyes will turn to the defendants: Kelly and his former associates Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown. Their attorneys are scheduled to begin presenting their cases Thursday.
Kelly, 55, is charged with 13 counts of production of child pornography, conspiracy to produce child pornography and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
McDavid and Brown are charged in an alleged scheme to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.

Defense attorneys have so far hinted at an eclectic hodgepodge of potential witnesses, including disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti, former Chicago Sun-Times music critic Jim DeRogatis, and the former lead prosecutor on the case, Angel Krull, who exchanged emails with the star witness that defense attorneys suggested were inappropriate.
Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, who is representing Kelly, told the judge Wednesday that she intends to call record company executive Cathy Carroll, who, according to testimony, introduced one of the Kelly’s alleged minor victims to the singer when the teen interned for her in the late 1990s. Bonjean’s cross-examination on the topic disputed that timeline vigorously, asserting that Kelly actually met the accuser after she had reached the legal age of consent.
McDavid attorney Beau Brindley told reporters this week his team plans to call several witnesses, including a former bodyguard for private investigator Jack Palladino. Brindley claimed the witness will say McDavid was not present for a meeting between Palladino and prosecution witness Chuck Freeman about recovering an alleged videotape of Kelly having sex with a minor.
McDavid himself is expected to take the stand in his own defense, which likely will happen Tuesday. That testimony will be “substantial,” Brindley told reporters.
McDavid’s attorneys also want to show jurors a set of documents from the now-deceased Palladino, who dealt with prosecution witness Charles Freeman regarding the recovery of certain video footage.

While Freeman testified that he sought out the videos at Kelly’s behest, McDavid’s defense is aiming to paint Freeman as a greedy extortionist.
The memos they are seeking to admit describe McDavid’s “perennial requests for more money” and note that -- since Freeman failed a polygraph -- a payment was not for the return of a tape but instead “a quid pro quo for information concerning various disloyal members of R. Kelly’s ‘posse.’”
In one memorable passage, Palladino describes Freeman as “a sleazy bottom-feeder who whines endlessly apparently out of the belief that being extremely annoying is a winning negotiating strategy.”

Kelly’s attorneys, meanwhile, have not said whether the singer will testify, but it would seem to be extremely unlikely given the nature of the charges and the exposure to cross-examination.
“We are still mulling that over,” Bonjean told reporters Wednesday in the lobby of the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse.
Bonjean added that her client is grateful for the support he’s received from fans and that he’s had the opportunity to challenge the witnesses against him in a court of law, rather than having them tell their stories in a one-sided documentary.”

“It’s hard to listen to people tell falsehoods, and because you are perceived as this monster, you have lost your voice to say, “No, that’s a lie,” she said.
Prosecutors rested their case-in-chief Tuesday after calling some 25 witnesses over 10 days of testimony, including four women who said that Kelly had sexually abused them when they were underage. A fifth alleged minor victim mentioned in the indictment, was not called to testify for reasons that so far have not been explained.

"Fizz, Raz-B, & J-Boog Explain How R. Kelly Helped Shape Their Career","Regardless of the crimes that R. Kelly has been convicted of, his devoted fanbase will never stop listening to his music. The ""#MuteRKelly"" movement is still alive and well, albeit not as prevalent these days as they were during the Surviving R. Kelly time in television history. The disgraced music icon has topped the charts, toured the world, earned dozens of awards, and was one of the most respected musicians of his generation—but all of the acclaim came with scandal.
Kelly managed to dodge prison time decades ago when he was accused of having sex with underage girls, but in recent years, new allegations have surfaced, resulting in a conviction.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by Drink Champs (@drinkchamps)
As his current trial moves forward, Kelly's influence was discussed on a this week's episode of Drink Champswith B2K—or, should we say, B2K minus Omarion.
Raz-B, Fizz, and J-Boog caught up with the series and talked all things related to their career and the fallout with their missing member. During the conversation, the trio proudly mentioned Kelly's reach in their development, with J-Boog saying, ""He did every single on our second album. Clean flush, bro. And the remixes.""
Fizz slid in with, ""And took all the publishing."" The comment made everyone laugh, but in the end, the singers didn't mind missing out on publishing money because of just how much work Kelly put into their songs.

The federal judge R. Kelly’s federal child pornography trial is scheduled to take up requests by the disgraced R&B star and his two co-defendants to acquit them of all charges before the jury even gets the case.
The motions for judgment of acquittal, filed at the conclusion of the prosecution’s case on Tuesday, are routine in criminal trials and almost always denied. At the very least, they are meant to preserve issues for a possible appeal down the road.

After U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber rules on the motions, all eyes will turn to the defendants, who are scheduled to begin presenting their cases on Thursday.
The jury has so far heard mention of a eclectic hodgepodge of potential defense witnesses, including disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti, former Chicago Sun-Times music critic Jim DeRogatis, and the former lead prosecutor on the case, Angel Krull, who exchanged emails with the star witness that defense attorneys suggested were inappropriate.

Lawyers for Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, promised in their opening statement to jurors that he will take the stand in his own defense.
Kelly’s attorney’s, meanwhile, have been silent on whether the singer will testify, but it would seem to be extremely unlikely given the nature of the charges and the exposure to cross-examination.
In her motion for acquittal filed Tuesday night, Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, wrote that the government failed to present sufficient evidence showing the singer “knowingly” coerced his goddaughter into sexually illicit conduct “for the purpose of” producing child pornography.
Bonjean also argued there was no evidence that the graphic videotapes made by Kelly of him allegedly sexually assaulting the girl, who was 14 at the time, “ever left the state of Illinois,” which is one of the elements prosecutors must prove to sustain a conviction on the child pornography counts.
“In fact, it is undisputed that the tapes are copies made by someone, but the government could not establish where the tapes were copied or by whom,” Bonjean wrote. “The government simply did not prove that the tapes were transported in interstate or foreign commerce.”
Regarding other counts of conspiracy and receipt of child pornography, Bonjean said the evidence was lacking. She also brought up a crucial theory of the defense — that the effort by Kelly and his business manager, Derrel McDavid, to buy back a sex tape had nothing to do with underage girls, but instead involved Kelly’s then-wife and another adult woman.
“The government’s evidence, even in its best light, failed to show (Kelly) specifically sought to receive child pornography, rather than any embarrassing sex tapes – such as a threesome video involving his ex-wife,” the motion stated.
McDavid’s attorneys, Beau Brindley and Vadim Glozman, argued that the government’s case had multiple “fatal flaws,” including statute of limitation issues and witnesses who were unreliable and had changed their stories multiple times over the years.

The trial’s first week focused on “Jane,” who identified herself as the girl being sexually abused by the then-superstar in three separate videos from the 1990s.
One of those videos became the subject of Kelly’s 2008 Cook County trial, during which he was acquitted of child pornography charges because, prosecutors now allege, Kelly and his associates went to great lengths to keep “Jane” quiet and recover other incriminating footage.
Witnesses last week largely focused on those efforts. Three people testified that Kelly’s team paid them to bring him videos of his homemade child pornography while he was awaiting his Cook County trial. Defense attorneys, during lengthy cross-examinations, have challenged their stories as inconsistent and tried to paint them as unreliable extortionists.

Jurors on Monday heard from two other women who testified about their sexual contact with Kelly while they were underage. Pauline said she had sexual contact with the disgraced singer dozens if not hundreds of times when she was underage, and Tracy — who testified using only her first name — told jurors in extensive detail about Kelly’s sexual abuse and assault of her when she was 16.

"Prosecutors rest in R. Kelly's trial-fixing, child porn case","Michael Tarm, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday at R. Kelly's federal trial in Chicago after presenting two weeks of evidence and testimony from four Kelly accusers in their bid to prove the singer enticed underage girls for sex, produced child pornography and successfully rigged his 2008 state trial.
Among the last prosecution witnesses was a 42-year-old woman who went by the pseudonym “Nia.” Taking the stand Tuesday morning, she was the fourth and final accuser to testify against Kelly at the trial in his hometown. A fifth accuser, who prosecutors had said would testify, never did. They didn't explain why.
The highlight of prosecutors' case was testimony by a 37-year-old woman who used the pseudonym “Jane” and described Kelly sexually abusing her hundreds of times starting in 1998 when she was 14 and Kelly was around 30.
Jane's testimony is vital to the charge accusing Kelly of fixing his 2008 child pornography trial, at which he was acquitted. She testified that Kelly and his associates threatened and paid off her and her parents to lie to a grand jury before the 2008 trial.
Legal teams for Kelly and two co-defendants now get their chance to attack the government's case. U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber told jurors they would have Wednesday off, then return to listen to the first defense witnesses Thursday. Closing arguments are in the middle of next week.
Defense attorneys haven't said if Kelly might testify. He didn't testify at his earlier federal trial in New York, where a judge sentenced him in June to 30 years in prison for convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. A conviction in Chicago could add years to that sentence.

R. Kelly Trial: Prosecutors Rest,"Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday (Aug. 30) at R. Kelly’s federal trial in Chicago after presenting two weeks of testimony, including from four Kelly accusers, in their bid to prove the singer enticed underage girls for sex, produced child pornography and successfully rigged his 2008 state trial.

Among the last prosecution witnesses was a 42-year-old woman who went by the pseudonym “Nia.” Taking the stand Tuesday morning, she was the fourth and final accuser to testify at the trial in Kelly’s hometown. A fifth accuser, who prosecutors had said during openings would testify, never did. They didn’t explain why.
Through her testimony, Nia painted a picture of Kelly as a master manipulator who reeled in star-stuck fans, like her, to sexually abuse them and then discarded them.
The highlight of prosecutors’ case came two weeks ago with the testimony of a 37-year-old woman who used the pseudonym “Jane.” She described Kelly sexually abusing her hundreds of times starting in 1998 when she was 14 and Kelly was around 30.
Jane’s testimony is vital to the charge accusing Kelly of fixing his 2008 child pornography trial, at which he was acquitted. She testified that Kelly and his associates threatened and paid off her and her parents to lie to a grand jury before that trial.
Legal teams for Kelly and two co-defendants now get their chance to attack the government’s case. Judge Harry Leinenweber told jurors they would have Wednesday off, then return for the first defense witnesses Thursday. Closing arguments are expected to happen in the middle of next week.
A New York federal judge sentenced Kelly in June to 30 years in prison for convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges.
Kelly gave Nia, an aspiring actress and model, his telephone number after the then-15 year-old asked him for an autograph at an Atlanta mall in 1996, she testified. She said Kelly knew her age when he invited her to a concert in Minnesota, bought her plane ticket and sent a limousine with an all-red interior to pick her up.
On the way to the airport, Nia stopped to buy a red rose for Kelly, which she placed in her hotel room. When Kelly came to her room, he kissed her, then told her to undress and sit next to him on the bed. She said she was uncomfortable but did as he said. After touching her and himself, he quickly left, she said.
“I never got the chance to give him the rose,” Nia told jurors.
Nia spoke calmly and clearly as Kelly, wearing in a dark blue suit and black face mask, sat some 25 feet (7.6 meters) in front of her and looked directly at her. When Jane testified earlier in the trial, he often kept his eyes down.
Nia said that for weeks after meeting Kelly, he promptly answered all her calls. But before long, he never answered them. When she saw him years later at a video shoot, she said she was hurt when he didn’t appear to recognize or acknowledge her.
She ended up suing Kelly in the early 2000s, alleging sexual abuse. Kelly quickly settled, paying her $500,000.
Kelly’s 2008 state trial revolved around a video prosecutors said showed him sexually abusing Jane. She did not testify at that trial, but she told jurors at the current trial that she was the child in the video and Kelly was the adult man. Jurors at the ongoing trial viewed excerpts of that video and two others.
Kelly sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse began circulating publicly in the 1990s. Widespread outrage didn’t emerge until after the #MeToo reckoning and the 2019 docuseries Surviving R. Kelly.

Federal prosecutors called Kelly Adams to the stand late Monday to corroborate the claims of her friend Tracy, who testified Monday using only her first name.

Tracy told jurors in extensive detail about Kelly’s sexual abuse and assault of her when she was 16. Another Kelly accuser also testified Monday under the pseudonym “Pauline,” saying she had sexual contact with the disgraced singer dozens if not hundreds of times when she was underage.
Both women came under intense cross-examination from Kelly’s lead defense attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, who asserted that both women had actually reached 17 — Illinois’ age of consent — when they began their sexual relationships with Kelly.

2 more R. Kelly accusers testify at trial in Chicago,"CHICAGO (AP) - Two more accusers took the witness stand at R. Kelly’s child pornography and solicitation of minors trial Monday, bringing to three the total number of accusers to have testified to date at the federal trial in Chicago.
The first accuser, who testified two weeks ago under the pseudonym “Jane,” is critical to another of the charges — that the R&B singer successfully rigged his 2008 state child pornography trial by threating witnesses and concealing video evidence.
GRAPHIC WARNING: This story contains details that may be disturbing to some.
Kelly, 55, was handed a 30-year prison sentence by a federal judge in New York in June for convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges.
In all, the prosecution cited five accusers in pre-trial filings, though it is unclear if both of the remaining accusers will testify before the government rests sometime this week. The trial was expected to last a month, wrapping up in mid-September.
An accuser who used the pseudonym “Pauline,” told jurors Monday she was a middle school classmate of Jane’s and that Jane introduced her to Kelly in 1998 when they were 14 and Kelly was around 30.
When she was at Kelly’s Chicago home later that year, Pauline said she was startled to walk in on Kelly and a naked Jane in a basement area. She said Kelly told her that “we all have secrets” and that this is “our secret.”
Pauline several times told jurors she had loved Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now had a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids, I’m killing ‘em. Period,” she said.
Kelly sexually abused her over 100 times, starting when she was 14, and they first had intercourse when she was 15, she testified.
Under cross-examination, lead Kelly lawyer Jennifer Bonjean accused Pauline of being imprecise about how many times she had sex with Kelly when she was underage.
“Whether it is once or twice, what’s wrong is wrong,” Pauline shot back.
The second accuser to testify Monday, referred to only as Tracy, said she was introduced to Kelly when she was 16 by a boss at a record company she was interning for in 1998. Tracy told jurors she repeatedly rebuffed Kelly’s advances.
At a room in Kelly’s Chicago studio, she recalled telling him after he began pulling her close to him, “You know I’m 16?” Minutes later, when he “exposed himself… I tried to pull back but he had a hold of my shirt,” Tracy testified.
On another occasion, she described Kelly coming into a hotel room where Tracy was staying and yelling at her for having clothes on under her bathrobe.
“I told him I didn’t want to have sex,” she testified.
But she said Kelly ordered her to get into the bed with him anyway and that at several points used force to sexually abuse her. She said she first had intercourse with Kelly when she was 16, then dozens of times when she was 17 and 18.

2 more R. Kelly accusers testify at trial in Chicago,"Michael Tarm, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - Two more accusers took the witness stand at R. Kelly's child pornography and solicitation of minors trial Monday, bringing to three the total number of accusers to have testified to date at the federal trial in Chicago.
The first accuser, who testified two weeks ago under the pseudonym “Jane,” is critical to another of the charges - that the R&B singer successfully rigged his 2008 state child pornography trial by threating witnesses and concealing video evidence.
Kelly, 55, was handed a 30-year prison sentence by a federal judge in New York in June for convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges.
In all, the prosecution cited five accusers in pre-trial filings, though it is unclear if both of the remaining accusers will testify before the government rests sometime this week. The trial was expected to last a month, wrapping up in mid-September.
An accuser who used the pseudonym “Pauline,” told jurors Monday she was a middle school classmate of Jane's and that Jane introduced her to Kelly in 1998 when they were 14 and Kelly was around 30.
When she was at Kelly's Chicago home later that year, Pauline said she was startled to walk in on Kelly and a naked Jane in a basement area. She said Kelly told her that “we all have secrets” and that this is “our secret.”
Pauline several times told jurors she had loved Kelly. But, as a 37-year-old mom, she said she now had a different perspective.
“If somebody did something to my kids, I'm killing 'em. Period,” she said.
Kelly sexually abused her over 100 times, starting when she was 14, and they first had intercourse when she was 15, she testified.
Under cross-examination, lead Kelly lawyer Jennifer Bonjean accused Pauline of being imprecise about how many times she had sex with Kelly when she was underage.
“Whether it is once or twice, what's wrong is wrong,” Pauline shot back.
The second accuser to testify Monday, referred to only as Tracy, said she was introduced to Kelly when she was 16 by a boss at a record company she was interning for in 1998. Tracy told jurors she repeatedly rebuffed Kelly's advances.
At a room in Kelly's Chicago studio, she recalled telling him after he began pulling her close to him, “You know I'm 16?” Minutes later, when he “exposed himselfâ€¦ I tried to pull back but he had a hold of my shirt,” Tracy testified.
On another occasion, she described Kelly coming into a hotel room where Tracy was staying and yelling at her for having clothes on under her bathrobe.
“I told him I didn't want to have sex,” she testified.
But she said Kelly ordered her to get into the bed with him anyway and that at several points used force to sexually abuse her. She said she first had intercourse with Kelly when she was 16, then dozens of times when she was 17 and 18.
Tracy began to cry on the stand Monday as she began to tell jurors about the day Kelly walked into a room where Tracy had been waiting. Kelly arrived with Jane.

Two R. Kelly Survivors Testify He Allegedly Videotaped Them Having Sex As Minors,"R. Kelly's name has been littered through the headlines in recent weeks as the embattled singer's Chicago federal trial continues. The most recent update from the courtroom was shared in the Chicago Tribune and details testimony from two accusers, who claim that the R&B star videotaped them having sex as minors.
The first witness earlier today (August 29), was a 37-year-old testifying under ""Pauline"" as a pseudonym. Pauline was reportedly best friends with Kelly's goddaughter, ""Jane,"" and around age 14, she went looking for her friend at the singer's home, where she found Jane ""naked, kneeling in front of Kelly.""

""He told me he was just looking for bruises on her, because she hurt herself,"" Pauline recalled. ""I told him that ‘That’s not how you look for bruises’ and he said that’s how he looked for bruises... then he stated that 'We all have secrets.'""
R. Kelly was in the room for the testimony, dressed in a dark blue suit. Reports say he ""kept his head down, sometimes shaking it back and forth as she’s talked about things he allegedly said to her about 'secrets.'""
According to Pauline, the 55-year-old insisted she engage in sexual activity with him and Jane. Eventually hooking up became a regular occurrence for the three of them – ""dozens or maybe hundreds of times"" from age 14 to 16 – after Kelly provided them with alcohol.
""He had tripods and cameras in the room,"" Pauline shared when explaining Kelly's interest in taping his sexual interactions, adding that he stored them in a gym bag, and would record his threesomes with Pauline and another girl, ""Brittany.""
Though things were troubling, Pauline remained in a relationship with Kelly into her adulthood. At age 20, she posed as Brittany and made a call to the father of three's studio in search of money.
""Well, he called it extortion, I called it 'Don’t play with me,'"" Pauline told the jury. ""Girls get mad and say stupid stuff and want to slap you or bust your car windows out. It was just a threat. He knew that. If he didn’t know that he wouldn’t have had me around all these years.""
Despite the drama, Pauline said that she still has affection in her heart for her alleged abuser. ""I loved him and I still love him. In a weird way, I know you might judge me, but it’s like best friend meets boyfriend meets dad.""

Prosecution rests in R Kelly’s trial-fixing and child pornography case,"US prosecutors have rested their case against R Kelly after presenting two weeks of evidence in their effort to show that the singer enticed under-age girls for sex, produced child pornography and successfully rigged his 2008 state trial.
Among the last prosecution witnesses was a 42-year-old woman who went by the pseudonym Nia, who was the fourth accuser to give evidence against the Grammy Award-winning singer at the trial in his home town of Chicago.
The highlight of prosecutors’ case was evidence from a 37-year-old woman who used the pseudonym Jane, and described Kelly sexually abusing her hundreds of times, starting in 1998 when she was 14 and Kelly was around 30.

Jane’s evidence is vital to the charge accusing Kelly of fixing his 2008 child pornography trial, at which he was acquitted.

She said Kelly and his associates threatened and paid off her and her parents so they lied to a grand jury before the trial.
Kelly’s legal team now gets its chance to attack the government’s case. His lawyers have not said whether he will give evidence.
The 55-year-old did not give evidence at his earlier federal trial in New York, where a judge sentenced him in June to 30 years in prison for racketeering and sex trafficking.
A conviction in Chicago could add years to that sentence.
Closing arguments in the federal trial in Chicago are expected next week.
Kelly’s 2008 state trial revolved around a video prosecutors said showed him sexually abusing Jane. She did not give evidence at that trial but told jurors this month that she was the child in the video and Kelly was the man.
The singer sold millions of albums even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s.

Ook zei ze de zanger te hebben betrapt met haar beste vriendin die destijds 15 was. Volgens Pauline werden ze samen gedwongen tot onder meer trio's en het opnemen van seksfilmpjes. Een andere vrouw, die onder de schuilnaam Tracy getuigde, verklaarde tussen haar 16e en 18e door Kelly te zijn misbruikt.
De rechtszaak tegen de zanger in Chicago begon enkele weken geleden. Hij staat daar terecht voor meerdere aanklachten van seksueel misbruik van minderjarigen en voor onder meer het vervaardigen van kinderporno. Een vermeend slachtoffer kwam eerder in de zaak al aan het woord. Naar verwachting volgen er later nog twee.
Kelly, die sinds 2019 vastzit, werd eind juni in New York al schuldig bevonden voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken. De zanger wordt al sinds de jaren negentig beschuldigd van (kinder)misbruik, maar heeft zelf altijd volgehouden onschuldig te zijn.",2022-08-29T12:51:00Z,https://www.telegraaf.nl,Telegraaf.nl

Federal prosecutors could rest their case in chief against R. Kelly this week as the disgraced R&B singer’s trial moves into its second half.
Before the prosecution rests, jurors are expected to hear from four more women who say Kelly sexually abused them when they were underage. The trial’s first week focused on another Kelly accuser, “Jane,” who identified herself as the girl being sexually abused by Kelly in three separate videos from the 1990s.

One of those videos became the subject of Kelly’s 2008 Cook County trial, during which he was acquitted of child-pornography charges — because, prosecutors now allege, Kelly and his associates went to great lengths to keep “Jane” quiet and recover other incriminating footage.
Witnesses last week largely focused on those efforts. Three people testified that Kelly’s team paid them to bring him videos of his homemade child pornography while he was awaiting his Cook County trial. Defense attorneys, during lengthy cross-examinations, have challenged their stories as inconsistent and tried to paint them as unreliable extortionists.

Kelly, 55, is charged with 13 counts of production of child pornography, conspiracy to produce child pornography and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Also on trial are former Kelly associates Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.

R. Kelly's Daughter Lost Record Deals Because Of His Reputation,"R. Kelly's alleged actions have managed to affect the lives of many people. From his friends and family to his fans, thousands have been made aware of the damage he's reportedly done to those in his life. While a lot of women have told their stories in the past, one person has decided to speak on her experience-- his daughter.
Joann Kelly sat down with her mother, Drea Kelly, to do an interview with Majic 107.5, an Atlanta radio station. During their talk, she explained how hard it has been to establish her own identity. ""A lot of people don't know,"" she stated, ""I do music, I do visual arts-- I went to school for it."" She explained that her talents are often overlooked because of who her parents are.

Following her statement, the interviewer asked how her relatives impacted her music career, to which she explained that it both helped and harmed her. ""The experience has been, ‘You’re only getting this because of who your parents are,’ and then, ‘You’re not getting this because of who your parents are,'” she told the host.
Joann later revealed that she had lost out on opportunities simply because of her last name. ""From 13 up until 24 I’ve been trying to get into the music business,"" she admitted. She even recalled a time that she flew to Los Angeles and was prepared to sign the paperwork but the opportunity was seized once someone found out who she was.
When asked how many times she'd been in that predicament, Joann replied, ""A good amount.""

"GOP super PAC canceling ads in Arizona, Alaska","(The Hill) – A Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is canceling advertisements in Arizona less than three months out from the midterm elections, a possible sign of problems for the Trump-backed GOP candidate challenging Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.).
The Senate Leadership Fund called off its advertisement reservations that were set to air in Arizona between Sept. 6 and Oct. 3, according to AdImpact.
The cancellation totaled about $8 million, according to Politico, which is roughly half of what the PAC had initially planned to run in the Grand Canyon State. Advertisements from the group are now set to begin in the beginning of October instead of early fall.
The decrease in advertising money comes as Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters continues to struggle in his bid against Kelly, who remains ahead in FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls, 50.3% to 42%.
Former President Trump and GOP mega-donor Peter Thiel both support Masters’ candidacy, but other Republicans feared he would be a weaker opponent to Kelly.
Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law said the change was in part due to the $28 million ad buy the PAC made in Ohio last week to bolster Republican nominee J.D. Vance, who is running against Rep. Tim Ryan (D) for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R).
Ryan and Vance appear to be in a close race in Ohio, a state the GOP had hoped would be more safely in its grasp.
“We’re leaving the door wide open in Arizona, but we want to move additional resources to other offensive opportunities that have become increasingly competitive, as well as an unexpected expense in Ohio,” Law told Politico.
“We think the fundamentals of this election strongly favor Republicans, we see multiple paths to winning the majority, and we are going to invest heavily and strategically to achieve that goal,” he added.
The super PAC is also slashing advertising in Alaska, where Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is running for reelection, according to Politico. The incumbent advanced to the general election, along with Trump-backed candidate Kelly Tshibaka.
Murkowski secured roughly 44% of the vote, while Tshibaka won 39% support.
The advertising dollar decrease in Alaska — roughly $1.7 million, according to Politico — is a sign that the party is confident with the incumbent’s odds, Law said. The super PAC’s ads supporting the candidate are set to begin on Sept. 20.
“We are all-in for Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski is in a very strong position and based on that decided to push back our start date,” Law told Politico.
The shift in advertisement funding comes as odds of flipping the Senate red in November appear to be diminishing.
In Kentucky last week, McConnell told reporters Republicans had a better chance of winning control of the House than the Senate, pointing to “candidate quality” — a veiled reference to Masters, Vance and Trump-backed nominees in Pennsylvania and Georgia.
“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell said when asked about his midterm expectations.
“Right now, we have a 50-50 Senate and a 50-50 country, but I think when all is said and done this fall, we’re likely to have an extremely close Senate, either our side up slightly or their side up slightly,” he added.
The statement came in stark contrast to McConnell’s comments in November, when he said the midterm races would be “very good” for Republicans.
According to FiveThirtyEight, Democrats are favored to win control of the upper chamber over Republicans, 65% to 35%.",2022-08-27T14:12:19Z,https://www.wcia.com,wcia.com

"GOP super PAC canceling ads in Arizona, Alaska","A Republican super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is canceling advertisements in Arizona less than three months out from the midterm elections, a possible sign of problems for the Trump-backed GOP candidate challenging Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.).
The Senate Leadership Fund called off its advertisement reservations that were set to air in Arizona between Sept. 6 and Oct. 3, according to AdImpact.
The cancellation totaled about $8 million, according to Politico, which is roughly half of what the PAC had initially planned to run in the Grand Canyon State. Advertisements from the group are now set to begin in the beginning of October instead of early fall.
The decrease in advertising money comes as Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters continues to struggle in his bid against Kelly, who remains ahead in FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls, 50.3 percent to 42 percent.
Former President Trump and GOP megadonor Peter Thiel both support Masters’s candidacy, but other Republicans feared he would be a weaker opponent to Kelly.
Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law said the change was in part due to the $28 million ad buy the PAC made in Ohio last week to bolster Republican nominee J.D. Vance, who is running against Rep. Tim Ryan (D) for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R).
Ryan and Vance appear to be in a close race in Ohio, a state the GOP had hoped would be more safely in its grasp.
“We’re leaving the door wide open in Arizona, but we want to move additional resources to other offensive opportunities that have become increasingly competitive, as well as an unexpected expense in Ohio,” Law told Politico.
“We think the fundamentals of this election strongly favor Republicans, we see multiple paths to winning the majority, and we are going to invest heavily and strategically to achieve that goal,” he added.
The super PAC is also slashing advertising in Alaska, where Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is running for reelection, according to Politico. The incumbent advanced to the general election, along with Trump-backed candidate Kelly Tshibaka.
Murkowski secured roughly 44 percent of the vote, while Tshibaka won 39 percent support.
The advertising dollar decrease in Alaska — roughly $1.7 million, according to Politico — is a sign that the party is confident with the incumbent’s odds, Law said. The super PAC’s ads supporting the candidate are set to begin on Sept. 20.
“We are all-in for Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski is in a very strong position and based on that decided to push back our start date,” Law told Politico.
The shift in advertisement funding comes as odds of flipping the Senate red in November appear to be diminishing.
In Kentucky last week, McConnell told reporters Republicans had a better chance of winning control of the House than the Senate, pointing to “candidate quality” — a veiled reference to Masters, Vance and Trump-backed nominees in Pennsylvania and Georgia.
“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell said when asked about his midterm expectations.
“Right now, we have a 50-50 Senate and a 50-50 country, but I think when all is said and done this fall, we’re likely to have an extremely close Senate, either our side up slightly or their side up slightly,” he added.
The statement was a stark contrast to McConnell’s comments in November, when he said the midterm races would be “very good” for Republicans.
According to FiveThirtyEight, Democrats are favored to win control of the upper chamber over Republicans, 65 percent to 35 percent.",2022-08-26T21:39:36Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
"Senate GOP super PAC cancels ad buys in Arizona, Alaska","The McConnell-backed super PAC’s strategic change is in part a reaction to its massive $28 million commitment in Ohio, where GOP nominee J.D. Vance is facing a strong challenge from Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio). The organization said it will reallocate the money elsewhere and is not planning to totally pull of out Arizona at the moment, as Kelly leads Masters in essentially every recent public poll.
“We’re leaving the door wide open in Arizona, but we want to move additional resources to other offensive opportunities that have become increasingly competitive, as well as an unexpected expense in Ohio,” said Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law. “We think the fundamentals of this election strongly favor Republicans, we see multiple paths to winning the majority, and we are going to invest heavily and strategically to achieve that goal.”
Still, there are signs that the GOP is keeping Arizona on the table. OneNation, a GOP nonprofit affiliated with the super PAC, included the state in a new round of ad buys, according to CNN.
Both Masters and Vance were supported in their Republican primaries by GOP donor Peter Thiel and former President Donald Trump. It’s not clear whether Thiel will help either candidate in the general election.
Absent further GOP investment, the super PAC’s move will likely leave Kelly and his allies with a huge money advantage this fall. Kelly and Democratic groups have more than $40 million reserved for the fall, while Republicans had about $18 million before the super PAC shifted money away from the state, according to AdImpact.
While the change in Arizona might raise questions about Republicans’ view of Masters’s chances, Law said the decision to cut two weeks — or about $1.7 million in advertising — to boost Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is a vote of confidence in her. Murkowski advanced to the top-four general election with about 45 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for Trump-backed Kelly Tshibaka; the general election will be decided by ranked-choice voting.
“We are all-in for Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski is in a very strong position and based on that decided to push back our start date,” Law said. Ads supporting Murkowski’s bid will now begin Sept. 20.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee separately canceled millions in ads earlier this month, planning to reprogram them to get more efficient buys alongside GOP candidates but sparking some skepticism about the group’s strategy. A spokesperson for the McConnell-backed super PAC said its moves in Arizona and Alaska shouldn’t be taken as a sign of financial trouble and that “we’re currently several million ahead of where we were for the month of August at this point in 2020.”

Kansas City man testifies about returning copy of purported R. Kelly sex tape to singer’s associates,"In this courtroom sketch, the front of the courtroom is blocked off as a sexually graphic video clip is played for the jury during R. Kelly's trial in federal court Aug. 19, 2022, in Chicago. (Cheryl Cook / AP)
The Kansas City man at the center of an alleged scheme to hide a sex tape showing R. Kelly in a threesome with a 14-year-old girl told a federal jury Friday that he only handed over a partial copy of the tape to Kelly’s associates at first because he “didn’t think they’d know the difference.”
Keith Murrell, 45, is a key witness for prosecutors, who are trying to prove that Kelly and his two co-defendants, Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, conspired to buy back incriminating tapes and hide years of Kelly’s sexual misconduct.

Murrell’s testimony, which capped the second week of Kelly’s trial at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, helped shore up key elements of the indictment. But he also contradicted another central witness, his friend Lisa Van Allen, on several important points, including why she sent him the tape, the number of sexual encounters it depicted, and whether money was the motivating factor for returning it to Kelly.
Murrell walked into court wearing a blue suit and dark sunglasses. He remained somber-faced and seemed slightly nervous, a contrast with his friend and previous witness, Charles Freeman, who was laid-back and smiling on the stand.

Testifying in a Missouri drawl, Murrell said he met Kelly in the mid-1990s when he was in an R&B group named K-OS. After impressing Kelly with a song they sang into his voicemail, they were flown to Chicago to record with Kelly’s label in 1997, he said.
It was at that time Murrell said he met Van Allen, a romantic partner of Kelly’s who testified this week that she participated in threesomes with Kelly and his then-underage goddaughter, which Kelly recorded on video.
Murrell said he eventually moved back to Kansas City in the early 2000s. While he was living there, Van Allen sent him a videotape to “hold” for her, which he said he watched right away. “It was Lisa, Rob and another girl having sex,” he testified.
Murrell said he showed the video to several friends — including Freeman — but never gave it to anyone else. He was stunned in 2007, he said, when McDavid called him out of the blue and said they knew he had a tape.
Brown later called him and said to bring it to Chicago, but before he went, Murrell made a copy of about an 8-to-10-minute “snippet” of the tape to bring. “I didn’t think they’d know the difference,” he testified.
After flying to Chicago with the copy of the tape, he met at a downtown hotel with Brown and McDavid, where he failed a polygraph test when asked if he’d made any copies. Murrell said McDavid gave him $20,000 in cash and told him to go back to Kansas City and get the original tape, and if he did so he’d get a total reward of $100,000. He said McDavid let him know that “they weren’t playing.”
Murrell later went back to Chicago with the original tape, he said. When he arrived, Brown told him he had “the golden egg, or something like that,” Murrell testified. He handed the tape to McDavid, who arranged for him to take a second lie detector test.
After he passed, McDavid “told me ‘Thank you’ and he shook my hand and gave me a hug. And then he gave me the money also.” Murrell says it was a bag with $80,000 in cash.

In her testimony Thursday, Van Allen sobbed when she described how McDavid threatened her after she had failed a polygraph test about the tape, telling her “they should have murked me from the beginning” — that is, they should have killed her.
Murrell said that Van Allen never told him about that alleged threat. He also was asked on cross-examination whether McDavid had ever threatened him. After initially saying no, Murrell said McDavid drew his attention to a large member of Kelly’s security team who was also in the room.
“He said if I didn’t come back, this guy right here would come see me,” Murrell said.
Murrell acknowledged on cross-examination that he asked Van Allen to send him the tape because he wanted to see it, and that she never told him there was anything improper or illegal on it.
When he viewed it, it didn’t look like anything criminal, he said. And there was only one sexual encounter on the tape, Murrell said — whereas Van Allen has testified there were three separate scenes, two of which involved just Kelly and his young goddaughter.
Earlier Friday, Van Allen’s continued cross-examination got off to an extraordinarily contentious start. Within 15 minutes, the exchange with Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean had grown so argumentative and circular that the judge intervened, and within about 20 minutes the witness had broken down in tears.

Van Allen, 42, acknowledged at the start she was “exhausted” and did not want to come to court Friday after spending about five hours on the stand the day before.
Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean repeatedly noted that Van Allen had for years said she first met Kelly when she was 17, but at this trial acknowledged she was 18. Authorities had informed her that the music video shoot where they met was filmed after her 18th birthday.
Bonjean showed increasing exasperation with Van Allen’s failure to nail down a timeline for when exactly she met Kelly and how old she was at the time. At one point, as Van Allen again said she was confused by a question, Bonjean threw her hands up in the air and looked toward the ceiling, letting out a heavy sigh.
“Why would I do all that math when I’m trying to tell the truth?” Van Allen said, growing frustrated. “... When I testified against him it wasn’t for me. It was about Jane.”
Bonjean noted that Jane was underage when Van Allen admittedly had sexual contact with her and Kelly: “You’re here testifying for her? This is the person you sexually abused?”
Van Allen’s bottom lip began to quiver. She reached for a box of tissues and started dabbing at her eyes. Then she broke down sobbing.

“I’m not proud of that. I don’t know what woman would be proud of that,” she said through tears. “But I am here to admit to my wrongdoings and to hold him accountable for what he’s done, so you can sit here and try to make me the bad guy all you want.”
As Van Allen sobbed for several uncomfortable minutes, Bonjean stood at the lectern with her arms crossed. “Let me know when you have composed yourself,” she said.
Bonjean also questioned Van Allen about how many threesomes she had with Kelly and where and when and why. She showed Van Allen a statement she made to authorities in 2019, in which she said she participated in the threesomes because she felt bad that Kelly had been molested when he was young.
With that, jurors have learned about that traumatic part of Kelly’s history without Kelly needing to take the stand.
Van Allen said she reached out to Kelly for his help in getting the incriminating video back, but then Kelly volunteered to give her money if she could go recover it. That isn’t logical, Bonjean implied, saying: “This doesn’t make sense unless it was all about money, Ms. Van Allen.”
“It makes sense to not want a sex tape out there. Especially with a minor,” Van Allen said.

After a little more than two hours of questioning, Bonjean told the judge she had “nothing further.”
“Good,” Van Allen said loudly into the microphone, prompting Bonjean to whirl around and say, “Oooh!”

Van Allen gave her a big smile.
On redirect examination, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Julien read for jurors segments of Van Allen’s testimony from Kelly’s 2008 trial, to show that her story had remained consistent and that she was not motivated by publicity. Van Allen, at that point, did not have a book deal, and had not been on television.
The prosecutor’s final questions tried to combat defense attorneys’ insinuations that Van Allen’s displays of emotions were just a phony show for jurors.
“Were your emotions yesterday fake?” Julien asked.

‘I’ve seen a lot of disturbing things’: Meet the courtroom illustrator who sketched Ghislaine Maxwell and R Kelly,"“She wore a black-and-white power suit, double-breasted and very graphic, with big lapels outlined in white. You could say she was making a statement.”
Elizabeth Williams could have been describing an uptown matron smartly turned out for lunch at Sant Ambroeus in the US. But the subject was Gloria Allred, the women’s rights lawyer, whose image she captured in June as Allred stood in a federal courtroom in Manhattan awaiting sentencing of singer R Kelly for racketeering and sex trafficking.
Williams is a courtroom artist with a canny eye for style. A former fashion illustrator, she is tasked with rendering charged portraits of accused killers, mob chieftains, white collar criminals, sex offenders and, as often, their alleged victims, with a measure of fidelity and journalistic flair.
The cut of a suit, the stony glare, “those are the kinds of things you want to catch,” Williams says. “Effectively, I’m a visual reporter. I’ve been doing this long enough that I know when something is newsworthy.” (Williams declined to give her age.)
[ R&B singer R Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison for sex crimes ]
She was animated, even irreverent, as she conducted a tour of her studio, a former beauty spa, its shampoo basins and outsize mirrors having given way long ago to a spartan arrangement of computer stations and work tables.
The walls, in contrast, were covered in strikingly colourful likenesses of Allred, Martha Stewart and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was tried in November for sex trafficking and procuring underage girls for financier Jeffrey Epstein. Together the portraits form a veritable rogues’ gallery sketched by Williams during the course of her decades–long career.

Some of those portraits, and others dating from the early 1980s – former automobile executive John DeLorean, Mick Jagger, Russian spy Anna Chapman and Bernard Madoff, among them – were gathered by Williams and writer Sue Russell in The Illustrated Courtroom, 50 Years of Court Art.
An updated edition published in June highlights Williams’ illustrations, including those of Harvey Weinstein, Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump, as well as the work of prominent courtroom artists like Bill Robles, Aggie Kenny, Howard Brodie and Richard Tomlinson. Wielding charcoals and brush pens in federal court, where cameras are not allowed, they have documented many of the most sensational US trials of the past 100 years.
“Just the presence of these skilled artists meant that something newsworthy was happening in that courtroom,” Linda Fairstein, the lawyer, novelist and former New York prosecutor, wrote in the foreword to the book’s first edition.
Fairstein went on to argue that in such highly publicised proceedings, “our memory of the moment of triumph or defeat was most likely a vision of the sketch created”.
Williams’ particular vision is built on a fusion of instinct and experience. Her clients, most often the Associated Press and CNBC, count on her, she knows, to convey the urgency, pageantry and intermittent shocks of live theatre.
When jurors at the Maxwell trial were shown an enlarged photograph of Epstein fondling Maxwell’s breast with his foot, “she was smiling at the camera like this was a fun thing to do”, Williams says, her eyes narrowing in a mix of consternation and amusement.

A scholar of human fancies and foibles, she studied fashion illustration at Parsons School of Design and pursued graduate studies at Otis College of Art and Design in San Francisco but did not earn a graduate degree.
At Parsons, her teachers – including Steven Meisel, the fashion illustrator turned photographer – encouraged her to develop speed, fluidity and the emotional antennae that help her commemorate moments of levity, distress and untrammeled vanity.
[ Ghislaine Maxwell: How the publishing baron’s daughter became Epstein’s procurer ]
She is well aware that dressing for an audience of jurors, journalists and curiosity seekers can be a performance, a bid for sympathy, credibility or, simply, admiring attention. None of this was lost on Martha Stewart, who during her 2004 trial for securities fraud seemed to have consciously styled herself as a portrait of feminine rectitude.
“In her dour tailored suit and schoolmarm shoes with big thick heels, she looked plain, plain, plain,” Williams says.
Maxwell, at her trial, wore a balloon-sleeve turtleneck sweater. As Williams recalls: “It was either heavy wool or cashmere, a $1,000 sweater, I’d guess, that said ‘understated rich lady’.”

During DeLorean’s 1982 arraignment on drug conspiracy charges, his wife, Christina Ferrara, a former cover girl and television personality, assigned herself a more flamboyant role wearing a royal blue pantsuit with a spray of ruffles at her throat. On another day, “she wore a big puffy gingham dress, with her hair up in a little tie”, Williams says. “She wore a new dress every day. Her husband was the one on trial, but she was kind of making a play for herself.”
Which brings to mind Anna Sorokin, the society scammer who snared attention in a New York state court in 2019 when she hired a stylist to dress her on various days in a python-patterned shirtdress, a sheer Saint Laurent blouse and Victoria Beckham trousers, and a succession of little white frocks, transforming the courtroom into her personal catwalk.
Such scenes pose challenges no more or less exacting than sketching a fashion show. “The courtroom is more dramatic,” Williams says, “but in each instance, you’ve got to get an overall sense of design, movement and style, and any kind of specific detail to create a mood.” There is plenty of pressure, but she likes it that way. “What I’ve learned is that the drawing is not here in my head,” she says. “It happens out there.” She makes a sweeping gesture toward the far end of the room. “That’s where your focus must be.”
She works with a brush pen, starting with a series of sketches that isolate her subject’s eyes or the way that they covers her mouth with her fingers, “until finally I understand that face well enough to really start to draw”.
In her practice, she plays by the rules. Among guidelines set out by the Associated Press, “individuals and objects must be pictured as they were in the courtroom.” Also, “no artistic license should be taken with regard to facial expression or personal characteristics of subjects”.

Her work can take an emotional toll. “I’ve seen a lot of disturbing things, especially when I’m watching the victims,” she says. During the Maxwell trial, she sketched one young woman, a witness who was not identified by name, covering her anguished features with heavily jewelled fingers.
“That image haunts me,” Williams says. “There is anger, embarrassment – that’s what courtrooms are. And always, there’s tension.”
As an antidote to stress and to supplement her income, Williams has embarked an incongruous, if far cheerier, sideline. As a wedding illustrator, she finds herself sketching portraits of couples sharing moments of affection, intimacy and unconcealed joy.
“Look at these two, the way they look at each other,” she said, pointing out a sketch of newly-weds, pinned to a wall. “They’re so happy, so jovial, these people. And they’re dressed in beautiful clothes. What more can you ask?”
Inevitably, though, she returns to the courtroom. When Maxwell appeared in court in June to make her sentencing statement, she wore a dun-coloured T-shirt and trousers and sober-looking spectacles, her hair parted to show silver roots. Williams memorialised the scene and, with it, a second portrait of Maxwell being escorted from lock-up in leg shackles.
“It was such a contrast to that day last fall when she strolled into court in a statement sweater,” she said. “What a comedown.” – This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",2022-08-26T04:00:00Z,https://www.irishtimes.com,The Irish Times
Witness says R. Kelly manager threatened her over stolen video,"A former girlfriend of R. Kelly wept on the witness stand Thursday as she testified that a Kelly business manager told her in 2007 she should have been killed for causing the R&B star so much trouble by stealing a video from a gym bag full of recordings of Kelly having sex with women and girls.
Prosecution witness Lisa Van Allen said she rummaged through the bag on a rare occasion when Kelly left it unattended at a studio one day in 2000. She said she then watched the videos one after the other on a VHS player. She took one that, among other footage, showed Van Allen, Kelly and a younger girl who testified against Kelly last week under the pseudonym, “Jane,” having sex.
Van Allen, 42, is the only witness so far to have testified both at Kelly’s ongoing federal trial as well as at his 2008 state child pornography trial, at which Kelly was acquitted.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar singer, faces charges in his hometown of child pornography and enticement of minors for sex. The 55-year-old and co-defendant Derrel McDavid, the former business manager, are also charged with rigging the 2008 trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence.
Kelly was handed a 30-year prison sentence by a federal judge in New York in June for convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. If convicted in U.S. District Court in Chicago, he could see years added to that sentence.
Van Allen, crying and reaching for tissues during her testimony Wednesday, said it was McDavid who told her in 2007 at a Chicago lawyer’s office that a polygraph had indicated she wasn’t truthful about the video she handed back. Kelly and his insiders were worried Van Allen had made other copies.
“He said that I failed [the lie-detector], and that they should have murked me from the beginning,” she testified, using a slang word for killed. She said she took the comment as a threat.
Van Allen sounded shaken, too, while recalling McDavid’s response to her when she told him she was going to tell Kelly about McDavid’s threat.
“He said [Kelly] knew everything that was going on,” she said.
Kelly’s 2008 trial revolved a around a different video that state prosecutors said showed Kelly abusing the girl called Jane at the Chicago federal trial. After acquitting Kelly in 2008, jurors said they had no choice because the girl did not take the witness stand at that trial. Last week, Jane did testify that she was the child in the video and Kelly was the adult man. The evidence at the current trial includes several videos.
Van Allen, who said she began a nine-year relationship with Kelly in 1998 when she was 18, said Kelly was obsessed with control, prohibiting her from speaking to other men and other men from speaking to her. She told jurors Kelly would sometimes hit her because, as she put it, “I wouldn’t listen to daddy.”
She testified she only learned after Kelly filmed himself having sex with Van Allen and Jane that Jane had only been 14 at that time.
Asked by a prosecutor how she felt as she viewed the videos at the studio in 2000, Van Allen responded, “Disgusted.” She also recalled being nervous Kelly might walk back into the room at any moment, knowing he’d be furious if he saw what she was doing.
The same video she took from Kelly also had footage of Kelly sexually abusing Jane at two different locations, Van Allen testified. She said she took the tape because she never wanted Kelly or anyone else to see it. She said she decided in 2007 to return the tape she had taken and that, while she insisted she didn’t pressure Kelly for money, he offered to pay $250,000 for it.
In cross examination, a defense attorney for McDavid, Beau Brindley, asked Van Allen that if her goal was to prevent anyone from ever seeing it, why didn’t she simply destroy it in 2000. She answered, “I could have if that crossed my mind.”
Brindley sought to cast doubts about her account that McDavid threatened her. His voice soaring, Brindley asked Van Allen if she was “prepared to admit” that her claim McDavid made a death threat “is a lie?”
“I am not prepared to admit that,” she shot back.
He asked her if she ever had any indication McDavid was “a murderous accountant” prior to their 2007 conversation about the lie-detector test.
“Not until he said they should have murked [killed] me,” she answered.

Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a superstar singer, faces charges in his hometown of child pornography and enticement of minors for sex. The 55-year-old and co-defendant Derrel McDavid, the former business manager, are also charged with rigging the 2008 trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence.

Kelly was handed a 30-year prison sentence by a federal judge in New York in June for convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. If convicted in U.S. District Court in Chicago, he could see years added to that sentence.
Van Allen, crying and reaching for tissues during her testimony Wednesday, said it was McDavid who told her in 2007 at a Chicago lawyer’s office that a polygraph had indicated she wasn’t truthful about the video she handed back. Kelly and his insiders were worried Van Allen had made other copies.
“He said that I failed (the lie-detector), and that they should have murked me from the beginning,” she testified, using a slang word for killed. She said she took the comment as a threat.
Van Allen sounded shaken, too, while recalling McDavid’s response to her when she told him she was going to tell Kelly about McDavid’s threat.
“He said (Kelly) knew everything that was going on,” she said.
Kelly’s 2008 trial revolved a around a different video that state prosecutors said showed Kelly abusing the girl called Jane at the Chicago federal trial. After acquitting Kelly in 2008, jurors said they had no choice because the girl did not take the witness stand at that trial. Last week, Jane did testify that she was the child in the video and Kelly was the adult man. The evidence at the current trial includes several videos.
Van Allen, who said she began a nine-year relationship with Kelly in 1998 when she was 18, said Kelly was obsessed with control, prohibiting her from speaking to other men and other men from speaking to her. She told jurors Kelly would sometimes hit her because, as she put it, “I wouldn’t listen to daddy.”
She testified she only learned after Kelly filmed himself having sex with Van Allen and Jane that Jane had only been 14 at that time.
Asked by a prosecutor how she felt as she viewed the videos at the studio in 2000, Van Allen responded, “Disgusted.” She also recalled being nervous Kelly might walk back into the room at any moment, knowing he’d be furious if he saw what she was doing.

The same video she took from Kelly also had footage of Kelly sexually abusing Jane at two different locations, Van Allen testified. She said she took the tape because she never wanted Kelly or anyone else to see it. She said she decided in 2007 to return the tape she had taken and that, while she insisted she didn’t pressure Kelly for money, he offered to pay $250,000 for it.
In cross examination, a defense attorney for McDavid, Beau Brindley, asked Van Allen that if her goal was to prevent anyone from ever seeing it, why didn’t she simply destroy it in 2000. She answered, “I could have if that crossed my mind.”
Brindley sought to cast doubts about her account that McDavid threatened her. His voice soaring, Brindley asked Van Allen if she was “prepared to admit” that her claim McDavid made a death threat “is a lie?”

“I am not prepared to admit that,” she shot back.
He asked her if she ever had any indication McDavid was “a murderous accountant” prior to their 2007 conversation about the lie-detector test.
“Not until he said they should have murked (killed) me,” she answered.

Testimony resumes Thursday in R. Kelly trial as case nears halfway mark,"In this courtroom sketch, the front of the courtroom is blocked off as a sexually graphic video clip is played for the jury during R. Kelly's trial in federal court Aug. 19, 2022, in Chicago. (Cheryl Cook / AP)
Prosecutors on Thursday will continue presenting their case against R. Kelly as the disgraced R&B star’s federal child pornography trial nears the halfway mark.
Jurors in the closely watched case have so far heard from 13 witnesses, including an alleged victim who testified last week Kelly videotaped sexual encounters with her when she was just 14, then pressured and ultimately paid off her and her family to remain silent. Clips from three of those videos were shown to the jury on Friday.

This week has been dominated by another key prosecution witness, Charles Freeman, a Kansas City merchandiser and who told the jury Kelly and his associates agreed to pay him up to a million dollars in the early 2000s to hunt down other incriminating videos before they could be made public.
The plot as described by Freeman on direct examination Tuesday spanned almost a decade, and unfolded in cities from Chicago to Kansas City and Atlanta, at Kelly’s music studio, concert venues and even the singer’s sprawling Olympia Fields mansion, where Freeman said he was told to strip naked and get in a pool to prove he wasn’t wearing a wire.

But that account came under withering scrutiny during nearly five hours of cross-examination Wednesday, with attorneys for Kelly and his co-defendants trying to paint Freeman as a liar and opportunist who has given inconsistent accounts about the conspiracy over the years.
Freeman was a key witness to the heart of the indictment alleging there was a conspiracy to cover up sexual misconduct by Kelly.
He has recounted his version of the two-decades-old events several times in recent years, including at least three under oath: Before a Cook County grand jury, in an affidavit for a federal grand jury, and now at Kelly’s trial.
All those accounts differ from each other, some in significant ways, and lawyers for both Kelly and McDavid pressed him on the discrepancies with increasing agitation. The wide-ranging inconsistencies included where Freeman first learned the whereabouts of the tape, how many tapes he took, when he learned what was on the tape and who was involved in the initial conversations about retrieving it.

Defense attorneys also delved into another intriguing twist: Freeman, who had remained silent for nearly 20 years, was initially brought to investigators’ attention in 2019 by California attorney Michael Avenatti, who has since been convicted of federal crimes of his own and sentenced to prison.
Freeman at first denied that Avenatti was with him during his Cook County grand jury appearance in February 2019, but acquiesced after Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, had him review a transcript showing he was in the room.
Neither side has confirmed whether Avenatti will be called as a witness in the trial.
Kelly, 55, is charged with 13 counts of production of child pornography, conspiracy to produce child pornography and conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Also on trial are McDavid and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.
The trial is expected to last about four weeks. Prosecutors on Wednesday told U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber that they had hoped to rest their case in chief by the middle of next week, but the lengthy testimony by Freeman may have set that plan back.

R. Kelly’s Lawyers Claim Key Government Witness Tried to Extort Singer,"Defense lawyers at R. Kelly’s child pornography trial in Chicago sought Wednesday (Aug. 24) to portray a key government witness as a liar and extortionist, contending the man first approached the R&B star in 2001 and demanded that Kelly pay $1 million or he’d go public with video that could put Kelly in serious legal peril.

Those assertions came during seven hours of often blistering cross-examination of Charles Freeman, a former merchandizing agent for Kelly who testified Tuesday that it was Kelly who first approached him, eventually offering Freeman $1 million to recover a VHS tape featuring Kelly.
“Your entire relationship with (Kelly) centered around stealing from him and lying to him,” lead Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean, raising her voice, told Freeman Wednesday. Minutes later, she added, “You were part of a shakedown scheme, right?” Freeman shot back, “No!” He also said, “I am not a thief.”
Federal prosecutors charged Kelly with production of child pornography based in part on that recording, which they say shows him sexually abusing a 14-year-old. He and co-defendant Derrel McDavid are also accused of successfully rigging Kelly’s 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence.
Freeman’s testimony at this trial helps buttress prosecutors’ claims that both Kelly and McDavid knew that videos Kelly had lost track of in the early 2000s were incriminating and could lead to his conviction at the 2008 trial.
McDavid’s lawyer, Beau Brindley, started the cross-examination Wednesday by pacing, waving grand jury transcripts at Freeman and several times telling the 52-year-old to “be quiet and listen” to his questions as he sought to tear down Freeman’s credibility.
“How many times have you told lies about videotapes connected to Robert Kelly?” Brindley asked, using Kelly’s full first name. “It’s multiple times right?”
Freeman agreed it was.
Freeman, who is testifying under an immunity agreement, also agreed when Brindley asked if it was difficult “to trust a person who lies … who will cheat and steal to get money.”
Kelly, 55, was handed a 30-year prison sentence by a federal judge in New York in June for convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. If convicted in U.S. District Court in Chicago, he could see years added to that sentence.
Brindley also accused Freeman of lying when he testified that he found the video Kelly was looking for in Atlanta in 2001 and when he said he didn’t know its contents until he watched it later the same day. Brindley suggested Freeman never actually went to Atlanta and that he already possessed a potentially compromising video of Kelly, using it to extort Kelly.
“That’s how all this happened, isn’t it?” Brindley asked. Freeman said that wasn’t true.
Freeman said money wasn’t his only motivation for agreeing to hunt down the video, insisting he also wanted to help his friend, Kelly, whom he had known since around 1990.
Freeman conceded that he kept copies of videos for nearly 20 years. Not until a lawyer warned him in 2019 that police were poised to arrest Freeman for possession of child pornography did he finally turn them over to law enforcement, he testified.
After Freeman smiled as Brindley questioned him about holding onto child pornography for so long, Brindley asked: “Is this funny? Are you having a good time?” Freeman responded, “Yes, I am.”
“You aren’t upset with what you’ve done?” Brindley asked.
“I am not,” Freeman answered.
After acquitting Kelly in 2008, some jurors told reporters they had no choice because the girl — who then was in her 20s — did not take the witness stand to confirm it was her in the video that was at the heart of the state’s case.

Witness: Desperate R. Kelly offered $1M for return of video,"Michael Tarm, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - A former merchandizing agent for R. Kelly testified Tuesday that the singer offered him $1 million to find a VHS tape featuring Kelly as prosecutors sought to persuade jurors that Kelly was desperate to recover the missing recording, knowing it could land him in legal peril if it fell into the hands of law enforcement.
Based in part on that recording, which prosecutors say shows the R&B star sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl, Kelly faces charges that include production of child pornography. He is also accused of fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and endeavoring to conceal video evidence.
Charles Freeman testified Tuesday that Kelly reached out to him in 2001 to ask him to hunt down the recording. Freeman, a 52-year-old from Kansas City, also explained how he pressured Kelly and his associates for years to pay him the full $1 million after Freeman found and returned the tape.
Freeman told jurors he didn't know the contents of the video until after he retrieved it from a home in Atlanta in 2001 and then slipped it into a VHS player at a friend's home later that day.
“I observed Robert Kelly with a young lady having sex,” he said.
When a prosecutor asked Freeman, who testified Tuesday under an immunity agreement, why it took him nearly two decades to turn the recording over to police that and other recordings of child pornography tied to Kelly, Freeman responded: “Because the police wasn't going to pay me a million dollars.”
Kelly, 55, is already serving a 30-year prison sentence imposed by a federal judge in New York in June for his 2021 convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. If convicted in Chicago, he could see years added to that sentence.
At his 2008 trial, at which Kelly was ultimately acquitted, state prosecutors described Kelly lugging a duffel bag full of his homemade child pornography tapes everywhere he went. Despite Kelly's efforts in the 1990s to keep them close, some leaked out or were stolen by disgruntled workers or friends, prosecutors said.
After acquitting Kelly in 2008, some jurors told reporters they had no choice but to find Kelly not guilty because the girl - who then was in her 20s - did not take the witness stand to confirm it was her in the video. Last week, she did testify at the federal trail in Chicago, saying she was the minor in the video and Kelly was the adult man.
But actually getting the $1 million Freeman said he was promised by Kelly became an all-consuming task that lasted years, he told jurors.
Soon after Freeman found the video, he met with two Kelly associates in 2001 at a Kansas City hotel expecting to receive the full payment, Freeman testified. When he walked into a room and saw two brown bags full of cash, he told jurors he knew right away it wasn't enough.
“That ain't no million dollars,” he recalled telling Kelly's people.
Freeman said he ended up leaving with one paper bag stuffed with $75,000 in cash after being assured he'd eventually get the full $1 million. Even after turning over the tape and getting partial payment, Freeman retained enormous leverage over Kelly, including the possibility that he could go public with what he knew.
Freeman described himself stalking Kelly at concerts to demand he pay the balance of the $1 million, threatening to go public with what he knew and filing lawsuits to squeeze Kelly to pay. He said each threat and lawsuit typically led to Kelly associates throwing more money at Freeman, sometimes literally.
Another time at R. Kelly's suburban Chicago home, Freeman said a Kelly associate and now co-defendant at the ongoing trial, Derrel McDavid, told Freeman to take off all his clothes and get into Kelly's swimming pool so he could be sure Freeman wasn't wearing a recording device for law enforcement.
“I ain't getting in no pool naked,” Freeman recalled telling McDavid. Freeman said he eventually did take off his shirt to show he wasn't wearing a wire.
Later, as he pulled out of a parking lot, McDavid gave Freeman another installment, tossing a brown bag with $100,000 in ten bundles of $10,000 through Freeman's open car window.
McDavid and another Kelly associate, Milton Brown, are on trial with Kelly. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.
Freeman testified that in late 2003 or early 2004, McDavid approached him again about recovering yet another tape that had gone missing from Kelly's collection. He said he told McDavid, “If I gotta recover another tape, you gotta pay me another million dollars.”
Freeman is expected to take the stand again Wednesday, when defense attorneys will have their chance to cross-examine him.",2022-08-24T20:25:31Z,https://www.cp24.com,CP24 Toronto
"R. Kelly Allegedly Offered $1M To Recover Incriminating Sex Tape With ""Young Lady"": Report","R. Kelly's trial in Chicago continues as he faces charges related to his 2008 child pornography trial. According to Billboard, a former merchandise manager for the singer took the stand on Tuesday and testified that Kelly attempted to pay $1M to retrieve an incriminating video. Charles Freeman told the court that Kelly came to him in an effort to track down the video recording featuring the singer, which prosecutors said showed Kelly engaging in sexual acts with a 14-year-old.

Freeman told the jury that Kelly reached out in 2001 with the $1M offer, though he testified that he chased down the singer and his team for years in order to get his payment in full. Freeman testified that he was unaware of the content of the tape when he went to get it at a home in Atlanta. However, he said he popped the tape into a VHS player later that day. ""I observed Robert Kelly with a young lady having sex,"" he said.
Prosecutors pressed Freeman, who took an immunity agreement, on why he took so long to turn the recordings over to the police. ""Because the police wasn't going to pay me a million dollars,"" he said.
Freeman also testified that a member of Kelly's entourage and co-defendant, Derrel McDavid, demanded he strip down and enter Kelly's swimming pool to ensure that he wasn't carrying a wire. He said he eventually took off his shirt before Freeman tossed a brown bag into his car with $100K in cash.
Freeman also added that McDavid tried to get him to retrieve another tape in either 2002 or 2003. ""If I gotta recover another tape, you gotta pay me another million dollars,"" he recalled telling McDavid.

R. Kelly soll eine Million Dollar für Beschaffung von Missbrauchsvideo geboten haben,"Kelly steht unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie unter Anklage. In einem vorangegangenen Verfahren im Jahr 2008 soll er zudem Zeugen bedroht und Beweismaterial unterschlagen haben.
Auf die Frage der Anklage, warum er fast zwei Jahrzehnte gebraucht habe, diese und andere mit R.

"R Kelly 'offered $1m for return of videotape', witness tells court","R Kelly offered $1m for the return of a videotape allegedly featuring an underage girl, a former merchandising agent has claimed at the singer's latest trial.
Kelly, who is serving a 30-year prison sentence after being convicted in New York in 2021 on charges of using his fame to sexually abuse fans, is now appearing in court in his hometown of Chicago accused of several other federal charges.
The most serious charge is conspiracy to obstruct justice by allegedly successfully rigging a 2008 trial on state child pornography charges - stemming from a purported video of him and a girl having sex when she was underage - at which he was acquitted.
He denies any wrongdoing.
On Tuesday, prosecutors introduced evidence apparently demonstrating his alleged desperation in the early 2000s to recover a video after it went missing.
Testifying in court, former merchandising agent Charles Freeman said he located the tape and returned it to the singer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly.
Asked why it took him two decades to hand the recording over to the authorities, he said that police were not going to give him $1m (about £845,750 today) for the footage - unlike Kelly, he said.
The charges Kelly faces in Chicago include production of child pornography, partly based on this recording.
Earlier in the trial, a woman identified only as ""Jane"", now 37 - whom prosecutors say is the girl filmed in the alleged video - told the court that Kelly had sex with her ""hundreds of times"" before she was 18.

On Monday, the woman's mother, who used the pseudonym ""Susan"" in court, gave evidence about Kelly's 2008 trial.
She said she lied about the singer ahead of it as she and her husband feared for their lives and their daughter's well-being.
""We were very, very frightened,"" she told jurors.
Under cross-examination, Kelly's attorney Jennifer Bonjean repeatedly questioned Susan about whether she truly felt her life was in any danger from Kelly or his associates.
""No one actually threatened you, did they?"" Ms Bonjean asked.
""Yes, they did,"" Susan replied.
Ms Bonjean also asked why the family continued to mix with Kelly in the years after these events. She told the court that the singer was their sole income for a period, paying her musician husband to work on recordings.

Article content “Your entire relationship with (Kelly) centred around stealing from him and lying to him,” lead Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean, raising her voice, told Freeman Wednesday. Minutes later, she added, “You were part of a shakedown scheme, right?” Freeman shot back, “No!” He also said, “I am not a thief.” Federal prosecutors charged Kelly with production of child pornography based in part on that recording, which they say shows him sexually abusing a 14-year-old. He and co-defendant Derrel McDavid are also accused of successfully rigging Kelly’s 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence.

Article content Freeman’s testimony at this trial helps buttress prosecutors’ claims that both Kelly and McDavid knew that videos Kelly had lost track of in the early 2000s were incriminating and could lead to his conviction at the 2008 trial. McDavid’s lawyer, Beau Brindley, started the cross-examination Wednesday by pacing, waving grand jury transcripts at Freeman and several times telling the 52-year-old to “be quiet and listen” to his questions as he sought to tear down Freeman’s credibility. “How many times have you told lies about videotapes connected to Robert Kelly?” Brindley asked, using Kelly’s full first name. “It’s multiple times right?” Freeman agreed it was. Freeman, who is testifying under an immunity agreement, also agreed when Brindley asked if it was difficult “to trust a person who lies who will cheat and steal to get money.”

Brindley also accused Freeman of lying when he testified that he found the video Kelly was looking for in Atlanta in 2001 and when he said he didn’t know its contents until he watched it later the same day. Brindley suggested Freeman never actually went to Atlanta and that he already possessed a potentially compromising video of Kelly, using it to extort Kelly. “That’s how all this happened, isn’t it?” Brindley asked. Freeman said that wasn’t true. Freeman said money wasn’t his only motivation for agreeing to hunt down the video, insisting he also wanted to help his friend, Kelly, whom he had known since around 1990.

Are you having a good time?” Freeman responded, “Yes, I am.” “You aren’t upset with what you’ve done?” Brindley asked. “I am not,” Freeman answered. After acquitting Kelly in 2008, some jurors told reporters they had no choice because the girl — who then was in her 20s — did not take the witness stand to confirm it was her in the video that was at the heart of the state’s case.

Im neuen Prozess gegen R. Kelly hat ein früherer Marketing-Agent schwere Vorwürfe gegen den verurteilten R&B-Sänger erhoben. Der einstige Star habe ihm 2001 eine Million Dollar dafür geboten, eine abhandengekommene Videokassette zu finden, die R. Kelly beim sexuellen Missbrauch einer Minderjährigen zeigen soll, sagte Charles Freeman am Dienstag vor einem Gericht in Chicago aus. Was in der Aufnahme zu sehen war, habe er nicht gewusst, bis er die Kassette damals in einem Haus in Atlanta entdeckt und dann in ein Abspielgerät gesteckt habe.
„Ich habe mir angeschaut, wie Robert Kelly mit einer jungen Frau Sex hatte“, sagte der heute 52-jährige Freeman.
Er schilderte zudem, dass er Kelly und dessen Umfeld dann jahrelang gedrängt habe, ihm die versprochene volle Summe für den Fund und die Rückgabe der Videokassette auszuzahlen. Wiederholt habe er dem Sänger bei dessen Konzerten aufgelauert und ihm angedroht, bei der Polizei auszupacken. Jedes Mal hätten Kellys Helfer ihm daraufhin etwas mehr Geld zugesteckt.
Als ein Staatsanwalt Freeman frage, wieso es fast 20 Jahre gedauert habe, bis er mit seinem Wissen über die Videokassette und anderen Aufnahmen mit Kinderpornografie von Kelly zur Polizei gegangen sei, antwortete er: „Weil die Polizei mir nicht eine Million Dollar gezahlt hätte.“
Kelly wurde bereits in New York von einem Bundesgericht unter anderem wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt. Im neuen Prozess in Chicago geht es zum Teil um das Video, das Freeman für den früheren R&B-Star finden sollte. Laut der Staatsanwaltschaft ist darin eine damals 14-Jährige zu sehen. Die Anklage wirft Kelly vor, das Mädchen damals bestochen und bedroht zu haben, um sie von einer Aussage vor Gericht abzubringen.
In einem Prozess im Jahr 2008 sagte sie am Ende nicht aus, der Sänger wurde freigesprochen. Diesmal kooperierte die heute 37-Jährige aber und belastete Kelly zuletzt vor Gericht massiv. Sie habe als Mädchen über Jahre hinweg Hunderte Male Sex mit dem Grammy-Gewinner gehabt, berichtete sie.
Zwei Mitarbeiter von Kelly sind in Chicago ebenfalls angeklagt. Einer wird beschuldigt, dem Sänger geholfen zu haben, den Prozess 2008 zu beeinflussen, der andere soll Kinderpornografie von Kelly angenommen haben. Beide bestreiten wie auch Kelly alle Vorwürfe.

Witness: Desperate R. Kelly offered $1M for return of video,"Michael Tarm, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - A former merchandizing agent for R. Kelly testified Tuesday that the singer offered him $1 million to find a VHS tape featuring Kelly as prosecutors sought to persuade jurors that Kelly was desperate to recover the missing recording, knowing it could land him in legal peril if it fell into the hands of law enforcement.
Based in part on that recording, which prosecutors say shows the R&B star sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl, Kelly faces charges that include production of child pornography. He is also accused of fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and endeavoring to conceal video evidence.
Charles Freeman testified Tuesday that Kelly reached out to him in 2001 to ask him to hunt down the recording. Freeman, a 52-year-old from Kansas City, also explained how he pressured Kelly and his associates for years to pay him the full $1 million after Freeman found and returned the tape.
Freeman told jurors he didn't know the contents of the video until after he retrieved it from a home in Atlanta in 2001 and then slipped it into a VHS player at a friend's home later that day.
“I observed Robert Kelly with a young lady having sex,” he said.
When a prosecutor asked Freeman, who testified Tuesday under an immunity agreement, why it took him nearly two decades to turn the recording over to police that and other recordings of child phonography tied to Kelly, Freeman responded: “Because the police wasn't going to pay me a million dollars.”
Kelly, 55, is already serving a 30-year prison sentence imposed by a federal judge in New York in June for his 2021 convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. If convicted in Chicago, he could see years added to that sentence.
At his 2008 trial, at which Kelly was ultimately acquitted, state prosecutors described Kelly lugging a duffel bag full of his homemade child pornography tapes everywhere he went. Despite Kelly's efforts in the 1990s to keep them close, some leaked out or were stolen by disgruntled workers or friends, prosecutors said.

R. Kelly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to hide child porn tapes: feds,"R. Kelly and his cronies allegedly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to recover tapes showing the R&B legend having sex with a minor after they went missing, federal prosecutors claimed during his trial.
The bombshell allegation about the huge payments Kelly is said to have made in 2007 was part of an intense day in court Monday — that also included the mother of an alleged victim admitting on the stand that she had lied to a grand jury two decades prior because she feared the singer, the Chicago Tribune reported.

“We were very, very frightened,” said the woman, who testified under the pseudonym “Susan.”
Her daughter, now 37, previously took the stand under the name “Jane,” describing how Kelly allegedly videotaped himself having oral sex with her at his home in Chicago when she was 14 years old.
Susan testified that her daughter appeared in a child porn video with Kelly, who was acquitted of charges stemming from the same footage in a 2008 trial.
The mom said after confronting Kelly about allegedly abusing her underage daughter, he said, “You are with us or against us.”
Her impression was that Kelly and his people “were going to harm us if we didn’t do what they wanted us to do,” she told the court.
Susan said she and her now-deceased husband were depending on Kelly financially at the time.
The Grammy-winning performer’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, tried to get Susan to admit the threats were perceived.
“No one actually threatened you, did they?” Bonjean, who also represented Bill Cosby, asked.
“Yes, they did,” Susan said.

Bonjean further pressed Susan, saying if she lied to the court in the 2000s, she could be lying now.
Susan insisted she was telling the truth, although her testimony did at times contradict her daughter, according to the Tribune.

Based in part on that recording, which prosecutors say shows the R&B star sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl, Kelly faces charges that include production of child pornography. He is also accused of fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and endeavoring to conceal video evidence.
A former merchandizing agent for Kelly, Charles Freeman, testified Tuesday about how Kelly reached out to him in 2001 to ask him to hunt down the recording. Freeman, a 52-year-old from Kansas City, also explained how he pressured Kelly and his associates for years to pay him the full $1 million after Freeman found and returned the tape.

Freeman told jurors he didn’t know the contents of the video until after he retrieved it from a home in Atlanta in 2001 and then slipped it into a VHS player at a friend's home later that day.
“I observed Robert Kelly with a young lady having sex,” he said.
When a prosecutor asked Freeman, who testified Tuesday under an immunity agreement, why it took him nearly two decades to turn over to police that and other recordings of child phonography tied to Kelly, Freeman responded: “Because the police wasn’t going to pay me a million dollars.”
Kelly, 55, is already serving a 30-year prison sentence imposed by a federal judge in New York in June for his 2021 convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. If convicted in Chicago, he could see years added to that sentence.
At his 2008 trial, at which Kelly was ultimately acquitted, state prosecutors described Kelly lugging a duffel bag full of his homemade child pornography tapes everywhere he went. Despite Kelly’s efforts in the 1990s to keep them close, some leaked out or were stolen by disgruntled workers or friends, prosecutors said.

Actually getting the $1 million he said he was promised by Kelly became an all-consuming task that lasted years, Freeman told jurors.
Soon after Freeman found the video, he met with two Kelly associates in 2001 at a Kansas City hotel expecting to receive the full payment. When he walked into a room and saw two brown bags full of cash, he told jurors he knew right away it wasn’t enough.
“That ain’t no million dollars,” he recalled telling Kelly’s people.
He ended up leaving with one paper bag stuffed with $75,000 in cash after being assured he'd eventually get the full $1 million.
He described himself stalking Kelly at concerts to demand he pay the balance of the $1 million, threatening to go public with what he knew and filing a lawsuit to squeeze Kelly to pay. Each threat and lawsuit typically led to Kelly associates throwing more money at Freeman, sometimes literally, he said.
Another time at R. Kelly’s suburban Chicago home, Freeman said a Kelly associate and now co-defendant at the ongoing trial, Derrel McDavid, told Freeman to take off all his clothes and get into Kelly’s swimming pool so he could be sure Freeman wasn’t wearing a recording device for law enforcement.

“I ain’t getting in no pool naked,” Freeman recalled telling McDavid. He eventually did take off his shirt to show he wasn’t wearing a wire.
Later, as he pulled out of a parking lot, McDavid gave Freeman another installment, tossing a brown bag with $100,000 in ten bundles of $10,000 through Freeman’s open car window.
McDavid and another Kelly associate, Milton Brown, are on trial with Kelly. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.
Freeman testified that in late 2003 or early 2004, McDavid approached him again about recovering yet another tape that had gone missing from Kelly's collection. He said he told McDavid, “If I gotta recover another tape, you gotta pay me another million dollars.”
Freeman is expected to take the stand again Wednesday, when defense attorneys will have their chance to cross-examine him.

R. Kelly Accuser’s Mom Testifies She Felt Threatened by Singer,"R. Kelly arrives at the Leighton Courthouse for his status hearing in relation to the sex abuse allegations made against him on May 7, 2019 in Chicago.
CHICAGO (AP) — A mother whose daughter prosecutors say R. Kelly sexually abused starting when she was 14 told jurors Monday (Aug. 22) at the singer’s federal trial that she lied to a state grand jury 20 years ago, in part because she and her husband felt threatened by Kelly and feared for their lives if they told the truth.

The mom, who used the pseudonym “Susan” in court at the trial in Chicago, described how she, her husband and Kelly were crying when the parents confronted the Grammy-winner at a hotel in the early 2000s about whether he was abusing their daughter. She testified they were startled when Kelly told them, “You are with us or against us.”
She said she took those words to mean “that they were going to harm us if we didn’t do what they wanted us to do.” Among the directives from Kelly and an associate was that they had to lie that their daughter was not in a child pornography video and that they had to leave the country immediately for several weeks, she testified.
“We were very, very frightened,” she told jurors.
She added later that she lied to the grand jury “because we feared for our lives and we were intimidated.” She said she also feared for the well-being of her daughter, who warned her parents at the time that she might commit suicide if they refused to do what Kelly asked them to do.
Kelly, 55, is on trial in his hometown on charges that include production of child pornography, enticing minor girls for sex and obstruction justice by successfully rigging his 2008 child pornography trial in state court, at which he was acquitted.
Kelly is already staring at a 30-year prison sentence imposed by a federal judge in New York in June for his 2021 convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges.
Susan’s daughter, who went by the pseudonym “Jane,” was among the prosecution’s first witnesses as the trial began last week. Jane told jurors that she also lied to the same grand jury prior to 2008 trial when she said she was not the 14-year-old girl in a video with Kelly. Jane, now 37, told jurors last week that, in fact, she had been sexually abused hundreds of times by Kelly before she had turned at 18.
On Monday, in an often contentious cross-examination, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean repeatedly questioned Susan about whether she truly felt her life was in any danger from Kelly or his associates.
“No one actually threatened you, did they?” Bonjean asked.
“Yes, they did,” Susan answered.
Bonjean also asked why, if Susan felt so threatened by Kelly, she and her family continued to mix with Kelly socially for the next 20 years. She answered that Kelly was their sole income for a period, paying her musician husband to work on Kelly recordings. She also said she worried about Jane’s welfare if they cut ties with Kelly.
The husband, Jane’s father, died last year, she told jurors.
During her cross, Bonjean highlighted Susan’s testimony that she lied to the Illinois grand jury, asking if she was “telling the truth now.” Susan said she was.
Prosecutors from the Cook County state’s attorney’s office chose in the mid-2000s to push ahead with charges and to take the case to trial in 2008 despite what they knew was a major hurdle: their inability to call the girl in the video to testify.
After acquitting Kelly in the 2008 trial, some jurors told reporters that that they had no choice but to find Kelly not guilty because the girl — who by then was in her 20s — did not take the witness stand to confirm it was, in fact, her in the video.
Federal prosecutors at the current trial played excerpts of that and other videos they say show Kelly when he was around 30 sexually abusing a 14-year-old Jane.
Kelly has been trailed for decades by allegations about his sexual behavior. The scrutiny intensified during the #MeToo era and following the 2019 release of the Lifetime television docuseries Surviving R. Kelly.",2022-08-23T16:21:17Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"R. Kelly Accuser's Mother Testifies That He Threatened Her Family: ""They Were Going To Harm Us""","While R.Kelly is currently facing a 30-year sentence on charges of on racketeering and sex trafficking, the convicted singer is still on trial in his hometown of Chicago on charges that include production of child pornography, enticing minor girls for sex and more. Just days after Sparkle spoke out to defend herself against claims that she encouraged her 14-year old niece to interact with Kelly 20 years ago, more details were revealed about the troubled singer's interaction with the unnamed accuser and her family.
During Monday's court hearing, the accuser's mother (who used the pseudonym, “Susan"" in court) took the stand to share that she and her husband lied to during Kelly's 2002 trial because they feared for their lives. Susan described how she, her husband and R. Kelly were crying when the they confronted the singer at a hotel in the early 2000s about whether he was abusing their daughter. She claims the Grammy Award winner told the parents, ""You are with us or against us.”
She told jurors that she took Kelly's word's to mean ""they were going to harm us if we didn’t do what they wanted us to do,"" adding, ""We were very, very frightened. Because we feared for our lives and we were intimidated."" Her now adult daughter, who's court pseudonym is “Jane"" also dropped a bombshell during the trial, revealing that she also lied to the grand jury prior when she said she was not the 14-year-old girl in a video with Kelly. Jane also shocked the world when she confirmed that the singer had sex with her ""hundreds"" of times before her 18th birthday.
R. Kelly also faces a charge of obstruction of justice for allegedly rigging his 2008 trial on state child pornography charges stemming from the video of him and Jane having sex when she was underage.",2022-08-23T15:16:26Z,https://www.hotnewhiphop.com,HotNewHipHop
"In Court, She’s Always Judging You","“She wore a black-and-white power suit, double-breasted and very graphic, with big lapels outlined in white. You could say she was making a statement.”
Elizabeth Williams could have been describing an uptown matron smartly turned out for lunch at Sant Ambroeus. But the subject was Gloria Allred, the women’s rights lawyer, whose image she captured in June as Ms. Allred stood in a federal courtroom in Manhattan awaiting sentencing of the singer R. Kelly for racketeering and sex trafficking.
Ms. Williams is a courtroom artist with a canny eye for style. A former fashion illustrator, she is tasked with rendering charged portraits of accused killers, mob chieftains, white collar criminals, sex offenders and, as often, their alleged victims, with a measure of fidelity and journalistic flair.",2022-08-23T09:00:19Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times

Witness: Desperate R. Kelly offered $1M for return of video,"CHICAGO (AP) — A former merchandizing agent for R. Kelly testified Tuesday that the singer offered him $1 million to find a VHS tape featuring Kelly as prosecutors sought persuade jurors that Kelly was desperate to recover the missing recording, knowing it could land him in legal peril if it fell into the hands of law enforcement.

On Monday, in an often contentious cross-examination, Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean repeatedly questioned Susan about whether she truly felt her life was in any danger from Kelly or his associates.
“No one actually threatened you, did they?” Bonjean asked.
“Yes, they did,” Susan answered.
After R&B star R. Kelly was found guilty of nine federal counts of racketeering and sex trafficking, attorney Gloria Allred, who represented several of Kelly’s victims, spoke out about the heinous nature of his crimes, including knowingly spreading genital herpes and using child pornography to blackmail his victims into compliance.
Bonjean also asked why, if Susan felt so threatened by Kelly, she and her family continued to mix with Kelly socially for the next 20 years. She answered that Kelly was their sole income for a period, paying her musician husband to work on Kelly recordings. She also said she worried about Jane’s welfare if they cut ties with Kelly.
The husband, Jane’s father, died last year, she told jurors.
During her cross, Bonjean highlighted Susan’s testimony that she lied to the Illinois grand jury, asking if she was “telling the truth now.” Susan said she was.
Prosecutors from the Cook County state’s attorney’s office chose in the mid-2000s to push ahead with charges and to take the case to trial in 2008 despite what they knew was a major hurdle: their inability to call the girl in the video to testify.
After acquitting Kelly in the 2008 trial, some jurors told reporters that they had no choice but to find Kelly not guilty because the girl — who by then was in her 20s — did not take the witness stand to confirm it was, in fact, her in the video.
Federal prosecutors at the current trial played excerpts of that and other videos they say show Kelly when he was around 30 sexually abusing a 14-year-old Jane.

The second week of R. Kelly’s federal child-pornography trial is slated to begin Monday with further testimony from prosecution witnesses.
Jurors on Friday saw key pieces of evidence: graphic clips of three separate videos allegedly showing the R&B superstar sexually assaulting his 14-year-old goddaughter in the late 1990s. They also heard last week from a woman testifying under the pseudonym “Jane,” who said she was the girl on the videos and Kelly had sex with her “innumerable times” when she was underage.

The trial is expected to last at least through mid-September, and jurors are likely to hear from more women who say Kelly had sexual contact with them when they were minors. Prosecutors also allege Kelly and his team took extensive measures to conceal Kelly’s misdeeds, ultimately leading to his acquittal on state child-pornography charges in 2008.
Kelly’s defense so far has not directly contested that it is Kelly on the video clips, only saying that their authenticity could not be verified and that Kelly was previously acquitted for conduct related to them. Nor has the defense given jurors an alternate version of Jane’s narrative of events related to videos. Instead, the defense lawyers are seeking to sow doubt by telling the panel Jane denied it was her on the clips for more than two decades.

The videos are at the heart of the case against Kelly and his two co-defendants, who are accused of conspiring to pay off victims and witnesses and cover up years of alleged sexual abuse of minors by Kelly.
Kelly, 55, is charged with 13 counts of production of child pornography, conspiracy to produce child pornography and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Some of the counts carry a mandatory minimum of 10 years behind bars if convicted, while others have ranges of five to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors are also seeking a personal money forfeiture of $1.5 million from Kelly.
Also on trial are Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.
Regardless of the outcome, Kelly is still facing decades in prison. In June, he was sentenced to 30 years on federal racketeering charges brought in New York. He is appealing both the jury’s verdict and the sentence in that case.

Accuser’s mom: R Kelly’s threats made her fear for her life,"CHICAGO (AP) — A mother whose daughter prosecutors say R. Kelly sexually abused starting when she was 14, told jurors Monday at the singer’s federal trial that she lied to a state grand jury 20 years ago, in part because she and her husband felt threatened by Kelly and feared for their lives if they told the truth.
The mom, who used the pseudonym, “Susan,” in court at the trial in Chicago, described how she, her husband and Kelly were crying when the parents confronted the Grammy-winner at a hotel in the early 2000s about whether he was abusing their daughter. She testified they were startled when Kelly told them, “You are with us or against us.”
She said she took those words to mean “that they were going to harm us if we didn’t do what they wanted us to do.” Among the directives from Kelly and an associate was that they had to lie that their daughter was not in a child pornography video and that they had to leave the country immediately for several weeks, she testified.
“We were very, very frightened,” she told jurors.
She added later that she lied to the grand jury “because we feared for our lives and we were intimidated.” She said she also feared for the well-being of her daughter, who warned her parents at the time that she might commit suicide if they refused to do what Kelly asked them to do.
Kelly, 55, is on trial in his hometown on charges that include production of child pornography, enticing minor girls for sex and obstruction justice by successfully rigging his 2008 child pornography trial in state court, at which he was acquitted.
Kelly is already staring at a 30-year prison sentence imposed by a federal judge in New York in June for his 2021 convictions on racketeering and sex trafficking charges.
Susan’s daughter, who went by the pseudonym “Jane,” was among the prosecution’s first witnesses as the trial began last week. Jane told jurors that she also lied to the same grand jury prior to 2008 trial when she said she was not the 14-year-old girl in a video with Kelly. Jane, now 37, told jurors last week that, in fact, she had been sexually abused hundreds of times by Kelly before she had turned at 18.

Joycelyn Savage Claims She and Singer Did IVF to Start Family Amid His Lawyer's Denial of Pregnancy,"As R. Kelly faces his second criminal trial this year, his longtime girlfriend turned fiancee Joycelyn Savage came forward and revealed that she is pregnant with his child. Kelly’s lawyers refute the claims, stating that it’s impossible for her to be pregnant by Kelly as he’s been in prison since 2020. Now, Savage is doubling down on the pregnancy claims, explaining the lawyer had no idea about their fertility journey.
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS – FEBRUARY 23: Joycelyn Savage (R) and Azriel Clary arrive for a bond hearing for R&B singer R. Kelly at the Leighton Criminal Court Building on February 23, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois. Kelly, who is facing charges on ten counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, is being held on $1 million bond. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)
R. Kelly’s lawyer shoots down Joycelyn Savage’s claim that she’s expecting singer’s baby
Savage is releasing a book about her relationship with the jailed singer. The book, titled Love and Joy of Robert, featured a sonogram that she said Kelly approved for publication. She said in the announcement that she and Kelly are thrilled to be parents. She’s been with Kelly since she was 19 years old.

Her parents allege that she’s being controlled and manipulated by the singer, and is part of a sex cult. Savage insists she’s with Kelly on her own merit, and that her parents are seeking to exploit him. Some of their relationship was detailed in the Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly.
But Kelly’s lawyer Jennifer Bonjean says Savage’s claims are untrue. “There is no truth to reports that Joy is releasing a tell-all memoir and she is certainly not pregnant with R. Kelly’s child. People are just insane. Carry on,” she wrote in a Tweet.
Joycelyn Savage says R. Kelly’s laywer was unaware she did IVF
Despite Bonjean’s statement, Savage insists she’s carrying the disgraced R&B singer’s baby. “I’m very excited,” she said in a recent interview, as reported by The Jasmine Brand. She adds that the IVF treatments were kept relatively secret. “His lawyer didn’t know that prior to him going to jail. Robert and I were doing IVF because at the time I was told I couldn’t have a baby. When he got sent to prison, we paused on it and I had them freeze my eggs until I was ready.”
Source: YouTube
Now that she is pregnant, she says Kelly’s lawyer requested that she consider terminating the child. The news came amid Kelly’s first Brooklyn criminal case.
“Once his lawyer did find out, she wanted me to have an abortion because she didn’t feel that now was the time for me to have a child following the 30-year sentence,” Savage claims. “Me and Robert wanted to have a child for a long time. He is very happy about it, his lawyer isn’t. Once I told her I was keeping my baby, she didn’t want me to announce but I wanted to share the news. I’ve always been there for him even before this new lawyer came into the picture.”
The singer is currently in his second criminal trial for sex abuse this year
Kelly hasn’t personally released any statement regarding whether or not he’ll be a father again. He’s seemingly too embroiled in his own legal drama. His second criminal trial this year began in Aug. 2022 in Illinois. He’s facing additional sex abuse charges, with sex tapes allegedly featuring underage girls being shown to jurors as evidence. Kelly maintains his innocence.

"YK Osiris Says Usher Is King Of R&B, Not R. Kelly","YK Osiris had a lot of things he wanted to get off his chest in a recent VladTV appearance. The singer discussed his beef with Tory Lanez, which stemmed from Lanez reportedly laughing at his song ""Be My Girl."" ""I just felt like, if you gon' laugh, just make sure you post my stuff, too,"" Osiris told Vlad.
The Florida musician also had some takes on who deserves the title of the king of R&B. According to Osiris, Usher has the crown. The ""Worth It"" singer noted that R. Kelly is a big figure in the genre, but his actions outside of music have disqualified him.
First, Osiris denied that he had labelled himself the king of R&B, though he did release an EP in 2021 titled King of R&B. According to YK, Def Jam had chosen the title to cause a stir. Osiris then segued into who he thought was in fact the king.
""I love Usher,"" he said. ""R. Kelly, he’s one of the greatest. I like Usher. It’s just certain things like R. Kelly is fire, but there’s just certain things that turns me off a little bit. Like you can be great all you want to, it just certain things you gotta uphold. It’s cool; I just love Usher. Usher is that n***a. R. Kelly, I don’t know, did a lot of things that just doesn’t make sense.""
The things YK Osiris says that just don't make sense may be the things that resulted in the nine federal charges R. Kelly was found guilty of in 2021, including sex crimes and human trafficking. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison back in June.

"Une femme accuse R. Kelly d’avoir abusé d’elle "" des centaines de fois "" alors qu’elle était mineure.","Pool / Getty Images Pool / Getty Images
ÉTATS-UNIS - La star déchue du R&B, R. Kelly, déjà condamnée à 30 ans de prison en juin pour crimes sexuels, comparaissait de nouveau cette semaine pour des charges similaires dans un tribunal de sa ville natale de Chicago.
Il est accusé d’obstruction à la justice, de production de pédopornographie et d’activité sexuelle illégale avec une personne mineure.
Lors d’une audience jeudi 18 août, la femme qui est au centre des problèmes juridiques du chanteur depuis plus de deux décennies a livré un témoignage marquant. Selon elle, R. Kelly l’a agressée sexuellement « des centaines de fois » alors qu’elle était encore mineure.
Jane - le pseudonyme de cette femme maintenant âgée de 37 ans - a également déclaré qu’elle était la fille présente sur la vidéo avec R. Kelly, qui était au cœur de son procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, et dont il a été acquitté.
Lorsque le procureur lui a demandé quel âge elle avait à l’époque de cette vidéo, Jane a répondu « 14 ans ». R. Kelly, âgé aujourd’hui de 55 ans, avait lui environ 30 ans à l’époque. Lorsqu’on lui a demandé pourquoi elle continuait à avoir des relations sexuelles avec la star, Jane a dit qu’elle le considérait alors comme une figure d’autorité et ne savait pas comment lui dire « non ».
Elle devait recruter d’autres filles mineures
Elle a également admis que R. Kelly lui avait demandé de recruter d’autres filles mineures pour avoir des relations sexuelles avec lui.
Selon TMZ, Jane n’avait pas pris la parole lors du procès pour pornographie juvénile de 2008, et elle et sa famille avaient nié sa relation avec R. Kelly pendant des années.
Fin juin, le chanteur avait été reconnu coupable à New York d’avoir piloté pendant plusieurs décennies un « système » d’exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes, et condamné à 30 ans derrière les barreaux.
Cette condamnation, la première dans un procès où la majorité des parties civiles étaient des femmes noires, a été vue comme un tournant du mouvement #MeToo.
Les débats avaient permis de mettre au jour le « système » de R. Kelly pour attirer de très jeunes femmes et les violer, avec la complicité de son entourage. Nombre de victimes avaient raconté leur rencontre avec leur idole lors de concerts après lesquels on leur glissait un petit papier avec les coordonnées du chanteur.
Il est également poursuivi dans deux autres États.

Reports stated that the niece alleged Sparkle suggested: ""That I should rub his head and ask him to take that role in my life."" Kelly allegedly agreed to be her godfather, something that the woman claimed her parents approved of.

Witness about R. Kelly: I didn't want to ''carry his lies'',"A woman who says she was sexually abused hundreds of times by R. Kelly as a minor has testified that she agonised several years ago about whether to cooperate with federal investigators who were looking into child abuse allegations involving the singer, but she ultimately did because she didn't want to “carry his lies”.
Hours before jurors got their first glimpse of sexually explicit videos at the heart of the prosecution's bid to prove Kelly produced child pornography and successfully rigged his 2008 child porn trial, the woman, who is now 37 and going by the pseudonym “Jane” during the current trial, on Friday conceded that even after she began cooperating, she lied when she told agents she wasn't sure if Kelly had abused minors other than her.
She said she lied because she didn't want to get others in trouble.
Jane testified for over four hours on Thursday, saying it was she and Kelly in a videotape that was the focus of the 2008 trial, at which he was acquitted.
She also said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times from the late 1990s before she turned 18. Kelly, 55, was around 30 years old at the time.
While cross-examining her on Friday, Kelly's lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, sought to cast the R and B singer in a more favourable light after Jane testified the day before about how Kelly pursued her sexually starting when she was around 14 years old.
Kelly has been trailed for decades by allegations about his sexual behaviour. The scrutiny intensified during the #MeToo era and following the 2019 release of the Lifetime television docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly”.
Under questioning, Jane said her relationship with Kelly lasted 12 years and continued for two years after his 2008 trial, until she was 26.
Bonjean asked if, “after you broke up, you cared about him and he cared about you?” Jane said that was true.
As “Surviving R. Kelly” was coming out, Jane said she was concerned for Kelly and reached out to him. In one text to him, she wrote, “I love you. Don't let the devil win.” She said she repeatedly tried to contact him in 2019 for advice as she pondered whether to speak to authorities at length about Kelly for the first time. She told jurors: “I felt comfortable enough to reach out to him because I was afraid.” She decided shortly thereafter to speak to investigators.
“I no longer wanted to carry his lies,” she said.
Kelly, who denies any wrongdoing, was given a 30-year prison sentence by a federal judge in New York earlier this year for a 2021 conviction for using his fame to sexually abuse fans. For the duration of the current trial, he is being held in a federal jail in Chicago, his hometown.
Prosecutors say Kelly intimidated and paid off the girl — Jane — to ensure she didn't testify at the 2008 trial to identify herself and Kelly in the critical video, which the government says Kelly made in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 2000.
Jane testified on Thursday that she was the girl, then 14, in the video and that Kelly was the man in it.
It was one of three videos that prosecutors played excerpts of on Friday that they said showed Kelly sexually abusing an underage Jane. Before the videos were played on monitors in front of each juror's chair, court officials set up high opaque screens around the jury that blocked journalists and spectators from seeing the videos and jurors' reactions to them.
The sound was audible throughout the courtroom, though, and in one video the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks, “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man is also heard giving her sexually explicit instructions.
Earlier, prosecutors suggested that any viewing of the videos by the public could run afoul of child pornography laws, and they asked Judge Harry Leinenweber to send reporters and spectators out of the courtroom while jurors watched them. The judge rejected the request.
After the acquittal in the 2008 trial, some jurors said afterward that they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because the girl — by then an adult — didn't testify.
On the stand on Thursday, Jane conceded that she lied to a grand jury in 2002 when she said it wasn't her in the video.
Jane has testified that she met Kelly through an aunt who worked with him, and that she asked Kelly to be her godfather when she was 13. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it, and so prosecutors say he conspired to fix that trial.

Jane testified for more than four hours on Thursday, saying it was she and Kelly in a videotape that was the focus of the 2008 trial, at which he was acquitted.
She also said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times from the late 1990s before she turned 18. Kelly, 55, was around 30 years old at the time.
Cross-examining her on Friday, Kelly’s lead attorney Jennifer Bonjean sought to cast the R&B singer in a more favourable light after Jane testified the day before about how Kelly pursued her sexually starting when she was about 14 years old.
Kelly has been trailed for decades by allegations about his sexual behaviour. The scrutiny intensified during the #MeToo era and following the 2019 release of the television docuseries Surviving R. Kelly.
Jane said her relationship with Kelly lasted 12 years and continued for two years after his 2008 trial, until she was 26.
Bonjean asked whether, “after you broke up, you cared about him and he cared about you?”. Jane said that was true.
As Surviving R. Kelly was coming out, Jane said she was concerned for Kelly and reached out to him. In one text she wrote, “I love you. Don’t let the devil win”.
She said she repeatedly tried to contact him in 2019 for advice as she pondered whether to speak to authorities at length about Kelly for the first time.
I no longer wanted to carry his lies.
She decided shortly thereafter to speak to investigators.
“I no longer wanted to carry his lies,” she said.
Kelly, who denies any wrongdoing, was given a 30-year prison sentence by a federal judge in New York earlier this year for a 2021 conviction for using his fame to sexually abuse fans.
Prosecutors say Kelly intimidated and paid off Jane to ensure she did not testify at the 2008 trial to identify herself and Kelly in the critical video, which the government says Kelly made in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 2000.
Jane testified on Thursday that she was the girl, then 14, in the video and that Kelly was the man in it.
It was one of three videos that prosecutors played excerpts of on Friday that they said showed Kelly sexually abusing an underage Jane.

Although screens were shielded, the sound was audible throughout the courtroom, and in one video the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy”. The man is also heard giving her sexually explicit instructions.
After the acquittal in the 2008 trial, some jurors said they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because the girl - by then an adult - did not testify.
On the stand on Thursday, Jane conceded she lied to a grand jury in 2002 when she said it was not her in the video.
Jane has testified she met Kelly through an aunt who worked with him, and that she asked Kelly to be her godfather when she was 13.
She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it, and so prosecutors say he conspired to fix that trial.",2022-08-19T23:55:44Z,https://www.perthnow.com.au,PerthNow
R. Kelly Witness Says She Didn’t Want to ‘Carry His Lies’,"A woman who says she was sexually abused hundreds of times by R. Kelly before she turned 18 testified Friday (Aug. 19) that she agonized several years ago about whether to cooperate with federal investigators who were looking into child abuse allegations involving the singer, but that she ultimately did because she didn’t want to “carry his lies.”

Kelly, who denies any wrongdoing, is serving a 30-year prison sentence following his conviction in a New York federal court last year for using his fame to sexually abuse fans.
At his current trial in his hometown of Chicago, he faces charges of child pornography and conspiring to rig his 2008 trial by intimidating and paying off the girl — Jane — to ensure she didn’t testify.

She said she did so because she was afraid “something bad would happen” to Kelly and because she was ashamed.
Jane said she grew up in a musical family in a Chicago suburb and was home-schooled because she was in a touring musical group that she joined when she was about 12. She said she met Kelly through an aunt who worked with him, and that she asked him to be her godfather when she was 13 because she viewed him as an inspiration and a mentor. She said within weeks, Kelly would call her and say sexual things. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse.
She described her parents confronting Kelly in the early 2000s about whether he was having sex with their daughter. Kelly dropped to his knees and begged her parents to forgive him, Jane testified. She said she later implored her parents not to do anything to get Kelly in trouble, telling them she loved him.

Segundo o site TMZ, ela se apresentou na última quinta (18) no julgamento federal do artista, em Chicago.
Ela afirmou que tinha apenas 15 anos quando começou a ter relações sexuais com o então padrinho. Jane disse que não conseguia dizer não por se sentir intimada demais. Ela teria pedido para Kelly ser seu padrinho em 1990, quando tinha apenas 13 anos.
Segundo a suposta vítima, a primeira interação sexual entre os dois foi quando ela tinha cerca de 14 anos, e o cantor tocou seu seio dentro de um estúdio de gravação em Chicago. Jane afirmou que as relações sexuais aconteciam na casa do artista, no estúdio de gravação, ônibus de turnê e até mesmo em quartos de hotel.
Jane contou que ele também fazia sexo com outras adolescentes que a mandava recrutar.

Im neuerlichen Prozess gegen den verurteilten amerikanischen Popsänger R. Kelly hat die Staatsanwaltschaft am Donnerstag ihre wichtigste Zeugin aufgerufen: eine heute 37 Jahre alte Frau, die als Minderjährige von Kelly missbraucht worden sein soll. Die Zeugin, in dem Verfahren nur als „Jane“ bezeichnet, war laut der Anklage auf einem Sex-Video zu sehen, das der Sänger vor mehr als 20 Jahren mit ihr aufnahm. Die Bilder lösten damals die ersten Ermittlungen gegen Kelly aus.
Jane sagte aus, sie habe Hunderte Male mit Kelly Sex gehabt, bevor sie 18 gewesen sei. Den ersten Geschlechtsverkehr mit ihm habe sie im Alter von 15 Jahren gehabt. Jane lernte Kelly in den späten 90er Jahren kennen, als sie noch zu Schule ging. Sie hatte mit ihrer Tante, einer professionellen Sängerin, die mit Kelly zusammenarbeitete, dessen Aufnahmestudio in Chicago besucht und dort den Musiker getroffen. Sie habe ihn als Inspiration und als Mentor betrachtet, sagte sie aus.
Der Grammy-Gewinner muss sich in Chicago wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs von Minderjährigen, der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie und Verschwörung zur Behinderung der Justiz verantworten. Im letzten Punkt geht es um einen Prozess im Jahr 2008, in dessen Mittelpunkt die mutmaßlichen Aufnahmen mit Jane standen. Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft Kelly vor, Jane bestochen und bedroht zu haben, um sie von einer Aussage vor Gericht abzubringen. Jane sagte tatsächlich nicht aus und der Sänger wurde freigesprochen. Im Gegensatz zu 2008 kooperierte Jane dieses Mal mit der Anklage und ist nun eine wichtige Zeugin.
Die Staatsanwaltschaft erklärte, Kelly habe das Video von Jane zwischen 1998 und 2000 in seinem Haus angefertigt, als sie erst 13 Jahre alt gewesen sei. Darin ist zu hören, wie das Mädchen den Mann „Daddy“ nennt. Das Mädchen und Kelly hatten nach Angaben der Anklage über die Jahre hinweg Hunderte Male Sex in seinen Häusern, Aufnahmestudios und Tourbussen.

Kelly wird außerdem der Verführung Minderjähriger in vier Fällen beschuldigt. Es wurde erwartet, dass die vier mutmaßlichen Opfer ebenfalls aussagen würden. Darüber hinaus kündigte die Staatsanwaltschaft an, Videoaufnahmen der mutmaßlichen Taten vorzulegen.
Der Sänger wurde bereits in New York von einem Bundesrichter wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt. Vorwürfe bezüglich seines Sexualverhaltens begleiteten Kelly über Jahre. Nach Beginn der #MeToo-Bewegung und der Veröffentlichung des Dokumentarfilms „Surviving R. Kelly“ von 2019 verschärften sich die Forderungen nach einer strafrechtlichen Verfolgung des Stars.
Zwei Mitarbeiter von Kelly sind in Chicago ebenfalls angeklagt. Einer wird beschuldigt, dem Sänger geholfen zu haben, den Prozess 2008 zu beeinflussen, der andere soll Kinderpornografie von Kelly angenommen haben. Beide bestreiten wie auch Kelly alle Vorwürfe.

Prosecutors Hit Back After R. Kelly's Lawyer Tries To Block $27K Inmate Account Seizure,"R. Kelly's back in court in Chicago for his federal trial relating to his infamous 2008 dismissal but prosecutors are adamantly trying to prevent the cash from flowing in. Per Radar Online, the prosecutors have fired back at his lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, who accused them of improperly seizing $27K from the singer's inmate bank account.

Last week, prosecutors told the court that Kelly accumulated $30K in his inmate bank account within the past three years. They said they wanted to seize $27K out of the singer's account -- leaving him with less than $1,000 -- since Kelly hasn't paid a dime out of the fines handed down to him from his previous conviction. They said Kelly still owes $140,900 in its entirety.
Bonjean responded to the court, accusing the prosecutors of improperly seizing Kelly's money without going through the required steps to do so.
""This Court should order the immediate return of Mr. Kelly’s funds and further sanction the office of the United States Attorney and the Bureau of Prison for seizing funds without lawful authority,"" Bonjean said.
However, the prosecutors explained that Bonjean's arguments ""are entirely unavailing and factually inaccurate."" They explained that nothing's been seized but Kelly's accounts have been frozen until the judge makes a decision. Furthermore, they brushed off the notion that Kelly needed to be notified ahead of time.
In related news, Kelly's former goddaughter, and the alleged victim in the infamous sex tape, took the stand against him on Thursday. She testified that Kelly began having sex with her when she was 15 years old.

R. Kelly wieder vor Gericht: Unter Tränen sagte jetzt sein Patenkind aus,"Dem bereits verurteilten R. Kelly wird wieder der Prozess gemacht
Von: Alexander Friedrich
Auch am Boden kann er noch tiefer fallen.
Im Juni wurde Popstar R. Kelly (55, bürgerlich: Robert Sylvester Kelly) wegen sexuellen Missbrauchs zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt. Schließen wird sich seine Schand-Akte deshalb noch lange nicht. Der Sexualstraftäter steckt mitten im nächsten Prozess.
Die Vorwürfe sind an Grausamkeit kaum zu überbieten: Kellys eigene frühere Patentochter sagte am Donnerstag (vierter Prozesstag) vor dem Gericht in Chicago aus, der Sänger hätte sie in ihrer Kindheit missbraucht. Hunderte Male, wie unter anderem „Entertainment Tonight“ von der Verhandlung berichtet.
Im Juni wurde R. Kelly in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt
14 Jahre alt soll „Jane“ – so das Pseudonym, mit dem die heute 37-Jährige auftritt – damals gewesen sein. Schrecklich: R. Kelly habe seine widerlichen Vergehen in seinem Haus in Chicago sogar gefilmt. Darunter ein schon länger bekanntes Video, in dem er ein Mädchen missbraucht und anschließend auf ihm uriniert. Dabei soll es sich um seine Patentochter handeln.
Zum ersten Mal habe Kelly sie Ende der 1990er-Jahre in seinem Aufnahmestudio angefasst, bei ihm Zuhause sei es dann auch zum Geschlechtsverkehr gekommen. Immer wieder sei er „in sie eingedrungen“ – bis „Jane“ 18 Jahre alt wurde, wie sie schildert.
Auf den Videoaufnahmen soll außerdem zu sehen sein, wie Kelly ihr Geld gibt. Eine Vorsichtsmaßnahme, wie „Jane“ vor Gericht sagt. „Wenn jemand das Band sehen sollte, wollte er es so aussehen lassen, als wäre ich eine Prostituierte“, erzählt das mutmaßliche Opfer des Grammy-Gewinners unter Tränen.
Auch als Schweigegeld sollen die Scheine gedient haben. Laut Staatsanwaltschaft soll Kelly „Jane“ und ihren Eltern Geld gezahlt haben, damit sie nicht aussagen. Der Sänger riet der Familie sogar, Chicago zu verlassen und bezahlte sie, damit sie nach Mexiko und auf die Bahamas reisen konnten.
R. Kelly vor wenigen Tagen bei einer Anhörung in Chicago, seit Donnerstag läuft sein nächster Missbrauchsprozess
Als sie dem nachgingen und schließlich zurückkehrten, soll R. Kelly seine Patentochter immer mehr von ihren Eltern isoliert haben. Ständig reisten sie in verschiedene Hotels. Als „Janes“ Eltern den Musiker schließlich mit einem seiner Sex-Videos konfrontierten, soll der ihnen gedroht haben: „Entweder seid ihr für oder gegen mich.“
Warum Kellys Patenkind nicht schon früher aussagte? Seit Jahrzehnten wird schon gegen den Popstar ermittelt, 2008 wurde er noch in einem Missbrauchsprozess freigesprochen.
Die damals junge Erwachsene „Jane“ hätte damals vernichtende Beweise liefern können, jedoch „Angst gehabt, dass Robert etwas Schlimmes passieren würde“, wie sie nun erzählt. „Ich hatte ihn beschützt.“
War ihr überhaupt bewusst, was der Straftäter ihr antat? Wie sehr manipulierte Robert Kelly sein Patenkind? Tatsächlich soll „Jane“ den Star-Sänger geliebt haben, wie sie sagt. Daher flehte sie auch ihre Eltern an, nicht an die Öffentlichkeit zu gehen, als diese von den Taten Kellys erfuhren.
Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft Robert Kelly nun vor, „Jane“ und ihre Familie unter Druck gesetzt zu haben. Das vorliegende Video soll als wichtiges Beweismaterial dienen, ebenso wie „Janes“ Aussagen.
Die Anwältinnen Jennifer Bonjean (l.) und Ashley Cohen vertreten Kelly vor dem Gericht
12 Geschworene sollen wieder über die Schuld des Popstars („I Believe I Can Fly“) richten. Insgesamt 13 Anklagepunkte stehen zur Debatte: unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen, der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen und der Behinderung der Justiz.
Auch wenn R. Kelly wohl den Rest seines Lebens hinter Gittern verbringt, ist es sehr wahrscheinlich, dass nun weitere Jahrzehnte zu seiner Haftstrafe hinzukommen.",2022-08-19T14:27:21Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD
R. Kelly: Η βαφτιστήρα του καταγγέλλει πως αναγκαζόταν να έχει ερωτική σχέση μαζί του μέχρι τα 18 της,"Πληροφορίες που προκαλούν φρίκη έρχονται στο φως, ενώ εξελίσσεται η δίκη του R. Kelly. Ο τραγουδιστής κατηγορείται για παιδική πορνογραφία, με την βαφτιστήρα του να φέρνει στο φως ακόμα μια βίαιη πράξη του.
Κατά τη διάρκεια της τέταρτης ημέρας της δίκης του, η 37χρονη σήμερα βαφτιστήρα του R. Kelly κατέθεσε εναντίον του, ισχυριζόμενη πως συνευρέθηκε σεξουαλικά μαζί του «εκατοντάδες φορές», ενώ ήταν ακόμα ανήλικη.
ΔΙΑΦΗΜΙΣΗ
Η Τζέιν κατήγγειλε πως ήταν μόνο 14 ετών, όταν ο R. Kelly την ανάγκαζε σε ερωτικές περιπτύξεις μαζί του, ενώ δήλωσε πως είχε στην κατοχή του ένα ερωτικό βίντεο με την ίδια.
Προκειμένου μάλιστα, να μην διακινδυνεύσει το όνομά του σε περίπτωση που χανόταν η κασέτα, o R.Kelly της είχε δώσει χρήματα και το είχε καταγράψει, για να μπορεί αργότερα να ισχυριστεί ότι ήταν ιερόδουλη που γνώρισε τυχαία.

R. Kelly’s ex-goddaughter claims he had sex with her ‘hundreds of times’ as a minor https://t.co/yCWdp3p2jh — OlumoRocktv (@OlumoRocktv) August 19, 2022
«Σε περίπτωση που κάποιος έβλεπε την κασέτα ή αν κυκλοφορούσε για τον οποιοδήποτε λόγο, θα έλεγε ότι είμαι πόρνη», δήλωσε ενώπιον του Δικαστηρίου η Τζέιν. Μάλιστα, τόνισε πως κάθε ερωτική σχέση μεταξύ τους τελείωσε, μόλις εκείνη έκλεισε τα 18.
Όπως ανέφερε στην κατάθεσή της, ο 30χρονος τότε τραγουδιστής την άγγιξε για πρώτη φορά σε ένα στούντιο ηχογράφησης στο Σικάγο, ενώ στη συνέχεια την καλούσε συχνά στο σπίτι του στο North Side.

R. Kelly’s legal team to question key witness today at trial in Chicago,"R. Kelly’s legal team will get its chance to question the government’s star witness on Friday after she gave what jurors could see as damning testimony against Kelly at his federal trial in Chicago on charges that include the production of child pornography.
Jane, the pseudonym used for her during the trial, has been central to Kelly’s legal troubles for more than two decades. She testified for over four hours for the government Thursday, telling jurors it was her and Kelly in a videotape that was at the heart of his 2008 child pornography trial, at which he was acquitted.
Jane, now 37, paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue as she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her and that the man was Kelly.
When a prosecutor asked Jane how old she was at the time the video was shot, she said quietly: “14.” Kelly, 55, would have been around 30 years old at the time.
In addition to charges of child pornography and enticement of minors, Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, faces charges of conspiring to rig that 2008 trial by intimidating and paying off the girl to ensure she didn’t testify then.
Some jurors for the 2008 trial, which was on state charges, said that they had no choice but to acquit the R&B star because the girl – by then an adult – didn’t testify. On the stand Thursday, Jane conceded that she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said that it was not her in the video.
“I was afraid something bad would happen to Robert,” she told jurors about why she didn’t tell the truth then, referring to Kelly by his full first name. “I was protecting him.”
She added there was another reason she lied about the identity of the person in the video. “I also did not want that person to be me,” she told jurors. “I was ashamed.”
Kelly’s attorney was scheduled to get her chance to cross-examine Jane starting Friday morning.
A prosecutor asked Jane toward the end of the day Thursday why she decided in recent years to begin speaking honestly about what happened with Kelly, who Jane said she continued to care for and sometimes live with into her 20s.
“I became exhausted living with his lies,” she answered. She added that federal prosecutors assured her she would not be charged with lying to authorities if she testified truthfully at this trial.
Earlier, Jane also became emotional when she was asked to explain why Kelly can be seen handing money to her in the video. She said it was a precaution against anyone accusing him of abusing a child if the video ever fell into the hands of authorities.
“If anyone saw the tape … he wanted it to appear as if I was a prostitute,” Jane said.
She described her parents confronting Kelly in the early 2000s about whether he was having sex with their daughter. Kelly dropped to his knees and begged her parents to forgive him, Jane testified. She said she later implored her parents not to do anything to get Kelly in trouble, telling them she loved him.
As Jane spoke, Kelly mostly stared down at the defence table and rarely looked up at her. She, too, rarely looked in his direction.
Earlier, she testified that Kelly sexually abused her “hundreds” of times before she turned 18 years old, starting when she was 15. She said they were having oral sex in the video and that she was 14 at the time.
Jane told jurors that in the late 1990s when she was 13, she asked the Grammy award-winning singer to be her godfather because she saw him as an inspiration and mentor.
She said within weeks, Kelly would call her and say sexual things. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse.
Asked by a prosecutor how she would know what to do sexually, Jane answered, “He would tell me what to do.” Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. Hundreds.”
A federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to a 30-year prison sentence this year for his 2021 conviction for using his fame to sexually abuse fans.
Speaking softly and tentatively when she first took the stand Thursday, Jane described her upbringing in a musical family in a Chicago suburb, including that she was home-schooled because she was in a touring musical group that she joined when she was about 12.
Jane first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer who worked with Kelly. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents that Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it, and so prosecutors say he conspired to fix that trial.
Kelly has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behaviour. The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly also faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex at the Chicago trial – one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.

"Testigo clave en el caso de R. Kelly declara que el cantante abusó sexualmente de ella ""cientos"" de veces cuando tenía 15 años","Testigo clave en el caso de R. Kelly declara que el cantante abusó sexualmente de ella ""cientos"" de veces cuando tenía 15 años
Actualmente, el músico cumple una condena de 30 años de prisión tras ser declarado culpable por cargos de extorsión y tráfico sexual.
Una mujer que ha sido clave en los problemas legales del rapero R. Kelly, de 55 años, durante más de dos décadas, afirmó este jueves que el cantante abusó sexualmente de ella ""cientos"" de veces cuando era menor de edad, desde que tenía 15 años, recoge AP.
La mujer, ahora de 37 años, bajo el seudónimo de Jane, testificó ante un jurado de Chicago, que a finales de la década de 1990, cuando tenía 13 años, le pidió al cantante ganador del premio Grammy que fuera su padrino porque ella lo veía como una inspiración y un mentor. Sin embargo, comentó que después de eso Kelly comenzó a llamarla y le decía cosas sexuales.
Según su testimonio, la joven tenía 15 años cuando tuvieron relaciones sexuales por primera vez, mientras el artista habría tenido cerca de 30 años en ese momento. ""Él me decía qué hacer"", respondió la víctima a la pregunta de un fiscal sobre cómo sabía qué hacer en la intimidad, y agregó que fueron ""incontables veces. Cientos [de veces]"" las que tuvieron relaciones sexuales antes de cumplir 18 años.
Jane se identificó a sí misma y al cantante como las personas que aparecían en un video antiguo —cuando era adolescente— que, según los fiscales estadounidenses, mostraba a Kelly participando en actos sexuales con una menor de edad. La grabación fue el núcleo del juicio en su contra por pornografía infantil en 2008, del que fue absuelto. El equipo de defensa del rapero argumentó que las identidades de las personas en la cinta estaban en duda, y según varios miembros del jurado la falta de testimonio de la víctima era un impedimento para condenarlo.
No obstanmte, al testificar durante más de cuatro horas, Jane admitió recientemente que le había dicho falsamente al gran jurado estatal que no era ella quien aparecía en el video y que no estaba involucrada sexualmente con Kelly.
Los fiscales indicaron que en ese entonces el músico pagó y amenazó a la víctima para asegurarse de que no declarara en el tribunal. Ella no lo hizo, y finalmente el cantante fue liberado de los cargos.
""Tenía miedo de que algo malo le pasara a Robert"", señaló la joven al jurado cuando le preguntaron por qué no dijo la verdad anteriormente, refiriéndose a Kelly por su nombre completo. ""Lo estaba protegiendo"", agregó.
Además, reveló que ""estaba avergonzada"". ""Tampoco quería que esa persona fuera yo"", añadió.
Por otra parte, un fiscal le preguntó por qué decidió en los últimos años comenzar a hablar honestamente sobre lo que sucedió con Kelly, a quien Jane dijo que siguió cuidando y, a veces, viviendo con él.
""Me cansé de vivir con sus mentiras"", respondió, al tiempo que señaló que los fiscales federales le habían otorgado inmunidad procesal por perjurio relacionado con el falso testimonio anterior si declaraba la verdad en este juicio.
Se espera que la abogada de Kelly, Jennifer Bonjean, interrogue a la mujer el viernes.
El músico, cuyo nombre completo es Robert Sylvester Kelly, ha sido acusado de abusar de mujeres jóvenes y menores de edad durante más de dos décadas. Actualmente, cumple una condena de 30 años de prisión tras ser declarado culpable en junio por cargos de extorsión y tráfico sexual.
Asimismo, se le incrimina por conspirar para intimidar a sus víctimas y ocultar evidencias para obstruir la justicia, incluida la investigación que derivó en 2008 en un proceso judicial por imputaciones de pornografía infantil.",2022-08-19T11:28:26Z,https://actualidad.rt.com,RT en Español

Testemunha de novo julgamento diz que R. Kelly teve sexo com ela “centenas” de vezes quando era menor,"Músico está de novo a ser julgado, não só por abusos sexuais mas também por produção de pornografia infantil e obstrução à justiça. Primeiros contactos sexuais com “Jane” alegadamente começaram quando esta tinha 14 anos.
O cantor norte-americano R. Kelly, que já foi condenado a 30 anos de prisão por abuso sexual de menores, começou esta semana a ser julgado por uma série de outros crimes do mesmo tipo ou que envolvem produção de pornografia infantil. O caso actual assenta sobretudo no testemunho de uma mulher que hoje tem 37 anos e que diz que manteve relações sexuais com R. Kelly “centenas” de vezes antes de ser maior de idade.
O julgamento actual, que decorre em Chicago, teve na quinta-feira o seu pico, com o testemunho da principal queixosa, identificada apenas como “Jane” para proteger a sua identidade. A mulher diz que os contactos sexuais com o cantor começaram quando tinha apenas 14 anos, cita a Associated Press. R. Kelly ter-lhe-á então tocado nas mamas e noutras partes do corpo, relata ainda a agência dando conta do depoimento em tribunal. Ao júri encarregue de analisar este caso foram também mostradas partes de quatro vídeos de conteúdo explícito que o músico terá feito com a testemunha.
Os alegados comportamentos abusivos de R. Kelly com raparigas menores geraram muitos rumores ao longo das últimas décadas; o julgamento que decorreu no ano passado, e em que várias vítimas detalharam não só os actos sexuais a que foram submetidas sem terem idade para os consentir, mas também a teia de manipulação e isolamento em que o músico as manteve durante largos períodos de tempo, foi o culminar dessas suspeitas.
Muitas das acusações contra o cantor de I believe I can fly foram discutidas e expostas na série documental Surviving R. Kelly, de 2019, que iniciou uma espécie de bola de neve mediática a que a era #MeToo veio dar outro arcaboiço junto da opinião pública. A 29 de Junho deste ano, R. Kelly era formalmente condenado a 30 anos de prisão por ter tirado partido da sua fama para sujeitar jovens admiradores a abusos sexuais sistemáticos.
Sexo, dinheiro e grooming
O novo julgamento que se iniciou esta segunda-feira em Chicago diz respeito às acusações de posse de pornografia infantil, exploração sexual de crianças e obstrução à justiça. Deste crime, relacionado com outro caso de posse de pornografia infantil que em 2008 chegou à justiça mas terminou com a absolvição de R. Kelly, são também acusados o seu ex-manager Derrel McDavid e um seu alegado cúmplice, Milton “June” Brown, que terão tentado subornar e ameaçar testemunhas. Os três homens declararam-se inocentes.
A agência Reuters notava há dias que a advogada de Robert Kelly pediu que fosse excluída da lista de jurados qualquer pessoa que tivesse visto Surviving R. Kelly. A equipa de defesa do cantor, cita a BBC, frisa que ele “não é um monstro” e que merece um julgamento justo. “Jane” e um dos vídeos em que estará a ter relações sexuais com R. Kelly sendo ela menor de idade foram também alvo de análise no julgamento de 2008; tanto a testemunha como o cantor negaram então ser eles na gravação.
Esta quinta-feira, “Jane” afirmou que teve relações sexuais com R. Kelly “vezes sem conta” a partir dos seus 15 anos. Foram duas horas de depoimento em que também detalhou encontros sexuais que o cantor terá gravado, nalguns dos quais lhe chama “papá”; num deles, o músico parece estar a dar-lhe dinheiro. Citada pelo diário local Chicago Tribune, “Jane” explicou que tal terá acontecido porque Kelly planeava, “caso o vídeo fosse tornado público por alguma razão”, dizer que a alegada vítima “era uma prostituta”.
A queixosa explicou ainda que tentou proteger R. Kelly durante o julgamento de 2008, reiterando um contexto tornado público já no julgamento de 2021: as jovens com quem o cantor mantinha relações sexuais eram suas fãs e, como tal, manipuladas (“groomed”, no léxico inglês relacionado com a sedução de vítimas menores de crimes sexuais) para acreditar que mantinham relações consensuais e amorosas com o seu ídolo. A defesa de Kelly argumenta que algumas das pessoas que testemunham contra ele são “criminosos” e que no passado receberam dinheiro do músico. Os procuradores acusam precisamente Kelly de ter pago a “Jane” para não testemunhar em 2008.
“Jane” era afilhada de R. Kelly, apadrinhamento que foi a própria a pedir-lhe porque considerava que ele poderia ser seu mentor na música. A jovem era então uma cantora amadora, e inicialmente foi a sua tia a acompanhá-la ao estúdio do cantor. Com o passar do tempo, Kelly terá pagado férias e viagens aos pais e familiares da alegada vítima, isolando-a cada vez mais durante essas viagens.
Se for condenado, Kelly poderá contar com mais anos de prisão após a sentença anterior que já lhe garantiu três décadas encarcerado — na altura do primeiro julgamento, estimava-se que arriscava mesmo cumprir prisão perpétua.",2022-08-19T11:04:54Z,https://www.publico.pt,PÚBLICO

R Kelly i sin tur var i 30-årsåldern. R'n'b-sångaren, som redan nu avtjänar ett trettioårigt fängelsestraff, anklagas för barnpornografi men också för att ha hotat kvinnan till tystnad vid den rättegång som hölls 2008 då hon inte vittnade och då R Kelly friades. Under den nu pågående rättegången förklarade kvinnan att hon vid den tidpunkten varit rädd för att något skulle hända R Kelly.
– Jag skyddade honom.
Men det fanns också andra orsakar till att hon inte ville peka ut sig själv som flickan i videon.
– Jag ville inte att den personen skulle vara jag. Jag skämdes.
Kvinnan uppgav att hon som 13-åring bad R Kelly att bli hennes gudfar eftersom hon såg upp till honom. Under rättegången berättade hon också att R Kelly hade sex med henne ”hundratals gånger” innan hon fyllde 18 år.
R Kelly dömdes tidigare i år till 30 års fängelse för att ha använt sitt kändisskap för att sexuellt utnyttja sina fans.

Witness about R. Kelly: I didn't want to 'carry his lies',"Michael Tarm, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - A woman who says she was sexually abused hundreds of times by R. Kelly as a minor testified Friday that she agonized several years ago about whether to cooperate with federal investigators who were looking into child abuse allegations involving the singer, but she ultimately did because she didn't want to “carry his lies.”
Hours before jurors got their first glimpse of sexually explicit videos at the heart of the prosecution's bid to prove Kelly produced child pornography and successfully rigged his 2008 child porn trial, the woman, who is now 37 and going by the pseudonym “Jane” during the current trial, conceded that even after she began cooperating, she lied when she told agents she wasn't sure if Kelly had abused minors other than her. She said she lied because she didn't want to get others in trouble.
Jane testified for over four hours Thursday, saying it was she and Kelly in a videotape that was the focus of the 2008 trial, at which he was acquitted. She also said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times from the late 1990s before she turned 18. Kelly, 55, was around 30 years old at the time.
While cross-examining her Friday, Kelly's lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, sought to cast the R&B singer in a more favorable light after Jane testified the day before about how Kelly pursued her sexually starting when she was around 14 years old.
Kelly has been trailed for decades by allegations about his sexual behavior. The scrutiny intensified during the #MeToo era and following the 2019 release of the Lifetime television docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Under questioning, Jane said her relationship with Kelly lasted 12 years and continued for two years after his 2008 trial, until she was 26. Bonjean asked if, “after you broke up, you cared about him and he cared about you?” Jane said that was true.
As “Surviving R. Kelly” was coming out, Jane said she was concerned for Kelly and reached out to him. In one text to him, she wrote, “I love you. Don't let the devil win.”
She said she repeatedly tried to contact him in 2019 for advice as she pondered whether to speak to authorities at length about Kelly for the first time. She told jurors: “I felt comfortable enough to reach out to him because I was afraid.”
She decided shortly thereafter to speak to investigators.
“I no longer wanted to carries his lies,” she said.
Kelly, who denies any wrongdoing, was given a 30-year prison sentence by a federal judge in New York earlier this year for a 2021 conviction for using his fame to sexually abuse fans. For the duration of the current trial, he is being held in a federal jail in Chicago, his hometown.
Prosecutors say Kelly intimidated and paid off the girl - Jane - to ensure she didn't testify at the 2008 trial to identify herself and Kelly in the critical video, which the government says Kelly made in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 2000. Jane testified Thursday that she was the girl, then 14, in the video and that Kelly was the man in it.
It was one of three videos that prosecutors played excerpts of on Friday that they said showed Kelly sexually abusing an underage Jane. Before the videos were played on monitors in front of each juror's chair, court officials set up high opaque screens around the jury that blocked journalists and spectators from seeing the videos and jurors' reactions to them.
The sound was audible throughout the courtroom, though, and in one video the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks, “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man is also heard giving her sexually explicit instructions.
Earlier, prosecutors suggested that any viewing of the videos by the public could run afoul of child pornography laws, and they asked Judge Harry Leinenweber to send reporters and spectators out of the courtroom while jurors watched them. The judge rejected the request.
After the acquittal in the 2008 trial, some jurors said afterward that they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because the girl - by then an adult - didn't testify. On the stand Thursday, Jane conceded that she lied to a grand jury in 2002 when she said it wasn't her in the video.
Jane has testified that she met Kelly through an aunt who worked with him, and that she asked Kelly to be her godfather when she was 13. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse.

Some jurors for the 2008 trial, which was on state charges, said that they had no choice but to acquit the R&B star because the girl — by then an adult — didn't testify. On the stand Thursday, Jane conceded that she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said that it was not her in the video.
“I was afraid something bad would happen to Robert,"" she told jurors about why she didn't tell the truth then, referring to Kelly by his full first name. “I was protecting him.""
She added there was another reason she lied about the identity of the person in the video. “I also did not want that person to be me,"" she told jurors. “I was ashamed.”
Kelly's attorney was scheduled to get her chance to cross-examine Jane starting Friday morning.
A prosecutor asked Jane toward the end of the day Thursday why she decided in recent years to begin speaking honestly about what happened with Kelly, who Jane said she continued to care for and sometimes live with into her 20s.
“I became exhausted living with his lies,” she answered. She added that federal prosecutors assured her she would not be charged with lying to authorities if she testified truthfully at this trial.
Earlier, Jane also became emotional when she was asked to explain why Kelly can be seen handing money to her in the video. She said it was a precaution against anyone accusing him of abusing a child if the video ever fell into the hands of authorities.
“If anyone saw the tape ... he wanted it to appear as if I was a prostitute,"" Jane said.
She described her parents confronting Kelly in the early 2000s about whether he was having sex with their daughter. Kelly dropped to his knees and begged her parents to forgive him, Jane testified. She said she later implored her parents not to do anything to get Kelly in trouble, telling them she loved him.
As Jane spoke, Kelly mostly stared down at the defense table and rarely looked up at her. She, too, rarely looked in his direction.
Earlier, she testified that Kelly sexually abused her “hundreds” of times before she turned 18 years old, starting when she was 15. She said they were having oral sex in the video and that she was 14 at the time.
Jane told jurors that in the late 1990s when she was 13, she asked the Grammy award-winning singer to be her godfather because she saw him as an inspiration and mentor.
She said within weeks, Kelly would call her and say sexual things. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse.
Asked by a prosecutor how she would know what to do sexually, Jane answered, “He would tell me what to do.” Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
A federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to a 30-year prison sentence this year for his 2021 conviction for using his fame to sexually abuse fans.
Speaking softly and tentatively when she first took the stand Thursday, Jane described her upbringing in a musical family in a Chicago suburb, including that she was home-schooled because she was in a touring musical group that she joined when she was about 12.
Jane first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer who worked with Kelly. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents that Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it, and so prosecutors say he conspired to fix that trial.
Kelly has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behavior. The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.""
Kelly also faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex at the Chicago trial — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.

Ο καλλιτέχνης, το πλήρες όνομα του οποίου είναι Robert Sylvester Kelly, αντιμετωπίζει 13 ποινικές κατηγορίες, συμπεριλαμβανομένων της καταγραφής και λήψης παιδικής πορνογραφίας, της παρεμπόδισης της δικαιοσύνης και της παρακίνησης ανηλίκων σε σεξουαλική δραστηριότητα.

Η Jane, πρόκειται για ψευδώνυμο που δόθηκε στην 37χρονη για να καταθέσει στη δίκη κατά του 55χρονου, επεσήμανε στους δικαστές πως στα τέλη της δεκαετίας του 1990, όταν ήταν 13 ετών, ζήτησε από τον κατηγορούμενο να γίνει νονός της γιατί τον έβλεπε σαν πηγή έμπνευσης.
Εντός μερικών εβδομάδων, εκείνος άρχισε να την καλεί στο τηλέφωνο και να της κάνει διάφορες δηλώσεις, σεξουαλικού περιεχομένου. Στα 14 την παρενόχλησε σε στούντιο ηχογράφησης και έναν χρόνο αργότερα άρχισε να έχει ολοκληρωμένες επαφές μαζί του. Εκείνη την περίοδο αυτός ήταν περίπου 30 ετών.

Kelly, αυτή τη φορά από τη βαφτιστήρα του, η οποία τον κατηγορεί ότι την ανάγκαζε να έχουν σεξουαλικές επαφές από όταν ήταν ακόμα ανήλικη, στην ηλικία των 14 ετών. O τραγουδιστής κατηγορείται για παιδική πορνογραφία και κατά τη διάρκεια της τέταρτης ημέρας της δίκης του, η 37χρονη σήμερα βαφτιστήρα του κατέθεσε εναντίον του, λέγοντας ότι ήρθε σε επαφή μαζί του εκατοντάδες φορές επειδή φοβόταν να του πει όχι.
Όπως περιέγραψε ενώπιον του δικαστηρίου, όταν ήταν 13 χρονών ζήτησε από τον Kelly να τη βαφτίσει και τα πράγματα πολύ γρήγορα πήραν άλλη μορφή.
Η γυναίκα συγκλονίζει λέγοντας ότι όταν ήταν 14 ετών, την άγγιξε στο στήθος σε ένα στούντιο στο Σικάγο και από τα 15 της άρχισε να έχει σεξουαλικές επαφές μαζί του.

Γνωστή μόνο με το ψευδώνυμο Jane, κατέθεσε ότι έκανε σεξ με τον Kelly «αμέτρητες φορές» μέχρι τα 18 της στο σπίτι του Kelly, στο στούντιο ηχογράφησης, στο λεωφορείο της περιοδείας και σε δωμάτια ξενοδοχείων.
Στην ερώτηση γιατί συνέχισε να κάνει σεξ με τον Kelly, η Jane, όπως αναφέρει το TMZ, είπε στους ενόρκους ότι τον θεωρούσε ως πρόσωπο εξουσίας και δεν ήξερε πώς να τον αντιμετωπίσει. Λέει ότι δεν ήξερε πώς να πει «όχι» στον Kelly και έκανε σεξ μαζί του για τόσο πολύ καιρό που άρχισε να αισθάνεται ότι ήταν κάτι φυσιολογικό.

R Kelly trial: Woman tells court singer had sex with her 'hundreds' of times before she was 18,"A key witness in the latest trial against R Kelly has said the R&B singer had sex with her ""hundreds"" of times before she turned 18 years old, starting when she was 15.
Giving evidence under the pseudonym Jane, she said she first met Kelly when she was about 13 at a recording studio in the late 1990s. She said her aunt was a professional singer who worked with Kelly.
She said shortly afterwards she had asked Kelly to be her godfather because she saw him as an inspiration and mentor, but within weeks of that she alleges he would call her and say sexual things.
WARNING: This article contains graphic content
The Grammy award-winning singer - who is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence for his conviction in a New York this year on federal charges that he used his fame to sexually abuse fans - is now on trial for child pornography and obstruction of justice charges in his hometown of Chicago.
The most serious charge against him is conspiracy to obstruct justice by allegedly rigging a 2008 trial on state child pornography charges stemming from a purported video of him and Jane having sex when she was underage.
Kelly is accused of both bribing and threatening Jane to ensure that she did not testify at that trial and paying for her family to travel to the Bahamas and Cancun, Mexico. Jane did not testify, and Kelly was ultimately acquitted.
He is also standing trial on charges of producing child pornography and enticing minors for sex.
Jane told the court Kelly first touched her breasts and other parts of her body when she was around 14 at a Chicago recording studio, and that around that time, he ""started penetration"" at his home at his North Side Chicago home.

She described her upbringing in a musical family in a Chicago suburb, including that she was home-schooled because she was in a touring musical group that she joined when she was about 12.
Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video at the centre of the 2008 trial-rigging charge in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home between 1998 and 2000. In it, the girl - who prosecutors say is Jane - is heard calling the man ""daddy"".
Federal prosecutors say that she and Kelly had sex hundreds of times over the years in his homes, recording studios and tour buses.
Kelly rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, and prosecutors say he fixed the 2008 trial in a bid to protect his career from total destruction.
The court has also heard that before the 2008 trial, Kelly carried a duffle bag full of sex tapes everywhere he went. Court filings say some tapes later went missing.
In the 2000s, bootleg copies of some videos appeared on street corners throughout the US.
Kelly - who also faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex - denies any wrongdoing.
The singer has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behaviour. The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary Surviving R Kelly.
Two of Kelly's associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants in the case. They also deny wrongdoing.",2022-08-19T09:26:00Z,https://news.sky.com,Sky News
Jornal de Brasília,"Ela esteve no julgamento federal do artista nesta quinta-feira (18)
Uma ex-afilhada de R. Kelly, 55, afirmou ter mantido relações sexuais “centenas de vezes” com o cantor antes de completar 18 anos. Atualmente, ela tem 37 anos e usa o pseudônimo Jane. Segundo o site TMZ, ela se apresentou nesta quinta (18) no julgamento federal do artista, em Chicago.
Ela afirmou que tinha apenas 15 anos quando começou a ter relações sexuais com o então padrinho. Jane disse que não conseguia dizer não por se sentir intimada demais. Ela teria pedido para Kelly ser seu padrinho em 1990, quando tinha apenas 13 anos.
Segundo a suposta vítima, a primeira interação sexual entre os dois foi quando ela tinha cerca de 14 anos, e o cantor tocou seu seio dentro de um estúdio de gravação em Chicago. Jane afirmou que as relações sexuais aconteciam na casa do artista, no estúdio de gravação, ônibus de turnê e até mesmo em quartos de hotel.
Jane contou que ele também fazia sexo com outras adolescentes que a mandava recrutar. Em setembro de 2021, ele foi condenado por tráfico sexual, em um júri que aconteceu no tribunal federal do Brooklyn durante cinco semanas e meia. Os jurados deliberaram por pouco mais de um dia antes de votarem pela condenação em todas as acusações.
Deveraux Cannick, advogado de Kelly, disse a jornalistas do lado de fora do tribunal que a defesa estava “desapontada”. A audiência de sentença foi marcada para o dia 4 de maio de deste ano. O cantor, cujo nome completo é Robert Sylvester Kelly, é uma das pessoas mais influentes julgadas por crimes sexuais depois do movimento #MeToo, que amplificou as acusações que o perseguiam desde o início dos anos 2000.",2022-08-19T09:23:00Z,https://jornaldebrasilia.com.br,Jornal de Brasília

Jurors in R. Kelly’s federal trial watched graphic clips Friday of three separate videos allegedly showing the R&B superstar sexually assaulting his young goddaughter in the late 1990s.
While the visuals were obscured from view, courthouse observers could hear much of the audio. A woman testifying under the pseudonym “Jane” identified herself in court Thursday as the girl in the tapes and Kelly as the man, testifying that she was 14 years old when they were filmed.

On the clips, Jane was heard speaking in a high and very young-sounding voice. On one clip, she referred to her “14-year-old” genitals repeatedly. On another she repeated the phrase, as did the man alleged to be Kelly.
“Get on your knees,” Jane was told in another clip. “Daddy, do you still love me?” she responded.

“Of course I do,” was the answer.
Jane could be heard getting directions at several points on what she should do.
“I said don’t move,” the man alleged to be Kelly said on one clip.
“I’m sorry,” Jane responded.
Kelly’s defense so far has not directly contested that it is Kelly on the video clips, only saying that their authenticity could not be verified and that Kelly was previously acquitted for conduct related to them. Nor has the defense given jurors an alternate version of Jane’s narrative of events related to videos. Instead, the defense lawyers are seeking to sow doubt by telling the panel Jane denied it was her on the clips for more than two decades.
Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber to clear the courtroom of media and spectators while the tapes were played since they contained alleged child pornography.
But Leinenweber declined, saying that forcing everyone to leave a public trial was too extreme and that having people hear the audio wasn’t “problematic.” Instead, he had courtroom personnel bring in large, black screens so spectators could not see the jurors or their monitors as they watched. Due to COVID-19 spacing protocols, the jury is seated in the courtroom gallery rather than in the jury box.

Spectators and reporters in the courtroom, meanwhile, were asked to sit in specific areas so they could not see the videos as they played on monitors at the defense and prosecution tables.

Just before the videos were played, Leinenweber, at the request of prosecutors, ordered the audio feed to the overflow courtroom and media room cut off. No explanation for that move was given.
The videos are at the heart of the case against Kelly and his two co-defendants, who are accused of conspiring to pay off victims and witnesses and cover up years of alleged sexual abuse of minors by Kelly.
Earlier Friday, Kelly’s attorney cross-examined the victim allegedly depicted on the videos, who is being referred to by the pseudonym “Jane.” The woman, now 37, spent about four hours testifying on direct examination Thursday that Kelly struck up a clandestine sexual relationship with her when she was an impressionable young teenager in the 1990s.
Kelly’s lead attorney Jennifer Bonjean, however, focused her initial cross-examination on Jane’s adulthood. She showed Jane a long series of text messages between Jane and Kelly dating from 2018 and 2019, establishing that the two had relatively recent contact.
The texts were friendly, with Jane inviting Kelly to a birthday celebration and the two exchanging happy new year greetings. After Lifetime’s explosive “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary series premiered in January 2019, Jane sent him messages of support.

“I love you, don’t let the devil win,” she texted him. Kelly responded with “yeah, I was on a major breakdown but now I’m on a major buildup.”

“He wasn’t trying to influence you to do anything, you were just commiserating,” Bonjean said, which Jane confirmed.
And in February 2019, the Cook County state’s attorney’s office contacted Jane — it was in possession of more video allegedly involving her and Kelly. Jane texted Kelly: “you need to call me right away or I’m making decisions on my own.”
Bonjean asked Jane whether that meant she was demanding Kelly pay her for her continued silence. In response, Jane slowly put the cap back on her water bottle, paused and said calmly into the microphone, “That is not correct.”
“The decision I was going to make was to cooperate with the authorities because I no longer wanted to carry his lies,” she said.
Jane remained composed under questioning from Bonjean, maintaining eye contact as each question was asked and often giving succinct one-word answers.
In Jane’s initial interviews with federal prosecutors in 2019 she refused to discuss a relationship with Kelly and refused to watch any videos, she testified. Bonjean repeatedly asked whether that was her own decision, and she acknowledged it was.

Bonjean also hinted aggressively that Jane only changed her mind about cooperating with federal authorities in 2019, after learning that she could seek restitution. Prosecutors objected to this line of questioning and called for a sidebar before the timeline could fully be worked out.
Jane, for her part, said she had not yet made up her mind about whether she would seek restitution if Kelly is convicted.
After about an hour, Bonjean’s questioning turned to Jane’s teen years; she testified Thursday that she had sexual contact with Kelly beginning when she was just 14, and from ages 15 to 18 had intercourse with Kelly “innumerable” times.
Bonjean was audibly skeptical that Jane’s parents would not have known and that, as Jane testified, Kelly would have trusted other underage girls to keep their threesomes with him and Jane a secret.
“You’re still adamant that your parents at that point were blissfully unaware of this relationship, right?” Bonjean asked, after noting how much time Jane must have been spending away from them.
“Yes, because they thought I was around (Kelly’s) family,” Jane responded. “They didn’t know I was spending time with him separately.”

Two women are expected to testify later at trial that they had sexual contact with Kelly and Jane while they were underage; Bonjean said in opening statements this week that they are lying and only had sex with Kelly after they could legally consent.
Bonjean’s cross-examination hit a technical snag when she was trying to show Jane her text messages with Kelly without revealing certain identifying information such as her phone number.
After making what they thought were all the necessary redactions, Kelly’s defense team put the texts on the screen, but apparently had forgotten to black out one portion that contained Jane’s first and last name.
After it had been up on the screen for a few seconds, a loud whisper went up at the defense table and the exhibit was quickly taken down.
On cross-examination, Jane reiterated that her aunt Stephanie “Sparkle” Edwards was the one who pushed her to get closer to Kelly. It is also Jane’s understanding that Edwards is the one who initially leaked the pornographic tape to former Sun-Times journalist Jim DeRogatis, she says.
“You think Sparkle was pushing Kelly on you … used you as bait with Kelly,” Bonjean said, and Jane affirmed.

When prosecutors questioned her on redirect examination, Jane acknowledged that the bulk of their texts merely had to do with scheduling matters.
After about another two and a half hours on the stand, Jane was dismissed.

R. Kelly’s lawyer gets chance to question government witness,"Jane, now 37, paused, tugged at a necklace and dabbed her eyes with a tissue as she said publicly for the first time that the girl in the video was her and that the man was Kelly.
Jane, the pseudonym used for her during the trial, has been central to Kelly’s legal troubles for more than two decades. She testified for over four hours Thursday, telling jurors it was her and Kelly in a videotape that was at the heart of his 2008 child pornography trial, at which he was acquitted.
CHICAGO (AP) — R. Kelly’s legal team will get its chance to question the government’s star witness on Friday after she gave what jurors could see as damning testimony against Kelly at his federal trial in Chicago on charges that include the production of child pornography.

When a prosecutor asked Jane how old she was at the time the video was shot, she said quietly: “14.” Kelly, 55, would have been around 30 years old at the time.
In addition to charges of child pornography and enticement of minors, Kelly faces charges of conspiring to rig that 2008 trial by intimidating and paying off the girl to ensure she didn't testify then.
Some jurors who presided over that 2008 trial, which was on state charges, said that they had no choice but to acquit the R&B star because the girl — by then an adult — didn't testify. On the stand Thursday, Jane conceded that she lied to a state grand jury in 2002 when she said that it was not her in the video.
“I was afraid something bad would happen to Robert,"" she told jurors about why she didn't tell the truth then, referring to Kelly by his full first name. “I was protecting him.""
She added there was another reason she lied about the identity of the person in the video. “I also did not want that person to be me,"" she told jurors. “I was ashamed.”

Dressed in a white dress coat and removing a face mask before testifying, Jane remained on the witness stand for over four hours for the government. Kelly's attorney was scheduled to get her chance to cross-examine Jane starting Friday morning.
A prosecutor asked Jane toward the end of the day Thursday why she decided in recent years to begin speaking honestly about what happened with Kelly, who Jane said she continued to care for and sometimes live with into her 20s.
“I became exhausted living with his lies,” she answered. She added that federal prosecutors assured her she would not be charged with lying to authorities if she testified truthfully at this trial.
Earlier, Jane also became emotional when she was asked to explain why Kelly can be seen handing money to her in the video. She said it was a precaution against anyone accusing him of abusing a child if the video ever fell into the hands of authorities.
“If anyone saw the tape ... he wanted it to appear as if I was a prostitute,"" Jane said.
She described her parents confronting Kelly in the early 2000s about whether he was having sex with their daughter. Kelly dropped to his knees and begged her parents to forgive him, Jane testified. She said she later implored her parents not to do anything to get Kelly in trouble, telling them she loved him.

As she spoke, Kelly mostly stared down at the defense table and rarely looked up at her. She, too, rarely looked in his direction.
Earlier, she testified that Kelly sexually abused her “hundreds” of times before she turned 18 years old, starting when she was 15. She said they were having oral sex in the video and that she was 14 at the time.
Jane told jurors that in the late 1990s when she was 13, she asked the Grammy award-winning singer to be her godfather because she saw him as an inspiration and mentor.
She said within weeks, Kelly would call her and say sexual things. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse.
Asked by a prosecutor how she would know what to do sexually, Jane answered, “He would tell me what to do.” Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
A federal judge in New York sentenced Kelly to a 30-year prison sentence this year for his 2021 conviction for using his fame to sexually abuse fans.
Speaking softly and tentatively when she first took the stand Thursday, Jane described her upbringing in a musical family in a Chicago suburb, including that she was home-schooled because she was in a touring musical group that she joined when she was about 12.
Jane first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer who worked with Kelly. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents that Kelly was going to be her godfather.

Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it, and so prosecutors say he conspired to fix that trial.
Kelly has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behavior. The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.""
Kelly also faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex at the Chicago trial — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.

Child sex tapes played for jury,"Three child sex tapes at the center of R. Kelly’s latest sex abuse trial were played for a jury in Chicago on Friday.
Federal prosecutors said the videos showed Kelly sexually assaulting a girl when she was as young as 14, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Kelly is already serving a 30-year sentence after he was convicted in Brooklyn federal court of using his fame to run a decades-long sex trafficking scheme.
The alleged victim in the Chicago trial, now 37 and testifying under the pseudonym Jane, spoke publicly about the years of abuse she suffered under Kelly for the first time on Thursday when her testimony began.

Special accommodations were made in the courtroom Friday so the jury could view the videos because of their graphic nature, according to the Tribune.
In one video, Jane referred to her “14-year-old” genitals multiple times. In another, the man told her, “Get on your knees” and Jane responded, “Daddy, do you still love me?”
The man in the videos repeatedly gave Jane directions.
Kelly’s defense attorneys have not contested that he is the man in the video, and they have not provided any version of events to counter the one Jane described on Thursday and Friday.
Jane explained to the jury that Kelly began grooming her shortly after they met when she was 13 years old. She said Kelly started groping her at age 14 and that by 15 he “started penetration.”

A sex tape with Jane was at the center of Kelly’s 2008 child pornography trial in Illinois. Jane did not testify at that trial, and Kelly was acquitted in part because jurors doubted she was the one in the video.
As recently as 2019, Jane defended Kelly and refused to cooperate with federal prosecutors, the Tribune reported. However, she changed her mind and decided to testify against him at the latest trial.
“The decision I was going to make was to cooperate with the authorities because I no longer wanted to carry his lies,” she testified Friday.

Prior to that decision, Jane had denied for years that she was the one in the video. Kelly’s defense team hammered that point, the Tribune reported.
At the federal trial in Chicago, Kelly is charged with four counts of enticing minors for sex, child pornography and obstruction of justice.
The obstruction of justice charge is tied to the 2008 child-porn trial. The feds say Kelly paid off Jane’s family with trips to the Bahamas and Mexico, then isolated her in hotels during the proceedings.

While cross-examining the woman who was in R. Kelly's infamous sexual assault tape when she was 14 years old, the singer's attorney suggested on Friday that she was only cooperating with prosecutors for financial gain.
The woman, who is only identified as ""Jane,"" told the Chicago federal jury and attorney Jennifer Bonjean that she doesn't even know whether she will seek restitution in the case.
""You called Robert because you wanted to work out a situation where he would pay you,"" Bonjean said, referring to a call Jane made to Kelly after the the docuseries ""Surviving R. Kelly"" premiered.
""No,"" Jane responded.
The disgraced R&B artist is already serving a 30-year sentence out of New York federal court, where prosecutors proved that he had ran a decades-long sex trafficking enterprise though his music business.
More than 40 witnesses testified in the New York trial last summer.
Numerous women — and two men — who testified against him at that trial said that he lured them into sexual slavery after promising to help their careers in the music industry — promises he almost never kept.
The women, many of whom were teenagers when they met Kelly, testified that he directed them to have sex with him and each other and said the singer obsessively videotaped the sexual encounters.
Now Kelly is on trial in Chicago, where he has pleaded not guilty to additional sex crimes related to producing child pornography.
The case primarily touched on the sex tapes that were a part of were a part of a 2008 Illinois child pornography trial in which Kelly was acquitted after the witness declined to take the stand. Now 37, Jane cooperated with prosecutors and testified for more than four hours on Thursday, before Friday's cross-examination.

On Thursday, Bonjean presented detailed text messages between Jane and Kelly before and after the ""Surviving R. Kelly"" docuseries was released in 2019.
After the Cook County state attorney's office tried to reach her on February 14, 2019, Jane texted Kelly, ""You need to call me right away or I'm making decisions on my own.""
Bonjean also referenced a post by Jane's brother on Instagram where he said a non-profit he runs will collaborate with Grey Goose after the trial, but Jane said she isn't making any money from that.
Lawyers said Friday that a detective would be called to the stand as they present clips of the sexual abuse to the jury.

Witness about R. Kelly: I didn't want to 'carry his lies',"CHICAGO (AP) — A woman who says she was sexually abused hundreds of times by R. Kelly as a minor testified Friday that she agonized several years ago about whether to cooperate with federal investigators who were looking into child abuse allegations involving the singer, but she ultimately did because she didn’t want to “carry his lies.”
Hours before jurors got their first glimpse of sexually explicit videos at the heart of the prosecution’s bid to prove Kelly produced child pornography and successfully rigged his 2008 child porn trial, the woman, who is now 37 and going by the pseudonym “Jane” during the current trial, conceded that even after she began cooperating, she lied when she told agents she wasn’t sure if Kelly had abused minors other than her. She said she lied because she didn’t want to get others in trouble.
Jane testified for over four hours Thursday , saying it was she and Kelly in a videotape that was the focus of the 2008 trial , at which he was acquitted. She also said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of times from the late 1990s before she turned 18. Kelly, 55, was around 30 years old at the time.

While cross-examining her Friday, Kelly’s lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, sought to cast the R&B singer in a more favorable light after Jane testified the day before about how Kelly pursued her sexually starting when she was around 14 years old.
Kelly has been trailed for decades by allegations about his sexual behavior. The scrutiny intensified during the #MeToo era and following the 2019 release of the Lifetime television docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Under questioning, Jane said her relationship with Kelly lasted 12 years and continued for two years after his 2008 trial, until she was 26. Bonjean asked if, “after you broke up, you cared about him and he cared about you?” Jane said that was true.
As “Surviving R. Kelly” was coming out, Jane said she was concerned for Kelly and reached out to him. In one text to him, she wrote, “I love you. Don’t let the devil win.”
She said she repeatedly tried to contact him in 2019 for advice as she pondered whether to speak to authorities at length about Kelly for the first time. She told jurors: “I felt comfortable enough to reach out to him because I was afraid.”
She decided shortly thereafter to speak to investigators.
“I no longer wanted to carry his lies,” she said.
Kelly, who denies any wrongdoing, was given a 30-year prison sentence by a federal judge in New York earlier this year for a 2021 conviction for using his fame to sexually abuse fans. For the duration of the current trial, he is being held in a federal jail in Chicago, his hometown.
Prosecutors say Kelly intimidated and paid off the girl — Jane — to ensure she didn’t testify at the 2008 trial to identify herself and Kelly in the critical video, which the government says Kelly made in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home around 2000. Jane testified Thursday that she was the girl, then 14, in the video and that Kelly was the man in it.
It was one of three videos that prosecutors played excerpts of on Friday that they said showed Kelly sexually abusing an underage Jane. Before the videos were played on monitors in front of each juror’s chair, court officials set up high opaque screens around the jury that blocked journalists and spectators from seeing the videos and jurors’ reactions to them.

The sound was audible throughout the courtroom, though, and in one video the girl is heard repeatedly calling the man “daddy.” At one point she asks, “Daddy, do you still love me?” The man is also heard giving her sexually explicit instructions.
Earlier, prosecutors suggested that any viewing of the videos by the public could run afoul of child pornography laws, and they asked Judge Harry Leinenweber to send reporters and spectators out of the courtroom while jurors watched them. The judge rejected the request.
After the acquittal in the 2008 trial, some jurors said afterward that they had no choice but to acquit Kelly because the girl — by then an adult — didn’t testify. On the stand Thursday, Jane conceded that she lied to a grand jury in 2002 when she said it wasn’t her in the video.

Jane has testified that she met Kelly through an aunt who worked with him, and that she asked Kelly to be her godfather when she was 13. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse.

R. Kelly's 'Goddaughter' Tells a Damning Tale,"(Newser) – A woman who has been central to R. Kelly’s legal troubles for more than two decades testified Thursday that the R&B singer had sex with her “hundreds” of times before she turned 18 years old, starting when she was 15, per the AP. Jane—the pseudonym for the now 37-year-old woman at Kelly’s trial on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges—told jurors that in the late 1990s when she was 13, she asked the singer to be her godfather because she saw him as an inspiration. She said within weeks, Kelly would call her and say sexual things. She said he first touched her breasts and other parts of her body when she was around 14 at a Chicago recording studio, and that around that time, he “started penetration” at his home at his North Side Chicago home.
She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Kelly, 55, would have been around 30 years old at the time. Asked by a prosecutor how she would know what to do sexually, Jane answered, “He would tell me what to do.” Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.” Kelly, who is serving a 30-year prison sentence for his conviction in a New York this year on federal charges alleging he used his fame to sexually abuse fans, is standing trial in his hometown of Chicago on several other federal charges.
Among the most serious is conspiracy to obstruct justice by allegedly rigging a 2008 trial on state child pornography charges stemming from a purported video of him and Jane having sex when she was underage. Among other things, prosecutors say Kelly paid off and threatened Jane to ensure that she didn’t testify at that trial. She didn’t, and he was ultimately acquitted. Unlike at his 2008 trial, Jane cooperated with prosecutors leading up to the current trial and is a pivotal witness.

Das Mädchen aus dem Video?: Frau belastet R. Kelly,"Der frühere Popstar R. Kelly ist bereits zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt worden - doch nun könnte sich seine Strafe noch einmal um Jahrzehnte verlängern. Eine Frau wirft ihm sexuellen Missbrauch vor. Sie soll in einem 20 Jahre alten Beweisvideo zu sehen sein.
Eine Frau hat dem ehemaligen Pop-Superstar R. Kelly vorgeworfen, sie als Minderjährige vielfach missbraucht zu haben.

Woman Testifies That R. Kelly Sexually Abused Her in Infamous Tape When She Was 14,"As previously indicated in 2019, a woman who has identified herself as the underage girl in the infamous VHS tape with R. Kelly testified today (August 18) in the federal trial against the singer, The New York Times and Chicago Tribune report. The woman took the stand in the Chicago courtroom, where she testified that she appeared in the tape, that she was 14 at the time, and that she was repeatedly sexually abused by Kelly as a minor. That video and others are the basis for the child pornography and obstruction charges that Kelly is facing.
The tape, showing Kelly engaging in sex acts with a 14 year old, was anonymously mailed to reporter Jim DeRogatis in February 2002. That year, Kelly was charged with making child pornography. The now 37-year-old woman who was referred to in court today as “Jane” refused to testify against him in 2008. At the time, she denied their relationship to law enforcement, and her lack of participation led to Kelly’s acquittal.
In court today, the woman claimed Kelly coached her on what to say before the grand jury in 2008—to be “strong and stern” in denying their relationship and her appearance in the tape. When asked today why she lied under oath at the time, the woman replied, “Because I was afraid to expose Robert. I also did not want that person to be me. I was ashamed.”
The woman testified that she gave Kelly’s lawyers a necklace of hers that could be seen in the tape, as well as her passport where she can be seen wearing the same necklace in her photo. She claimed that Kelly flew her and her parents out of the country to make them unavailable to investigators and media, and that after he was acquitted, he physically abused her and controlled her ability to leave his residence.
For hours, she testified about her relationship with Kelly. She testified about being urinated on in the tape, and she explained why Kelly handed her money at the start of a different video from around that same time. “Because if anybody saw the tape or if it was released for some reason, he wanted it to appear as if I was a prostitute,” she testified.
She also testified that her cooperation with prosecutors is in exchange for immunity from prosecution for perjury. Kelly’s lawyer Jennifer Bonjean is expected to cross-examine the woman on Friday.
Kelly’s current Chicago trial follows his trial in Brooklyn, New York federal court, where he was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Kelly is appealing that verdict and sentence.

R. Kelly's former goddaughter testifies he had sex with her,"R. Kelly’s former goddaughter gave damning testimony about the R&B legend in court on Thursday — claiming he had sex with her “hundreds of times” when she was a minor and forced her to pose as prostitute to shut her up.
The now-37-year-old woman, known only as “Jane,” described how Kelly videotaped himself having oral sex with her at his home in Chicago when she was 14 years old, during the fourth day of the singer’s federal child pornography trial.
She said the disgraced singer gave her Champagne, instructed her to refer to her genitalia as “14 years old” then urinated on her, according to the Chicago Tribune.

In another video from around the time, Kelly was shown handing her money before having sex with her in his wood-paneled jacuzzi room, she testified.
Asked by a prosecutor why the superstar had given her cash, Jane burst into tears on the stand.
“Because if anybody saw the tape or if it was released for some reason he would say I was a prostitute,” she said.
Jane testified that the Grammy-winning star had sex with her “innumerable times” after that, sometimes along with other teenage girls whom Kelly requested that she recruit.
Two of the other minor victims are expected to testify against Kelly later in the trial. Jurors are also expected to be shown video footage of the star having sex with minors.
Prosecutors have alleged that the singer paid off Jane and her family so she wouldn’t testify in his 2008 child pornography trial. He was ultimately acquitted in that case.

Woman Testifies R. Kelly Sexually Abused Her on Video When She Was 14,"Before that, the 2008 trial was the closest Mr. Kelly had gotten to being held accountable.
The woman at the center of that trial, now 37, took the stand at the Everett M. Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in downtown Chicago, where she said that she had been repeatedly sexually abused as a teenager by Mr. Kelly and testified that it was in fact her at age 14 appearing in the videotape, which at one point shows Mr. Kelly urinating on her.
Testifying under a pseudonym for more than four hours on Thursday, the woman told the court that in 2002, after law enforcement officials had obtained the tape, Mr. Kelly sent her and her parents out of the country to make them inaccessible to investigators. He then urged her to deny to a grand jury that it was her on the tape and paid for a lawyer to accompany her, she said. She testified that she had falsely told the grand jury that it was not her on the videotape and that she was not sexually involved with Mr. Kelly. She said that she gave Mr. Kelly’s lawyers a necklace of hers that could be seen on the videotape.
As the woman spoke, Mr. Kelly — who is facing charges of coercing minors into sex, receiving child sexual abuse videos and conspiring to obstruct justice — remained impassive.
The woman told the jury that she was 13 years old when she was first introduced to Mr. Kelly by her aunt, a protégée of Mr. Kelly’s who goes by the stage name Sparkle. Mr. Kelly, who became the woman’s godfather, started speaking sexually with her over the phone, she said, then started abusing her physically. She testified that Mr. Kelly would sexually assault her at various locations, including his home, the recording studio and his tour bus.",2022-08-19T00:04:02Z,https://www.nytimes.com,The New York Times
Kelly leads Trump-backed Masters by 8 points in Arizona Senate race: poll,"Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly (D) is leading his Trump-backed opponent Blake Masters (R) by 8 percent in the state’s Senate race, according to a new poll by Fox News.
Fox News found that 50 percent say that they will back Kelly, while 42 percent say they support venture capitalist Masters.
The Arizona Senate race is one of the least certain, and nonpartisan election newsletter Cook Political Report has called the election a “toss-up.”
The Fox News poll, conducted this week, also found Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs leading her Republican opponent Kari Lake (R) by a slight 3 percent, which is within the poll’s margin of error.
Forty-seven percent said that they would vote for Secretary of State Hobbs in November, while 44 percent favored former television anchor Lake.
The percentage of support for Kelly is close to the percentage that voted for him in 2020 (51.2 percent) in his race against Republican Martha McSally.
McSally received 48.8 percent of the vote in Arizona that year, higher than the share who say that they will support Masters.
Masters has been vocal about his support for Trump, saying that he would support a 2024 presidential run by the former president, and received Trump’s own support leading up to the Republican primary in Arizona.
Only 82 percent of Republicans are backing Masters, according to the poll, while a significantly higher 95 percent of Democrats say that they support Kelly. Ten percent of Republicans say that they favor Kelly over Masters.",2022-08-18T23:47:17Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill

Alleged child sex tape victim testifies R. Kelly had sex with her 'hundreds' of times before she turned 18,"CHICAGO — The teenage girl whose alleged sexual relationship with the singer R. Kelly led to child pornography charges against the singer in 2008 testified Thursday that the singer began having sex with her when she was 15 and he was in his 30s and continued to do so ""hundreds"" of times before she turned 18.
The girl, who is now 37 and being identified by the pseudonym Jane in court, is the prosecution's star witness in Kelly's federal trial on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges.
Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is being tried alongside his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and associate, Milton “June” Brown. They are both accused of conspiring with Kelly to intimidate and bribe witnesses and cover up evidence in his 2008 criminal trial in Cook County, which involved a video recording of him allegedly sexually abusing a minor.
On Thursday, Jane testified that she was the person who appeared in that video with Kelly. She did not testify in the 2008 trial, and, at the time, her parents repeatedly denied she was the girl in the recording. Kelly was acquitted. He has denied any wrongdoing.
Jane testified Thursday that she had sex with the disgraced singer “hundreds” of times from age 15 to 18. Under questioning from prosecutors, she said she did so because she was intimidated by him and considered him an ""authoritative figure.""
Jane also testified that she first met Kelly when she was 12 or 13 years old at a church gospel concert.
“He was a superstar,” she said. ""I was excited to meet him. I knew who he was as an artist and I aspire to be in the music industry.”
The second time she met him, Jane testified, was through an introduction from a relative after an event where Jane’s music group had performed. The relative was in a romantic relationship with Kelly at the time, Jane said.
""After my show, he was telling me how great of a job I did and he gave me pointers to handle the stage,"" Jane testified. “It was great to hear from such a successful person that I was gifted.”
Soon after, Jane said, she started seeing him more at his home studio with her relative, who told her she should ask him to be her godfather if she wanted her music career to advance.
The relative, Jane testified, told her that she ""should sit on his lap, rub his head and ask him if he will play that role for me and my life.”
Jane, who was 14 at the time, said the relationship turned sexual within weeks of that day, beginning with phone sex and progressing to oral sex. She testified that she was 15 when they first had intercourse.
Because he was her godfather, she said, her parents didn’t ask him any questions and felt comfortable with her staying at his house and spending time in the studio because they thought they were making music together.
“When he became my godfather, it was normal for me to be with him without my [relative] there,"" Jane said.
At Kelly's request, she also recruited friends from school to join them for sex.
“I considered myself a submissive person and I wanted to give him what he wanted,” she said.
Jane said Kelly told her to keep the relationship a secret and told her to remain ""loyal"" to him.
She admitted to lying to a grand jury and to police about the relationship to protect Kelly and and to keep from her parents to find.
“I was going to take that to my grave,” she said.
When her parents found out about the relationship when the video was released, Jane said, her father erupted in anger at Kelly. But they eventually acquiesced to Kelly's plan to deny that Jane was in the video because they feared they would lose her, she said.
Jane said she decided to come forward a few years ago because she ""became exhausted with living with his lies.”
Jane testified on the second day of witness testimony in the trial, which began Monday with jury selection. She will return to the stand Friday under cross examination.
Prosecutor Jason Julien said Wednesday that Kelly had sex with minors on numerous occasions, recorded many of the alleged assaults on VHS tapes and then paid people who knew about the recordings to keep quiet when he faced criminal charges of child pornography in 2008.
Julien said Kelly had a “dark side” and kept a “hidden world” behind his fame and status.
Kelly is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence after being convicted last year in New York City on charges of federal racketeering and sex trafficking.
Kelly's attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, told jurors during opening statements Wednesday that they will have to decide whether they believe the accusers and witnesses to be credible, pointing out that Jane had previously denied that she was the person in the video with Kelly.",2022-08-18T22:00:36Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News

Getuige zegt dat R. Kelly haar ‘honderden keren’ misbruikt heeft,"Een vermeend slachtoffer van R. Kelly heeft donderdag in de rechtbank in Chicago verteld dat de zanger haar zeker honderden keren seksueel misbruikt heeft toen ze minderjarig was. De nu 37-jarige getuige, die onder het pseudoniem Jane getuigt, zou de persoon zijn die te zien is de seksvideo die ook al tijdens het proces tegen de zanger in 2008 als bewijs werd opgevoerd.
Jane, die de voormalige peetdochter van Kelly zou zijn, vertelde donderdag tijdens de zittingsdag in het Dirksen Federal Courthouse dat zij voor het eerst seksueel contact met R. Kelly had toen zij 14 jaar was. Ze vertelde ook dat ze in die tijd samen met andere minderjarige vrouwen seks met de zanger had. Gevraagd naar hoe vaak Jane seks heeft gehad met Kelly, antwoordde dat dat ""ontelbaar. Heel vaak... honderden"" keren moet zijn geweest.
De getuigenis van Jane is belangrijk in het proces tegen Kelly dat op 15 augustus jongstleden van start ging. Zij zou namelijk ook al getuigen in het proces tegen R. Kelly in 2008, maar trok zich terug na het vertonen van een seksvideo waarin zij te zien zou zijn. Er werd in die tijd gezegd dat Kelly getuigen had gemanipuleerd en betaald om niet te getuigen, wat er mede toe zou hebben geleid dat de zanger op dat moment vrijgesproken werd van seksueel misbruik van minderjarigen en het vervaardigen van kinderporno. Die verdenking van manipulatie komt later nog aan bod tijdens het huidige proces in Chicago.
Tijdens de getuigenis donderdag vertelde Jane dat zij en de zanger elkaar hadden ontmoet tijdens een gospelconcert bij haar kerk. Jane was op dat moment 12 of 13 jaar en de leadzangeres van een band. Niet lang na hun eerste ontmoeting kwam de zanger kijken bij een optreden van haar band en overlaadde haar met complimenten. In de rechtbank vertelde Jane dat ze daarvan genoot. ""Het maakte me blij dat zo'n succesvol persoon zei dat ik begaafd was"", tekende de Chicago Sun Times op. In de periode daarna ontmoette ze hem vaker en leidde dat op den duur steevast tot seks.
Kelly staat sinds half augustus in Chicago terecht voor meerdere aanklachten van seksueel misbruik van minderjarigen en voor onder meer het vervaardigen van kinderporno. Eind juni werd Kelly in New York al schuldig bevonden voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken. De zanger, die al sinds 2019 vastzit, werd veroordeeld tot een celstraf van dertig jaar.

R. Kelly's Alleged Victim Testifies That They Had Sex When She Was 15,"R. Kelly is back in court for his federal trial in Chicago. The case surrounds his 2008 trial where he was accused of witness tampering. After yesterday's opening statements, one of R. Kelly's alleged victims took the stand.
The alleged victim, who is now 37 years old, testified against the singer today in court, claiming that he began having sex with her when she was only 15 years old. Though she's only known as Jane in the court documents, she is the former goddaughter of the singer. She explained that they had sex ""innumerable times"" before she turned 18-years-old, and explained that she was too intimidated as a minor to say no, especially since she looked at him as an authority figure in her life at the time. She said that the encounters began feeling normal to her over time.

The alleged victim told the jury that he began touching her when she was 14 years old at his Chicago recording studio. She said things escalated to intercourse when she was 15 years old and Kelly was near twice her age, and they engaged in intercourse at various places from the singer's home to his hotel rooms and tour bus.
The alleged victim also claimed that she would help Kelly recruit other teenage girls for sex. She added that Kelly actually taped their encounters, as well.
It's a turn of events in Kelly's case since this is the same victim who prosecutors claimed was in the underage sex tape at the center of the singer's 2008 trial. However, she didn't take the stand back then. She and her parents denied that there was ever anything inappropriate between the two, while Kelly frequently faced allegations of witness tampering.

Woman testifies frequent abuse by R Kelly before she was 18,"A woman who has been central to R. Kelly’s legal troubles has testified that the R&B singer sexually abused her “hundreds” of times before she was 18.
A woman who has been central to R. Kelly’s legal troubles for more than two decades testified Thursday that the R&B singer sexually abused her “hundreds” of times before she turned 18 years old, starting when she was 15.
Jane — the pseudonym for the now 37-year-old woman at Kelly’s trial on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges — told jurors that in the late 1990s when she was 13, she asked the Grammy award-winning singer to be her godfather because she saw him as an inspiration and mentor.
She said within weeks, Kelly would call her and say sexual things. She said he first touched her breasts and other parts of her body when she was around 14 at a Chicago recording studio, and that around that time, he “started penetration” at his home at his North Side Chicago home. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Kelly, 55, would have been around 30 years old at the time.
Asked by a prosecutor how she would know what to do sexually, Jane answered, “He would tell me what to do.” Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Kelly, who is serving a 30-year prison sentence for his conviction in a New York this year on federal charges alleging he used his fame to sexually abuse fans, is standing trial in his hometown of Chicago on several other federal charges. Among the most serious is conspiracy to obstruct justice by allegedly rigging a 2008 trial on state child pornography charges stemming from a purported video of him and Jane having sex when she was underage.
Prosecutors say Kelly paid off and threatened Jane to ensure that she didn’t testify at that trial. She didn’t, and he was ultimately acquitted.
Kelly is also standing trial on charges of producing child pornography and enticing minors for sex.
Unlike at the 2008 trial, Jane cooperated with prosecutors leading up to the current trial and is a pivotal witness.
During opening statements Wednesday, prosecutor Jason Julien sought to prepare jurors for the testimony of accusers including Jane, reminding them that a core issue at trial remained the exploitation of often scared and confused children — even though the accusers who would speak to jurors are now grown adults.
Speaking softly and tentatively when she first took the stand Thursday, Jane described her upbringing in a musical family in a Chicago suburb, including that she was home-schooled because she was in a touring musical group that she joined when she was about 12.
Jane first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer who worked with Kelly. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents that Kelly was going to be her godfather.
As her testimony continued, Jane sounded calmer and steadier, answering questions matter-of-factly.
Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video of Jane in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home between 1998 and 2000. In it, the girl is heard calling the man “daddy.” Federal prosecutors say that she and Kelly had sex hundreds of times over the years in his homes, recording studios and tour buses.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it, and so prosecutors say he conspired to fix that trial.
According to prosecutors, Kelly told the parents and Jane to leave Chicago, paying for them to travel to the Bahamas and Cancun, Mexico. When they returned, prosecutors say Kelly sought to isolate Jane, moving her around to different hotels. When called before a state grand jury looking into the video, Jane, her father and mother denied it was her in it.
Tears streamed down his faced on June 13, 2008, when he was acquitted on all counts of child pornography. Some of the jurors told reporters after the trial that they weren’t convinced that the female in the video was who state prosecutors said she was.
Before the 2008 trial, Kelly carried a duffle bag full of sex tapes everywhere he went for years, but some tapes later went missing, according to court filings. In the 2000s, bootleg copies of some videos appeared on street corners throughout the U.S.
In the early 2000s, the aunt showed the parents a copy of a video she said depicted their daughter having sex with Kelly. When they confronted Kelly, he told them, “You’re with me or against me,” a government filing says.
The parents took it as a threat.
Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behavior. The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.""
Kelly also faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.
Prosecutors told jurors that the evidence includes at least three videos showing Kelly having sex with underage girls.",2022-08-18T20:38:00Z,https://www.wltx.com,WLTX.com

A conviction in Chicago could add decades to a 30-year prison sentence he already received from a New York federal judge this year for convictions on charges that he used his fame to sexually abuse other young fans. Different accusers testified at that trial.
Jane first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents that Kelly was going to be her godfather.
Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video of Jane in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home between 1998 and 2000, when she was as young as 13. In it, the girl is heard calling the man “daddy.” Federal prosecutors say that she and Kelly had sex hundreds of times over the years in his homes, recording studios and tour buses.

When they returned, prosecutors say Kelly sought to isolate Jane, moving her around to different hotels.

Accuser and star witness testifies at R Kelly trial,"CHICAGO – A woman who prosecutors say R. Kelly manipulated for sex starting when she was about 14 years old took the witness stand Thursday at Kelly’s child pornography and obstruction of justice trial, becoming the first accuser to testify in the singer’s hometown of Chicago.
The woman — now 37 and referred in pretrial filings as “Minor 1” and during the trial by the pseudonym, “Jane” — has been a central figure in Kelly’s legal troubles going back more than 20 years. Prosecutors say a video Kelly took of himself having sex with Jane around the year 2000 led to the first investigations of the singer.
Speaking softly and tentatively at first, Jane described her upbringing in a musical family in a Chicago suburb, including that she was home-schooled because she was in a touring musical group that she joined when she was about 12.
Among the most serious charges the Grammy Award winner faces at the federal trial is conspiracy to obstruct justice by allegedly rigging a 2008 trial on state child pornography charges stemming from the purported video of him and Jane having sex. Among other things, prosecutors say Kelly paid off and threatened Jane to ensure that she didn't testify at that trial. She didn't, and he was ultimately acquitted.

Woman Describes Sexual Abuse by R. Kelly Since She Was 13,"A woman who has been central to R. Kelly’s legal troubles for more than two decades testified Thursday that the R&B singer sexually abused her “hundreds” of times before she turned 18 years old.
Jane — the pseudonym for the now 37-year-old woman at Kelly’s trial on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges — told jurors that in the late 1990s when she was 13, she asked the Grammy award-winning singer to be her godfather because she saw him as an inspiration and mentor.
She said within weeks, Kelly would call her and say sexual things. She said he first touched her breasts and other parts of her body when she was around 14 at a Chicago recording studio, and that around that time, he “started penetration” at his home at his North Side Chicago home. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Kelly, 55, would have been around 30 years old at the time.
Asked by a prosecutor how she would know what to do sexually, Jane answered, “He would tell me what to do.” Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”

Kelly, who is serving a 30-year prison sentence for his conviction in a New York this year on federal charges alleging he used his fame to sexually abuse fans, is standing trial in his hometown of Chicago on several other federal charges. Among the most serious is conspiracy to obstruct justice by allegedly rigging a 2008 trial on state child pornography charges stemming from a purported video of him and Jane having sex when she was underage.
Prosecutors say Kelly paid off and threatened Jane to ensure that she didn’t testify at that trial. She didn’t, and he was ultimately acquitted.
Kelly is also standing trial on charges of producing child pornography and enticing minors for sex.
Unlike at the 2008 trial, Jane cooperated with prosecutors leading up to the current trial and is a pivotal witness.
During opening statements Wednesday, prosecutor Jason Julien sought to prepare jurors for the testimony of accusers including Jane, reminding them that a core issue at trial remained the exploitation of often scared and confused children — even though the accusers who would speak to jurors are now grown adults.
Speaking softly and tentatively when she first took the stand Thursday, Jane described her upbringing in a musical family in a Chicago suburb, including that she was home-schooled because she was in a touring musical group that she joined when she was about 12.
Jane first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer who worked with Kelly. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents that Kelly was going to be her godfather.
As her testimony continued, Jane sounded calmer and steadier, answering questions matter-of-factly.
Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video of Jane in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home between 1998 and 2000. In it, the girl is heard calling the man “daddy.” Federal prosecutors say that she and Kelly had sex hundreds of times over the years in his homes, recording studios and tour buses.
After R&B star R. Kelly was found guilty of nine federal counts of racketeering and sex trafficking, attorney Gloria Allred, who represented several of Kelly’s victims, spoke out about the heinous nature of his crimes, including knowingly spreading genital herpes and using child pornography to blackmail his victims into compliance.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it, and so prosecutors say he conspired to fix that trial.

"R. Kelly's Fiancée Doubles Down On Pregnancy Claims After Lawyer Calls Her ""Insane""","R. Kelly's fiancée is doubling down on claims that she's pregnant with the imprisoned singer's child. Last week, Joycelyn Savage revealed in an excerpt from her tell-all book, Love & Joy Of Robert, that she is carrying his child.
""Months later, I began expecting severe morning sickness and was unsure what was wrong with my body. I thought I had contracted COVID-19, but the most amazing news of all was that I was expecting,” she wrote. “It was a happy day but an incomplete time in my life. Today I am grateful to God for giving me the most precious gift. Robert is extremely excited about the news that I am having a baby and feels sad that Robert will not be able to be here with us.”

Though his legal team denied the claim and labeled Savage ""insane,"" she's doubled down and shared a sonogram of her child in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. She said that she is ""very excited"" and explained why R. Kelly's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, shared disparaging remarks about her.
""His lawyer didn't know that prior to him going to jail, Robert and I were doing IVF because at the time I was told I couldn't have a baby,"" she said.
""When he got sent to prison, we paused on it and I had them freeze my eggs until I was ready,"" Savage continued. ""Once his lawyer did find out, she wanted me to have an abortion because she didn’t feel that now was the time for me to have a child following the 30-year sentence. Me and Robert wanted to have a child for a long time. He is very happy about it, his lawyer isn’t. Once I told her I was keeping my baby, she didn’t want me to announce but I wanted to share the news. I’ve always been there for him even before this new lawyer came into the picture.""
Thus far, Kelly's legal team hasn't responded to her claims but we'll keep you updated when they do.

Erst im Juni wurde der einstige Popstar zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt – jetzt drohen ihm weitere Jahrzehnte hinter Gittern!
Sexualstraftäter R. Kelly (55) muss sich seit Mittwoch (17. August) wegen weiterer schwerer Vorwürfe vor einem Gericht in Chicago verantworten. Es geht um Pädophilie und Kinderpornografie. Die Beweislast ist erdrückend – und widerlich …
„Der Angeklagte Robert Kelly hatte Sex mit mehreren Kindern. Er machte Videobänder von sich selbst beim Sex mit kleinen Kindern“, soll Ankläger Jason Julien am Mittwoch laut CNN in seinem Eröffnungsplädoyer gesagt haben.
Sie sollen ihn rausboxen: Die Anwältinnen von R. Kelly, Jennifer Bonjean (l.) und Ashley Cohen
Auch ein mutmaßliches Opfer von Kelly soll aussagen: Ankläger Julien kündigte eine Frau an, die vor 20 Jahren in einem Video von Kelly zu sehen war.
Der weltbekannt gewordene Film ist an Abscheulichkeit kaum zu übertreffen: Kelly soll die damals 14-Jährige sexuell missbraucht und auf sie uriniert haben.
Das Video wird in dem Prozess eine zentrale Rolle spielen. Denn Kelly war in einem früheren Prozess zu dem Fall 2008 freigesprochen worden.
Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft ihm nun vor, das Opfer damals unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit sie nicht in dem Prozess aussagt.
► Insgesamt ist Kelly in 13 Punkten angeklagt: unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen, der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen und der Behinderung der Justiz.
Auch zwei seiner früheren Angestellten sind angeklagt.
R. Kelly wurde in New York zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt
Erst im Juni wurde Kelly zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt. Ein Gericht in New York wies dem Sänger ähnliche Horror-Taten nach.
So soll Kelly die „Leitung einer kriminellen Vereinigung, die Frauen und Kinder für Sex rekrutierte“ gespielt haben. Heißt: Er baute sich ein Netzwerk aus Gewalt, Erpressung und Angst zum Zwecke seiner sexuellen Befriedigung auf.
Gerüchte wegen Übergriffen auf Frauen, viele von ihnen damals minderjährig, hatte es bereits seit den Neunzigern gegeben. 2002 wurde der Musik-Superstar („I Believe I Can Fly“) erstmals wegen Kinderpornografie angeklagt, jedoch 2008 in Chicago freigesprochen.
Erst die MeToo-Bewegung kochte die schlimmen Vorwürfe wieder hoch. Nach der packenden TV-Doku „Surviving R. Kelly“ zimmerten Bundesstaatsanwälte in New York eine letztendlich erfolgreiche Anklage zusammen. 2021 kam es zum Schuldspruch.
Was in Chicago passiert, bleibt noch abzuwarten. Die Chancen für Kelly auf einen Freispruch stehen aber sehr schlecht …",2022-08-18T13:25:20Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD
R. Kelly's Fiancée Says She's Pregnant Amid Singer's Second Sex Abuse Trial,"R. Kelly's fiancée, Joycelyn Savage, has announced that she is expecting a baby with the jailed singer, as he faces his second sex abuse trial.
Savage, 26, has said that she is five months pregnant and is expecting a girl with 55-year-old Kelly—despite his lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, previously denying a claim recently made in a book that the two are having a baby together.
Responding, a ""very excited"" Savage has shared a sonogram with Entertainment Tonight, and explained that Kelly's lawyer ""didn't know that prior to him going to jail, Robert and I were doing IVF because at the time I was told I couldn't have a baby.""
In June, Kelly was given a 30-year prison sentence in New York after being found guilty on nine counts of sex-trafficking and federal racketeering. Attorneys for Kelly, who has denied all wrongdoing, have announced plans to appeal the ruling.
""When he got sent to prison, we paused on it and I had them freeze my eggs until I was ready,"" Savage told Entertainment Tonight. ""Once his lawyer did find out, she wanted me to have an abortion because she didn't feel that now was the time for me to have a child following the 30-year sentence.
""Me and Robert wanted to have a child for a long time. He is very happy about it, his lawyer isn't. Once I told her I was keeping my baby, she didn't want me to announce but I wanted to share the news. I've always been there for him even before this new lawyer came into the picture.""
Kelly has three adult children from a previous marriage.
Newsweek has asked representatives of Kelly for comment.
Savage, who met and moved in with Kelly when she was 19, stated in a letter of support shared with Judge Ann Donnelly in June that she is engaged to the musician. The letter was shared several days before Kelly's sentencing in the sex trafficking case.
""I'm writing this letter in support of Robert in advance of his sentencing, so I can explain to the court that I'm not the victim that the government has portrayed me to be,"" she stated.
Writing that she and Kelly ""have a very special connection and are deeply in love,"" she added of the star: ""Robert is not the monster that the government has described him to be. The Robert I know is very sweet, gentle, and kind.""
Savage first moved from Atlanta to Chicago to live with Kelly in hopes of advancing her music career. Her family approved of their working relationship early on, but as time passed, her parents became wary of Kelly's intentions.
Savage's parents have previously spoken extensively about her lack of communication and alleged ""brainwashing."" They alleged she was a victim of Kelly and that they had tried endlessly to contact her through the media.
Kelly is currently at the start of a second federal trial, charged with child pornography, sexual exploitation of children and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. As with his previous charges, Kelly denies all of the allegations.
He was previously incarcerated at a Brooklyn prison, but was moved to a Chicago detention center on July 12 ahead of the trial starting.
According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate database, Kelly is currently an inmate at the Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center.",2022-08-18T12:59:38Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek
Getuige R. Kelly: ’Honderden keren misbruikt’,"Jane, die de voormalige peetdochter van Kelly zou zijn, vertelde donderdag tijdens de zittingsdag in het Dirksen Federal Courthouse dat zij voor het eerst seksueel contact met R. Kelly had toen zij 14 jaar was. Ze vertelde ook dat ze in die tijd samen met andere minderjarige vrouwen seks met de zanger had. Gevraagd naar hoe vaak Jane seks heeft gehad met Kelly, antwoordde dat dat „ontelbaar. Heel vaak... honderden” keren moet zijn geweest.
De getuigenis van Jane is belangrijk in het proces tegen Kelly dat op 15 augustus jongstleden van start ging. Zij zou namelijk ook al getuigen in het proces tegen R. Kelly in 2008, maar trok zich terug na het vertonen van een seksvideo waarin zij te zien zou zijn. Er werd in die tijd gezegd dat Kelly getuigen had gemanipuleerd en betaald om niet te getuigen, wat er mede toe zou hebben geleid dat de zanger op dat moment vrijgesproken werd van seksueel misbruik van minderjarigen en het vervaardigen van kinderporno. Die verdenking van manipulatie komt later nog aan bod tijdens het huidige proces in Chicago.
Tijdens de getuigenis donderdag vertelde Jane dat zij en de zanger elkaar hadden ontmoet tijdens een gospelconcert bij haar kerk. Jane was op dat moment 12 of 13 jaar en de leadzangeres van een band. Niet lang na hun eerste ontmoeting kwam de zanger kijken bij een optreden van haar band en overlaadde haar met complimenten. In de rechtbank vertelde Jane dat ze daarvan genoot. „Het maakte me blij dat zo’n succesvol persoon zei dat ik begaafd was”, tekende de Chicago Sun Times op. In de periode daarna ontmoette ze hem vaker en leidde dat op den duur steevast tot seks.
Kelly staat sinds half augustus in Chicago terecht voor meerdere aanklachten van seksueel misbruik van minderjarigen en voor onder meer het vervaardigen van kinderporno. Eind juni werd Kelly in New York al schuldig bevonden voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken. De zanger, die al sinds 2019 vastzit, werd veroordeeld tot een celstraf van dertig jaar.
De zanger wordt al sinds de jaren negentig beschuldigd van (kinder)misbruik. Kelly heeft altijd gezegd onschuldig te zijn.",2022-08-18T10:10:00Z,https://www.telegraaf.nl,Telegraaf.nl

Kellys Anwältin Jennifer Bonjean bat die Jury, ihren Mandanten nicht als Monster zu betrachten, als das die Anklage ihn darstelle. Er sei ein Mensch, der nicht perfekt sei. Seine mangelnde Bildung habe Kelly gezwungen, sich in Zeiten seiner zunehmenden Popularität auf andere zu verlassen, argumentierte die Anwältin, die Kelly als Analphabeten beschrieb. Sein Umfeld habe ihn mitunter vom rechten Weg abgebracht. „Auf seinem Weg von der Armut zum Ruhm ist er gestolpert.“
Aber sie sei zuversichtlich, dass die Geschworenen ihn letztendlich für nicht schuldig befinden würden. Zudem betonte sie in ihrem Eröffnungsplädoyer, dass die angekündigte Aussage der Zeugin im Widerspruch mit ihren Darstellungen in der Vergangenheit steht: „In den letzten 22 Jahren hat sie unerbittlich bestritten, dass sie es in diesem Video war. Bevor es zu strafrechtlichen Ermittlungen kam, hat sie es bestritten. Sie hat es wiederholt gegenüber Staatsanwälten bestritten, sie hat es gegenüber Sozialarbeitern und Polizeibeamten bestritten. Sie hat es unter Eid vor einer Grand Jury bestritten.“ Der Prozess soll etwa einen Monat dauern. Kelly drohen erneut Jahrzehnte der Haft.",2022-08-18T09:35:02Z,https://www.welt.de,WELT

They, too, are expected to testify. Prosecutors told jurors that the evidence includes at least three videos showing Kelly having sex with underage girls. Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.

She is expected to be the prosecution’s star witness in ‘I Believe I Can Fly’ singer Kelly’s trial on allegations he made child pornography and enticed underage girls for sex. The singer is accused of having sex with the girl when she was 14 and she allegedly recorded some of their hundreds of sexual encounters. Kelly is said to have threatened and paid off the girl and allegedly videotaped himself having sex with her when he was about 30. The tapes showing the alleged encounters were part of a 2008 Illinois child pornography trial in which Kelly was acquitted after the witness declined to take the stand.

Kelly’s lead lawyer Jennifer Bonjean urged the jury to reject the prosecution’s portrayal of the singer. She said: “When the government wants to paint him as a monster, remember we are talking about a human being.” Ms. Bonjean also warned jurors about what she described as a “mob justice climate” surrounding the case, referring to the six-part documentary ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ and social media posts about his behaviour.

"USA: ""Mädchen Hunderte Male misshandelt"" - R. Kelly steht erneut vor Gericht","USA : «Mädchen Hunderte Male misshandelt» – R. Kelly steht erneut vor Gericht
Der gefallene Superstar wurde bereits zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt. Nun geht es im Prozess gegen R. Kelly vor einem Bundesgericht in Chicago wieder um mutmassliche sexuelle Handlungen mit Minderjährigen.

Darum gehts Der ehemalige Pop-Superstar R. Kelly steht erneut wegen sexueller Misshandlung vor Gericht.
Zuvor wurde er bereits zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt.
Laut den Klägern habe Kelly mit mehreren Minderjährigen Hunderte Male Sex gehabt.
Mit dem Eröffnungsplädoyer der Staatsanwaltschaft hat am Mittwoch ein weiterer Prozess gegen den verurteilten Popsänger R. Kelly begonnen. In dem Verfahren um die sexuelle Misshandlung von Minderjährigen und Kinderpornografie gehe es um die dunkle und verborgene Seite des Beschuldigten, sagte Staatsanwalt Jason Julien den Geschworenen. Kelly wurde bereits wegen Sexualstraftaten zu 30 Jahren Haft verurteilt.
Kelly soll Kinderpornos gefilmt haben
Kelly sei weltberühmt durch seinen Hit «I Believe I Can Fly», sagte Julien. Dies sei seine öffentliche Seite. Er habe aber auch eine dunkle, verborgene Seite und die stehe im Mittelpunkt des Prozesses. Der Sänger muss sich vor dem Bundesgericht in seiner Heimatstadt Chicago verantworten, weil er Minderjährige zu sexuellen Handlungen verleitet und kinderpornografisches Material hergestellt haben soll. Ausserdem soll er seinen Prozess wegen Kinderpornografie von 2008 manipuliert haben, in dem er damals freigesprochen wurde.
Kellys Anwältin Jennifer Bonjean bat die Jury, ihren Mandanten nicht als Monster zu betrachten, als das die Anklage ihn darstelle. Er sei ein Mensch, der nicht perfekt sei. Seine mangelnde Bildung habe Kelly gezwungen, sich in Zeiten seiner zunehmenden Popularität auf andere zu verlassen, argumentierte die Anwältin, die Kelly als Analphabeten beschrieb. Sein Umfeld habe ihn mitunter vom rechten Weg abgebracht. «Auf seinem Weg von der Armut zum Ruhm ist er gestolpert.» Aber sie sei zuversichtlich, dass die Geschworenen ihn letztendlich für nicht schuldig befinden würden.
«Hunderte Male Sex mit Minderjährigen»
Julien bemühte sich dagegen in seinen Ausführungen, den Geschworenen ein Gefühl für das Ausmass von Kellys mutmasslichen Taten zu vermitteln. Kelly habe wiederholt Sex mit Minderjährigen gehabt, die gerade 14, 15 und 16 Jahre alt gewesen seien – «mehrere Mädchen, Hunderte Male». Julien beschrieb auch, wie Kelly sie manipuliert, kontrolliert und geschlagen habe, wenn die Opfer seine Regeln nicht befolgten. Er kündigte auch an, als Beweismittel mindestens drei Videos zu präsentieren, die Kelly beim Sex mit minderjährigen Frauen zeigen sollen. Am Mittwochabend reichte die Staatsanwaltschaft dann eine der Aufnahmen ein, die im Zentrum des Strafverfahrens von 2008 gestanden hatte.
Nach dem damaligen Freispruch für Kelly hatten einige Geschworene erklärt, dass ihnen keine andere Wahl geblieben sei, weil das Mädchen in dem Video nicht habe aussagen wollen. Im neuen Prozess soll die heute 37-Jährige – in den Gerichtsakten nur als «Minor 1» bezeichnet – aber als Kronzeugin der Staatsanwaltschaft auftreten. Die Jury wird sich auch mit der Frage beschäftigen, ob Kelly «Minor 1» bedrohte und bestach, damit die damals Minderjährige ihn nicht belasten würde. Einer der Anklagepunkte gegen den gefallenen Star lautet daher auf Behinderung der Justiz.
Zwei Mitarbeiter von Kelly sind in Chicago ebenfalls angeklagt. Einer wird beschuldigt, dem Sänger geholfen zu haben, den Prozess 2008 zu manipulieren, der andere soll Kinderpornografie von Kelly angenommen haben. Beide bestreiten wie auch Kelly alle Vorwürfe.

Darin soll der Musiker sie sexuell missbraucht und auf sie uriniert haben.
Nur wenige Wochen nach seiner Verurteilung zu 30 Jahren Haft wegen des Missbrauchs Minderjähriger ist Kelly in Chicago in 13 Punkten angeklagt: Unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen, der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen und der Behinderung der Justiz.

Testimony expected to continue Thursday in R. Kelly trial,"The woman had been testifying for more than four hours Thursday about her clandestine sexual relationship with R&B superstar R. Kelly as an impressionable young teenager when she was asked about one of the central mysteries in the case.
Why, after two decades of silence, did she finally decide to come forward and speak out?

There was a lengthy, silent pause in the Chicago federal courtroom. The woman, testifying under the pseudonym “Jane” looked down, pursed her lips and began to fidget nervously in her chair.
“I became exhausted with living with his lies,” Jane said finally.

The response punctuated a stunning day on the stand for Jane, now 37, the star witness in Kelly’s child pornography trial unfolding at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, where the now-disgraced singer and two former associates stand accused of conspiring to cover up years of Kelly’s sexual misconduct.
In taking the stand, Jane was telling her story publicly for the first time after refusing to cooperate years ago with investigators who were looking into a sex tape Kelly made with her in the late 1990s.
R. Kelly lawyer to cross-examine woman who testified she was teen on infamous sex video. Read more here >>>
Jane’s lack of cooperation left a glaring gap in Kelly’s 2008 trial in Cook County, where jurors said they simply could not agree about whether the girl on the pornographic tape was actually her, as prosecutors alleged. In the years that followed, while Kelly’s career soared and then tanked amid repeated accusations of other sexual misconduct, Jane and her parents remained stalwartly silent.
That all changed on Thursday. Dressed in a white blazer with her hair in long braids, Jane took the jury through a harrowing tale of alleged grooming, sexual abuse and cover-up, beginning when she first had sexual contact with Kelly at just 14.
She remained composed for much of her time on the stand, testifying in a soft but matter-of-fact tone about how she came into Kelly’s orbit and how their mutual love of music and basketball sparked a friendship despite the age gap.
But Jane’s voice grew quieter and began to break as she was asked to describe sexual encounters that Kelly recorded, including the now-infamous tape at the center of Kelly’s 2008 trial.
One of the videos, which are expected to be played for jurors, showed Jane and Kelly having oral sex in the living room of his Lakeview home, she said. He could be seen giving her Champagne and telling her to refer to her genitalia as 14 years old, she said. Then he urinated on her, she said in a voice almost too soft to hear, dabbing tears from her eyes.

On another video from about the same time, Jane testified, filmed in the wood-paneled Jacuzzi room in the basement of Kelly’s home in Chicago’s Lakeview neighborhood, Kelly appeared to hand her money before they have sex.
When a prosecutor asked why he gave her money, Jane started to cry audibly, saying after a long pause: “Because if anybody saw the tape or if it was released for some reason, he wanted it to appear as if I was a prostitute.”
As she said it, Jane looked sadly down at the table in front of her. Seated at the defense table across the courtroom, Kelly shook his head.
Their sex acts escalated to intercourse when she was 15, she said. Asked how she knew her exact age, Jane calmly responded, “Because that’s when I lost my virginity.”
After that, they had sex “innumerable times,” sometimes along with other teenage girls whom Jane recruited at Kelly’s request, she said. The encounters took place in Kelly’s home on West George Street, at his Near West Side recording studio, on tour buses and in hotels in Chicago and elsewhere, she said.
Two of the other minor victims are also expected to testify against Kelly later in the trial.

To illustrate how young she looked at the time of the encounters, prosecutors had Jane identify two photos of herself from her childhood. The first, taken when she was a sophomore in high school, showed her on one knee holding a basketball, smiling. The other was a headshot from when she was in a music group at 13 — around the time she said she first met Kelly.
Kelly, 55, is charged with 13 counts of production of child pornography, conspiracy to produce child pornography and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Some of the counts carry a mandatory minimum of 10 years behind bars if convicted, while others have ranges of five to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors are also seeking a personal money forfeiture of $1.5 million from Kelly.
Also on trial are Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.
Regardless of the outcome, Kelly is still facing decades in prison. In June, he was sentenced to 30 years on federal racketeering charges brought in New York. He is appealing both the jury’s verdict and the sentence in that case.
In opening statements Wednesday, prosecutors painted Kelly as a serial predator, who had sexual contact with underage girls hundreds of times over the years. Five women including “Pinky” and “Jane” are expected to testify over the course of the trial that Kelly sexually abused them when they were teenagers.
Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said prosecutors’ case hinges on the testimony of liars, extortionists (and) people who engaged in the business of trafficking pornography.”

Bonjean will have the opportunity to cross-examine Jane on Friday.
Jane told the jury Thursday that when Chicago police first began investigating her relationship with Kelly in 2000, she denied it because he’d told her he’d be ruined if it came out.
“That was something I would take to my grave,” she said, adding that Kelly told her she “did a good job answering their questions.”
Things escalated in early 2002, however, when her aunt, Stephanie “Sparkle” Edwards, told her “there was a sex tape leaked” depicting Jane and Kelly and that it was going to go public. She said Kelly continued to “stress how important it was to continue to deny it.”
A short time later, Kelly met with Jane and her parents to tell them the truth about their relationship and to apologize and try to keep them on his side, she said. “I just remember my dad storming out,” Jane testified. “He was saying, ‘I can’t help you, I can’t help you.’ ... He was hysterical.”
Jane said Kelly decided to sent them to the Bahamas and Cancun so they would not be “accessible” to police and the media.

“There was a lot of negative attention happening around the videotape and Robert wanted us to leave the country to pretty much clear our heads and figure out approaches going forward,” Jane testified.
Jane testified that when she got back from the trip several weeks later, Kelly and his associates, including his high-powered Chicago legal team, amped up the pressure to hide any evidence of their illegal relationship.
In one of the videos, Jane is wearing a distinctive cross necklace, she said — the same one she was wearing in her passport photo at the time. Kelly’s lawyers insisted that she turn over both the necklace and the passport to them, she testified.
Also, Kelly was concerned about a tattoo of a heart with Kelly’s name on it that she got when she was out of the country with her parents. When she showed it to Kelly, he said it would be a problem: “You can’t have a tattoo like that with everything going on,” he said, according to her testimony.
Kelly arranged for her to have the tattoo shaded with a different design to obscure his name, she testified. And it was Brown who drove her to the tattoo artist’s house, according to Jane.
In April 2002, when Jane was summoned to testify before a Cook County grand jury, Kelly coached her on how to act and what to say, emphasizing how important it was to remain loyal to him. She said he repeatedly told her “how strong and stern I had to be in denying our relationship and the sex tape.”

Jane lied to grand jurors, telling them she was not involved with Kelly sexually and they had not made any videos. She also was shown images of herself from the video, and denied that they were her.
When prosecutors asked why she lied under oath, she sighed heavily. She took a long pause. When she began to speak, her voice was shaking.
“Because I was afraid to expose Robert,” she said. “... I also did not want that person to be me. I was ashamed.”
Jane acknowledged that in exchange for her testimony at the federal trial, she has been granted immunity from prosecution for perjury at the state grand jury.
While Kelly was awaiting trial on the Cook County charges, Jane said she moved into his mansion in south suburban Olympia Fields. He wanted her to be closer to him — “under his wing,” Jane said.
It was during that period that he became abusive, spanking her and hitting her, she said – particularly when she would try to leave.

“To leave or even to stay, both seemed difficult,” she said.
She ultimately moved out when she was 23 or 24, but Kelly continued to help her pay her rent and gave her a car so she could get to work, according to her testimony. Once, in 2014, a check he gave her had the word “settlement” written on it – even though there was never any settlement between the two, she said.
Jane had met Kelly nearly two decades before that, when she was just a star-struck kid, she said. She was thrilled when he attended a performance of her music group and gave her good feedback.
“It made me feel happy that such a successful person was saying I was gifted, so I was excited,” she said.
She began to visit Kelly’s studio regularly when she was 12 or 13, along with Edwards, her aunt, who was a protegee of Kelly’s.
Edwards advised her she should ask Kelly to be her godfather, she testified.

“(She said) I should sit on his lap and rub his head and ask him to play that role in my life,” Jane testified. She did, and Kelly “chuckled a bit, and said yes.”
After that, their relationship took a sexual turn, Jane said. She would have long phone conversations with him that eventually turned explicit, she said. She was 13 years old.
Kelly also gave her alcohol for the first time when she was 14, and she began drinking heavily.
“It would help me loosen up, kind of take me away from the moment,” she testified.
For most of her testimony, Jane remained calm on the witness stand, keeping her gaze on the prosecutor asking her questions, pausing at times to sweep her braids off her shoulder or wipe at her eyelashes.
Prosecutors earlier called to the witness stand Matthew Hulsizer, who in 2001 purchased a big house in Lakeview: a converted church with a swimming pool and basketball court and a barbershop. The previous owner, he came to find out, was R. Kelly.

After moved in, Hulsizer said he found out that a smoke detector in at least one of the bedrooms was not in fact a smoke detector at all — it concealed a small hidden video camera. And in order to leave the bedroom, you had to press a button, he said, a feature he removed since he thought it was a safety hazard.
In 2002, police evidence technicians came through to take photos, including pictures of the wood-paneled room depicted on the tape involving Jane.
Jurors were shown some of the photos during Hulsizer’s testimony, including the basketball court that doubled as an homage to Kelly’s success, with a large cartoon mural painted on one wall depicting the Looney Tunes characters from the movie “Space Jam.”
The cartoon included a likeness of Kelly on the court in red uniform and sunglasses, according to photos presented by the government, playing with the Tasmanian Devil.

Some in the crowd of cartoon characters, which included Tweety Bird and Marvin the Martian, were holding up signs.
The “Colorado Room” looked like the interior of a log cabin with faux wood walls and an accent wall that appeared to be fake stone. A large hot tub dominated the room, also ensconced in fake wood paneling.

Earlier Thursday, retired Chicago police detective Daniel Everett reiterated that when he spoke to “Jane” and her parents in 2000 they denied that the girl had any kind of inappropriate relationship with Kelly.

A little more than a year later, he got a tape from then-Chicago Sun-Times journalist Jim DeRogatis and recognized “Jane” on the footage. That video became the center of Kelly’s Cook County court case 20 years ago.
Defense attorneys hit hard on chain-of-custody issues surrounding the tape. Everett noted that he has recently seen a copy of the footage and the content is the same, but he does not know where the original VHS tape is.
On cross-examination from Bonjean, Everett noted that he also interviewed a friend of Jane’s in 2002. That person is expected to testify later at trial under the pseudonym “Pinky.”
There is no indication in Everett’s reports that underage Pinky told him she had sexual contact with Kelly, Everett testified. And while there were concerns that a videotape depicted images of Pinky being abused, when Everett showed her and her mother stills from the tape, they denied it any involvement, he testified.

Woman describes frequent sex with R. Kelly before she was 18,"CHICAGO (AP) — A woman who has been central to R. Kelly’s legal troubles for more than two decades testified Thursday that the R&B singer sexually abused her “hundreds” of times before she turned 18 years old, starting when she was 15.
Jane — the pseudonym for the now 37-year-old woman at Kelly’s trial on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges — told jurors that in the late 1990s when she was 13, she asked the Grammy award-winning singer to be her godfather because she saw him as an inspiration and mentor.
She said within weeks, Kelly would call her and say sexual things. She said he first touched her breasts and other parts of her body when she was around 14 at a Chicago recording studio, and that around that time, he “started penetration” at his home at his North Side Chicago home. She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse. Kelly, 55, would have been around 30 years old at the time.
Asked by a prosecutor how she would know what to do sexually, Jane answered, “He would tell me what to do.” Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times. … Hundreds.”
Kelly, who is serving a 30-year prison sentence for his conviction in a New York this year on federal charges alleging he used his fame to sexually abuse fans, is standing trial in his hometown of Chicago on several other federal charges. Among the most serious is conspiracy to obstruct justice by allegedly rigging a 2008 trial on state child pornography charges stemming from a purported video of him and Jane having sex when she was underage.
Prosecutors say Kelly paid off and threatened Jane to ensure that she didn’t testify at that trial. She didn’t, and he was ultimately acquitted.
Kelly is also standing trial on charges of producing child pornography and enticing minors for sex.
Unlike at the 2008 trial, Jane cooperated with prosecutors leading up to the current trial and is a pivotal witness.
During opening statements Wednesday, prosecutor Jason Julien sought to prepare jurors for the testimony of accusers including Jane, reminding them that a core issue at trial remained the exploitation of often scared and confused children — even though the accusers who would speak to jurors are now grown adults.
Speaking softly and tentatively when she first took the stand Thursday, Jane described her upbringing in a musical family in a Chicago suburb, including that she was home-schooled because she was in a touring musical group that she joined when she was about 12.
Jane first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer who worked with Kelly. Soon after that meeting, Jane told her parents that Kelly was going to be her godfather.
As her testimony continued, Jane sounded calmer and steadier, answering questions matter-of-factly.
Prosecutors have said Kelly shot the video of Jane in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home between 1998 and 2000. In it, the girl is heard calling the man “daddy.” Federal prosecutors say that she and Kelly had sex hundreds of times over the years in his homes, recording studios and tour buses.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it, and so prosecutors say he conspired to fix that trial.
According to prosecutors, Kelly told the parents and Jane to leave Chicago, paying for them to travel to the Bahamas and Cancun, Mexico. When they returned, prosecutors say Kelly sought to isolate Jane, moving her around to different hotels. When called before a state grand jury looking into the video, Jane, her father and mother denied it was her in it.
Tears streamed down his faced on June 13, 2008, when he was acquitted on all counts of child pornography. Some of the jurors told reporters after the trial that they weren’t convinced that the female in the video was who state prosecutors said she was.
Before the 2008 trial, Kelly carried a duffle bag full of sex tapes everywhere he went for years, but some tapes later went missing, according to court filings. In the 2000s, bootleg copies of some videos appeared on street corners throughout the U.S.
In the early 2000s, the aunt showed the parents a copy of a video she said depicted their daughter having sex with Kelly. When they confronted Kelly, he told them, “You’re with me or against me,” a government filing says.
The parents took it as a threat.
Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behavior. The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly also faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.
Prosecutors told jurors that the evidence includes at least three videos showing Kelly having sex with underage girls.
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.

Jurors at R Kelly trial set to see video of singer allegedly having sex with child after he ‘paid witnesses to keep quiet’,"Jurors at the R Kelly trial are set to see a graphic video of the disgraced R&B singer allegedly “having sex with a minor” after the court heard he recorded many of the alleged assaults on VHS tapes.
The singer then paid people who knew about the recordings to keep quiet, when he faced criminal charges of child pornography in 2008, prosecutors have told the start of Kelly’s federal trial.

Prosecutors told jurors during opening statements on Wednesday that Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, had a “dark side” and kept a “hidden world” behind his fame and status.
“Robert Kelly had sex with multiple children. He made videotapes having sex with multiple children,” US Assistant Attorney Jason Julien told the US District Court in Illinois.
Kelly’s alleged victims were as young as 14, he said, adding there were “multiple girls, hundreds of times”.
“This trial is not complicated in terms of what the issues are,” Julien said.

Kelly, 55, who appeared in court wearing a navy suit, blue shirt and blue tie, is on trial on charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice.
This trial, in his hometown of Chicago, comes almost two months after he was convicted and handed a 30-year prison sentence in New York City on charges of federal racketeering and sex trafficking.
Kelly is being tried alongside his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and associate, Milton “June” Brown.
Both are accused of conspiring with the singer to intimidate and bribe witnesses and cover up evidence in a 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges, which involved a video recording of him allegedly sexually abusing a minor.
During the opening statements, Julien said McDavid and Brown were part of Kelly’s “tight inner circle” and helped him cover up his abuse.

Julien said that included going to “extraordinary lengths” to help him retrieve a recording of the singer having sex with a minor after the tape went missing.
The chief charge against Kelly and his associates is that they conspired to rig the 2008 trial.
That trial centered on a 26-minute videotape sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times in 2002 that allegedly showed Kelly performing sex acts with an underage girl.
He was acquitted in that case after the girl who purportedly appeared in the tape refused to testify.
Jurors at the time said that made it difficult for them to convict Kelly.
On Wednesday, Julien said the person who appeared in that video with Kelly, and who would be referred to as Jane during this trial, would testify.

She was victimised by Kelly when she was 14 and the singer was 31, Julien said.
He said Kelly recorded himself having sex with Jane using a camcorder in several videos where it was clear he knew her age.
After Kelly and his associates became aware that a videotape went public, he used his fame to push Jane and her family into not testifying or cooperating with law enforcement, Julien said.
Jane, now 37, and her parents would testify in this trial about the alleged sexual abuse, Julien said, as would several other alleged victims.

“Jane is going to testify it’s her on the videos, that it’s Kelly having sex with her,” he told jurors.
“Kelly had sex with Jane hundreds of time, at Kelly’s home, in his recording studio, on his tour bus and in hotels.
“Kelly told her they would get in a lot of trouble if anyone found out he was having sex with Jane.”
Jurors will also be shown several of the recordings Kelly allegedly made of himself engaging in sexual acts with minors.
“The videos are difficult to watch,” Julien said.
“But it’s important for you all to watch those videos to understand what happened.”

Woman tells court of frequent sex with R Kelly before she was 18,"A woman who has been central to R Kelly’s legal troubles for more than two decades has testified that the R&B singer had sex with her “hundreds” of times before she turned 18 years old, starting when she was just 15.
Jane — the pseudonym for the now 37-year-old woman at Kelly’s trial on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges — told jurors that in the late 1990s when she was 13, she asked the Grammy award-winning singer to be her godfather because she saw him as an inspiration and mentor.

She said he first touched her breasts and other parts of her body when she was around 14 at a Chicago recording studio, and that around that time, he “started penetration” at his home at his North Side Chicago home.

She told jurors she was 15 when they first had intercourse.
Asked by a prosecutor how she would know what to do sexually, Jane answered: “He would tell me what to do.”
Asked how many times they had sex before she turned 18, she answered quietly: “Uncountable times… hundreds.”",2022-08-17T23:00:00Z,https://www.breakingnews.ie,BreakingNews.ie

Aug. 17 (UPI) -- Prosecutors contend R. Kelly recorded multiple sexual encounters with underaged girls and then paid people who were aware of them not to talk, a federal courtroom was told on the opening day of his latest criminal trial Wednesday. The former R&B star, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is on trial in his home city of Chicago on child pornography and obstruction of justice charges stemming from 2008. Advertisement
He is accused of coercing five children into sex acts and creating child pornography between September 1998 and September 1999, according to court records.
Outlining their case on Wednesday, federal prosecutors say several people knew about the illegal VHS tapes but the Grammy Award winner paid them to keep quiet about his actions.
Prosecutors say he went so far as to pay for the family of one of his victims to leave the United States to remain silent. They also allege he had his employees conceal identity and connection to him or any recordings.
Kelly's accusers were all between the ages of 12 and 17 when they first met him, according to court documents. All five alleged victims are expected to testify at the trial, which will not be televised.

Prosecutors said Wednesday they will play three of four tapes for the jury, with one directly linked to the 2008 allegations. The others are believed to be related to other alleged victims.

Kelly, 55, was already found guilty in September in a Federal Court in Brooklyn.
He was convicted on all nine counts, including racketeering, the sexual exploitation of children, forced labor and transporting girls across state lines to engage in illegal sexual activity.
Also on Wednesday, Kelly's fiancée, Joycelyn Savage, said she is pregnant with the singer's baby.
Savage told Entertainment Tonight that she is five months pregnant.
Kelly's lawyers denied the pregnancy when contacted by the outlet.

R Kelly Chicago Trial Opened with Goddaughter Allegations,"Photo: Kamil Krzaczynski/REUTERS
When opening statements kicked off in R. Kelly’s Chicago federal-court trial on August 17, the prosecution quickly turned dark. Prosecutors started by making their main point — that the disgraced R&B superstar preyed on minors — and alleged that he even abused his own goddaughter. “The defendant, Robert Kelly, had sex with multiple children,” the Chicago Tribune quoted prosecutor Jason Julien as saying. “He made videotapes of himself having sex with children.” In this federal trial, Kelly’s second within one year, he faces child-pornography and obstruction-of-justice charges related to five accusers. Unlike Kelly’s Brooklyn case, in which he was convicted and sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment, two of his alleged co-conspirators, Derrel McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, are on trial right alongside him.
McDavid and Brown allegedly tried to hide Kelly’s crimes and help him beat his 2008 child-pornography trial in Chicago, which concluded with the singer’s shocking acquittal. Some of the purported cover-up efforts included coordinating payouts to accusers as well as a would-be whistleblower. Julien reportedly argued that McDavid and Brown were well aware of Kelly’s crimes. Kelly, the Tribune quoted Julien as saying, “had another side, a hidden side, a dark side, that he — with the help of McDavid and Brown — did not allow the world to see.”
The prosecution provided harrowing details about Kelly’s alleged abuse of minors. Julien claimed that Kelly sexually abused Kelly’s own goddaughter, “Jane.” The Tribune reported that the jury would see portions of videotapes showing this abuse and that Kelly described Jane as having a “14-year-old” figure in these recordings. (A note on the use of alleged and allegedly in the context of this trial: Kelly was convicted in his New York case of one set of crimes; since he pleaded not guilty to the Chicago charges and is presumed innocent — and hasn’t been found guilty there — prosecutors’ statements are still allegations.) Julien referred to the accusers in this case with pseudonyms, Jane, Tracy, Nia, Brittany and Pinky, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. “They’re going to tell you what happened to them,” Julien reportedly said of the recordings. “The videos are difficult to watch … but it’s important for you all to watch those videos to understand what happened.” Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, told jurors to weigh whether he was a victim “of financial exploitation, extortion.” Bonjean reportedly argued: “There are strong motivators out there,” she told the jury. “The government’s case really does hinge on the testimony of liars, extortionists, people who engaged in the business of trafficking pornography.” McDavid’s lawyer, Vadim Glozman, said that his client acted in keeping with Kelly’s legal and investigative team; these were people who wouldn’t be suspected of trying to cover up a crime. Glozman claimed that McDavid thought the child-pornography tape in Kelly’s 2008 case wasn’t real. “Because he believed that, there was never any intention to obstruct justice,” Glozman argued, per the Tribune.
According to the Sun-Times, “The crowds of supporters that attended Kelly’s 2008 trial in Chicago have been absent during the two days of jury selection” earlier in the week. Testimony started today after opening statements.",2022-08-17T22:18:09Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
R. Kelly Lawyer to Chicago Trial Jurors: Reject ‘Mob Justice’,"R. Kelly kept an ugly side of his life hidden as he escaped poverty in Chicago and rose to pop music stardom, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday at the singer’s trial on charges accusing him of enticing girls for sex and rigging a 2008 child pornography case.

Kelly’s lead attorney implored jurors during her opening statement at the federal trial in Chicago not to accept what she said was the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster.”

Going back to the 1990s, much of the world knew Kelly solely by his hit songs, including the chart-topping inspirational anthem “I Believe I Can Fly,” U.S. Assistant Attorney Jason Julien said. But “Kelly had another side … a hidden side, a dark side,” he added. “This trial is about Kelly’s hidden side.”
Kelly, 55, faces multiple charges, including enticing of minors for sex, producing child pornography and rigging his 2008 child pornography trial at which he was acquitted. Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behavior. The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” that detailed sex abuse allegations involving women and teenage girls.
Defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean told jurors that Kelly, in part because of intellectual challenges that included illiteracy, was forced to rely on others as his career took off and that he was sometimes led astray by those in his circle of associates.
“Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,” she said.
A conviction in Chicago could add decades to a 30-year prison sentence he already received from a New York federal judge for charges that he used his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Sitting at a defense table as the prosecutor spoke, Kelly occasionally shook his head as Julien described Kelly manipulating and controlling girls — even beating them if they didn’t comply with strict rules that included calling him “daddy.”
Julien sought to give jurors a sense of the scale of Kelly’s alleged exploitation, saying he “repeatedly” had sex with girls who were just 14, 15 and 16 years old — “multiple girls, hundreds of times.”
He told jurors that the evidence includes at least three videos showing Kelly having sex with underage girls.
“We’re not going to play hours of child pornography and make you watch it,” the prosecutor said, explaining they would see excerpts. He added: “The videos are difficult to watch. But it is important to watch … to understand what happened.”
Kelly nodded his head in agreement when his lawyer told jurors Kelly isn’t looking for special treatment — just a fair trial.
“When the government wants to paint him as a monster … you remember we are talking about a human being,” Bonjean said.
She said jurors should not succumb to what she called “a mob justice climate” surrounding Kelly, alluding to “Surviving R. Kelly” and years of harsh social media accounts of him.
“It is true that Mr. Kelly is imperfect,” she said. “On his journey from poverty to stardom, he stumbled along the way.” But, she said, she was confident jurors would ultimately find him not guilty.
After jurors acquitted Kelly at his state trial in 2008, some later explained that they felt they had no choice because the girl did not testify. The woman, now in her 30s and referred to in court filings as “Minor 1,” will be the government’s star witness. During the trial, she will be referred to by a single pseudonym, “Jane,” in court. She’s expected to testify that she was on video having sex with Kelly.
A central focus will be whether Kelly threatened and paid off Minor 1. That’s the allegation underpinning one of the charges against Kelly, conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Kelly also faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.
The jury was impaneled Tuesday night with prosecutors and defense attorneys arguing toward the end of the process about whether the government was improperly attempting to keep some Black people off the jury. Kelly is Black.
About half the 12 jurors impaneled were identified as Black by the judge, prosecutor and defense attorneys. There are also five alternates.",2022-08-17T21:00:58Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
"R Kelly's child pornography trial 'about his dark and hidden side', prosecutors say","R Kelly's trial on allegations he made child pornography and enticed underage girls for sex is about his ""dark"" and ""hidden"" side, prosecutors have said.
The R&B singer is also charged with rigging his 2008 child pornography trial at federal court in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois.
US assistant attorney Jason Julien sought to give the jury a sense of Kelly's alleged exploitation on Wednesday, saying he ""repeatedly"" had sex with girls who were just 14, 15 and 16-years-old.
He told the court the ""I Believe I Can Fly"" singer had sex with ""multiple girls, hundreds of times"".
R Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June for using his fame to sexually abuse young fans.
The 55-year-old is now on trial accused of enticing minors for sex, producing child pornography, and of fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial at which he was acquitted.
A focus of the trial will be on whether Kelly threatened and paid off a girl with whom he allegedly videotaped himself having sex when he was about 30, and she was no older than 14.
The allegation underpins another of the charges against Kelly: conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Jurors in the 2008 child pornography trial acquitted Kelly, with some later explaining that they felt they had no choice because the girl did not give evidence.

The woman, now in her 30s and referred to in court filings only as Minor 1, will be the government's star witness.
When she gives evidence, prosecutors explained, they will not use her real name, nor refer to her as Minor 1. Instead, they will call her by a single pseudonym: Jane.
She is expected to give evidence that she was on video having sex with Kelly. The recording was at the heart of the month-long 2008 trial and was played for jurors almost every day.

As both sides began exercising peremptory challenges - in which they can remove a fixed number of potential jurors from the pool - one of Kelly's lawyers accused prosecutors of seeking to strike black people from the jury to ""deny Mr Kelly a jury of his peers"".
Prosecutors noted many African American people had already made it on to the jury before the defence objected, and they argued their reasons for wanting to strike some had nothing to do with race.
In one case, they said an older man appeared to have a hard time staying awake.
Judge Harry Leinenweber partially agreed with the defence, disallowing prosecutors from striking three black people from the jury, and restoring them.
About half the 12 jurors enlisted were identified as black by the judge, prosecutor, and defence attorneys. Six alternates were also selected.

Opening Statements in R. Kelly’s Chicago Federal Trial Begin,"R. Kelly is currently on trial in Chicago for child pornography and obstruction charges. The trial’s opening statements began today (August 17), following 12 hours of jury selection on Tuesday, with the prosecution team delivering the first statement, WGNTV and the Chicago Tribune report. “The defendant, Robert Kelly, had sex with multiple children,” Assistant United States Attorney Jason Julien reportedly said in the prosecution’s opening statement. “He made videotapes of himself having sex with children. And these two co-defendants, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, knew about it.”
Prosecutors claim that Kelly and his former employees, McDavid and Brown, paid off victims and witnesses in the singer’s 2008 child pornography trial. The three men have pleaded not guilty to the allegations.
The prosecution’s opening statement mentioned Kelly’s 2008 trial. In the earlier trial, Kelly was acquitted after being accused of filming a sex tape with an underage woman who later refused to testify in court. Prosecutors say that the woman and her parents will testify in the new trial, as The Associated Press notes.
In her opening statement, according to the Tribune, Kelly’s lead attorney Jennifer Bonjean said, “[Prosecutors] believe their evidence is going to show that he is a serial child sexual abuser. That’s what they believe.” She continued, “And it is true that Mr. Kelly is imperfect. It is true that on his journey from poverty to stardom that he stumbled along the way. It is important when the government wants to paint him as a monster that you remember we are talking about a human being. We implore you to keep those emotions in check.”

Jurors to be shown video of R . Kelly having sex with minor: prosecutors,"Disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly videotaped himself having sex with multiple children — including in vile footage where he repeatedly referred to his goddaughter’s “14-year-old” anatomy, prosecutors alleged Wednesday in opening statements of his federal trial in Chicago.
Jurors are expected to see parts of three videotapes allegedly depicting Kelly having sexual contact with his then-14-year-old goddaughter, Jane, over the course of the trial, Assistant US Attorney Jason Julien told the court.
“The defendant, Robert Kelly, had sex with multiple children,” Julien said. “He made videotapes of himself having sex with children.”

The prosecutor described the Grammy-winning superstar as a serial predator who had sex hundreds of times with minors and went to “extraordinary lengths” to cover it up, according to the Chicago Tribune.
Another videotape allegedly showing child porn will not be played for jurors because Kelly and and his co-defendants, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, allegedly covered it up, but witnesses will testify about it, Julien said.
Julien told jurors the “I Believe I can Fly” singer had “a hidden side, a dark side, that he — with the help of McDavid and Brown — did not allow the world to see.”
“This trial is about Kelly’s hidden side,” Julien said.

“It is true that Mr. Kelly is imperfect,” she said. “On his journey from poverty to stardom, he stumbled along the way.”

Kelly, 55, was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison in June after his conviction in Brooklyn federal court on nine counts, including racketeering and violations of the Mann Act.
A host of victims testified at the 2021 trial, where prosecutors painted Kelly as a “predator” who preyed on his young fans and sexually abused them for decades.

"R. Kelly's Chicago Trial: Opening Statements Mention Sex With Kids, 2008 Tape","The latest development in R. Kelly's legal saga surrounds today's opening statements in his Chicago federal trial. The R&B singer is facing charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice relating to a 2008 case of a similar nature involving five victims.
Today, the court heard the case's opening statements from the defendant and plaintiff, just a few days after his manager was convicted for threatening a screening of Surviving R. Kelly.

Prosecutors began the hearing with the following: ""The defendant, Robert Kelly, had sex with multiple children. He made videotapes of himself having sex with children."" The prosecutor also pointed to two of Kelly's co-defendants, ex-associates who allegedly knew of his crimes and helped cover them up.
The prosecution's opening statements also mentioned ""Jane,"" the main accuser from the 2008 case that was allegedly videotaped multiple times having encounters with the R&B singer at the age of 14. They also confirmed Jane will testify in this case. According to the prosecution, Kelly engaged in various methods to keep Jane and her family quiet, including flying them out of the country and having his employees hide their identity or any connection to the individuals.
Four videotapes are being considered in this trial, and the jury will watch three of them, according to the prosecutors. At least one tape pertains directly to Jane, while the others could implicate more victims. Prosecutors accused Kelly of taking advantage of at least four minors and tampering with the 2008 trial that resulted in his acquittal.
Jennifer Bonjean, R. Kelly's legal representative, said the singer is the victim of persecution driven by mob mentality -- a mob that has come far too late to paint him as a monster when he was tried for these crimes. She labeled the accusers as ""criminals"" who, in their attempt to extort Kelly, have also secured immunity deals with the prosecutors. There is also a tape that prosecutors have referenced but refuse to play, which Bonjean has claimed does not exist. Kelly's representative is also leaning heavily on Jane Doe's past statements that she is not on tape with the singer.
Bonjean has called her client ""imperfect"" but innocent. R. Kelly has already been convicted of federal sex crimes in New York and has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.

"R. Kelly sexually assaulted minors and paid witnesses to cover up evidence, prosecutors say as his trial begins","CHICAGO — The disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly had sex with minors on numerous occasions, recorded many of the alleged assaults to VHS tapes and then paid people who knew about the recordings to keep quiet when he faced criminal charges of child pornography in 2008, jurors were told Wednesday as his federal trial began.
Prosecutors said during opening statements that Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, had a ""dark side"" and kept a ""hidden world"" behind his fame and status.
“Robert Kelly had sex with multiple children. He made videotapes having sex with multiple children,” U.S. Assistant Attorney Jason Julien said in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
Kelly's alleged victims were as young as 14, he said, adding that there were “multiple girls, hundreds of times.”
""This trial is not complicated in terms of what the issues are,"" Julien said.
Kelly, 55, who appeared in court Wednesday wearing a navy suit, a blue shirt and a blue tie, is on trial on charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice.
This trial, in his hometown of Chicago, comes almost two months after he was convicted and handed a 30-year prison sentence in New York City on charges of federal racketeering and sex trafficking.
Kelly is being tried alongside his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and associate, Milton “June” Brown, who are both accused of conspiring with him to intimidate and bribe witnesses and cover up evidence in a 2008 criminal trial on child pornography charges in Cook County, which involved a video recording of him allegedly sexually abusing a minor.
During the opening statements, Julien said McDavid and Brown were part of Kelly’s “tight inner circle” and helped him cover up his abuse, including going to “extraordinary lengths” to help him retrieve a recording of the singer having sex with a minor after the tape went missing.
The chief charge against Kelly and his associates is that they conspired to rig the 2008 trial. That trial centered on a 26-minute videotape sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times in 2002 that allegedly showed Kelly performing sex acts with an underage girl. NBC News has not viewed the videotape. He was acquitted in that case after the girl who purportedly appeared in the tape refused to testify at the trial. Jurors at the time said that made it difficult for them to convict Kelly.
On Wednesday, Julien said the person who appeared in that video with Kelly and who will be referred to as Jane during this trial, will testify.
She was victimized by Kelly when she was 14 years old and the singer was 31, Julien said. He said Kelly recorded himself having sex with Jane using a camcorder in several videos where it was clear he knew her age.
After Kelly and his associates became aware that a videotape went public, he used his fame to push Jane and her family into not testifying or cooperating with law enforcement, Julien said.
Jane, now 37, and her parents will testify in this trial about the alleged sexual abuse, Julien said, as will several other alleged victims.
""Jane is going to testify it’s her on the videos, that it’s Kelly having sex with her. Kelly had sex with Jane hundreds of time, at Kelly’s home, in his recording studio, on his tour bus and in hotels,"" he told jurors. ""Kelly told her they would get in a lot of trouble if anyone found out he was having sex with Jane.""
Jurors also will be shown several of the recordings Kelly allegedly made of himself engaging in sexual acts with minors.
""The videos are difficult to watch,"" Julien said. ""But it’s important for you all to watch those videos to understand what happened.""
Jennifer Bonjean, Kelly’s attorney, said during her opening statements that despite the singer being depicted as a “monster,” the jury will have to decide whether they believe the accusers and witnesses to be credible.
“It is true that Mr. Kelly is imperfect,” she said and that on “his journey from poverty to stardom, he stumbled along the way.”
Bonjean said the law does not allow jurors to decide if Kelly is a “bad guy,” but whether he committed the alleged offenses for which he is on trial.
“We try counts, offenses, not people’s character,” she said.
""You’ll have to decide whether you believe these people,"" Bonjean said. ""You’ll have to decide whether they deserve any ounce of credibility.""
She also said that for 22 years, Jane “adamantly denied” that it was her in the video allegedly depicting her and Kelly having sex and that her parents had denied it, as well.
Derrel McDavid’s attorney, Vadim Glozman, said Wednesday afternoon that his client “had every reason to believe” Kelly when he denied the allegations against him.
He said McDavid should not be held criminally liable because Kelly never told them the truth and his client “had no reason to doubt” him.
Referring to the 2008 trial, Glozman said Kelly was found not guilty and that, “no one, based on the information at that time, thought any different.”
Kathleen Leon, an attorney for Milton Brown, described him as ""just an assistant, who day-in and day-out fulfilled his duties” and had “no knowledge of any conspiracy” or that “the individual portrayed in the VHS tape was a minor.”
Jurors appeared attentive during opening statements, with two seeming to take vigorous notes.
Following opening statements, jurors heard from the prosecution's first witness, Dr. Darrel Turner, a clinical psychologist who specializes in sexual abuse and sexual offending. He described methods of ""grooming,"" including isolation and showing favoritism and testified that a ""power differential makes the grooming process smoother.""
The courtroom was filled to capacity Wednesday, with several people directed to an overflow room. Those in the courtroom included many who said they were members of Kelly’s family and were there to support him. There were, however, no supporters or protesters outside the courthouse Wednesday morning.
Before the opening statements began, Kelly’s attorney objected to the use of pseudonyms for witnesses, specifically the parents of women who were minors at the time of Kelly's alleged abuse. McDavid's attorney joined the objection, arguing that the use of pseudonyms during cross examination will “confuse witnesses” such as law enforcement and may “complicate” the process. Prosecutors, however, argued that revealing the real names of those individuals would, in turn, reveal the identity of their children.
The judge did not rule on the objection.

"'I Performed As R. Kelly for Years, I Have No Regrets'","I've been singing as my main career for about 30 years. I live in England but my work has taken me all round the world. I've done gigs in nightclubs in Cannes, Barcelona and Portugal, I've had residencies in hotels in Dubai, and I've performed at golf clubs in Abu Dhabi.
I tend to sing soul and Motown music, although I'll sometimes throw in some reggae or even rockier tracks, depending on where I'm performing. My job is to get people on the dance floor.
But eight years ago, an acquaintance suggested I get involved in the tribute market. They were a Michael Jackson tribute, and they said they were making a killing.
So, I decided to start performing as R. Kelly, alongside my other gigs. I thought he was an artist with a great catalog, and my look seemed to work reasonably well for the act. Plus, I didn't know of any other R. Kelly tributes, so I saw a gap in the market.
Even when I started out, there was some controversy around R. Kelly. I realized this when I first performed my tribute act, in 2015, at a golf club in Abu Dhabi. I was performing with four other tributes—Madonna, Cher, Lionel Richie and Tina Turner—at what was being billed as The Concert That Never Happened. As part of its promotion, I was interviewed by a journalist for a local magazine. They asked me why I'd chosen R. Kelly, and whether I was concerned about the rumors.
At that point, there had been no trial or verdict that I was aware of, although Tiffany Hawkins had sued R. Kelly and won compensation in 1998. To me, it was just rumors. There had been aspersions about many different performers, as I told the journalist at the time, and I had chosen R. Kelly because he was an artist with a great number of hits.
Over the next couple of years, I performed between 10 and 15 times, usually at nightclubs and restaurants.
I found the set a refreshing break from my usual routine. When you perform covers of songs, there's a set of classics that you tend to perform every night. They always go down well, but the repetitive nature means it doesn't feel fresh to you as the performer. You can lose the love of a great song, like Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition,"" because of it.
When I performed as R. Kelly, on the other hand, I was performing songs I liked, and bringing back some of that retro '80s, '90s vibe.
Another big difference was that when you're doing a whole range of song covers, you almost become a jukebox. When you have a tribute act, on the other hand, people come along to watch you perform because they actually want to hear the songs. As a performer, it's the closest feeling to being R. Kelly, George Michael or any other famous singer. There's something quite appealing about that.
The audience reaction was always positive. There would be situations, such as hen parties flirting with me; I'd just ham it up in jest and incorporate it into the act. At the time, R. Kelly's image was of him being a ""ladies' man,"" so as a performer there was an expectation that I would emanate that. It was just a bit of fun.
Of course, I didn't realize the ominous side to R. Kelly's ""ladies' man"" image. When I had been performing for over a year, the rumors were getting louder. Nobody ever challenged me, and there was no rage from anyone in the audience, but a few of my associates asked, ""Are you sure you should be doing this act?""
I watched the first documentary, R. Kelly: Sex, Girls and Videotapes, five years ago and made up my own mind. Even seeing the lowest level of misogyny—the ""lad culture""—was abhorrent to me. It was obvious that something seriously wrong had happened, and it had affected many women. I have a daughter and three sisters and I respect women. I didn't want to condone or promote anyone who I thought was guilty of violence, bullying or misogyny, so I decided to give up the act.
Even though I no longer do the tribute act, I still occasionally perform R. Kelly's songs. As with Michael Jackson, there is still that question hanging over me about whether I should do so. But if I sing ""Remix to Ignition,"" as part of my set, it always goes down really well. Before I sing it, I usually say, ""I know there's a bit of controversy here,"" and I address the elephant in the room.
I wouldn't do a tribute act again, as it's not the reason I got into music. Now, I've moved more towards corporate gigs, with a seven or eight-piece live band, and that's what I enjoy more than anything.
Yet I have no regrets. It was an interesting act to perform, and I've taken away some valuable lessons in how the entertainment industry works. It was a learning curve.

Happy Anniversary to Kelly Rowland Texting Nelly on a Spreadsheet,"Happy Anniversary to Kelly Rowland Texting Nelly on a Spreadsheet
Fresh off the heels of “Hot in Herre,” Nelly blessed the public with yet another hit: “Dilemma.” The R&B song was released in June 2002 and features Kelly Rowland as a woman smitten with Nelly despite being in a relationship with someone else. The song is a staple in Y2K music culture, and today is actually a special anniversary — 20 years ago, the song reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first of ten weeks.
“But Kevin,” I hear you say, “What does this have to do with tech?” This is a valid question, since Gizmodo is a tech-focused website after all. Well, may I please direct your attention to the music video for Dilemma?
It’s a typical will-they-wont-they plot, until Kelly Rowland does the unimaginable. In a bid to generate an open and healthy line of communication with Nelly, Rowland opts to send a simple text. “WHERE YOU AT? HOLLA WHEN YOU GET THIS” Rowland types into her cell phone’s spreadsheet app. Rowland is then visibly distraught that Nelly is ghosting her, despite the fact that he 1) could not actually receive her spreadsheet text message and 2) is standing right outside her window.
Rowland is using a Nokia 9210 Communicator, which was an early smartphone that could flip open lengthwise to reveal a full keyboard and a colour screen. Other, similar cell phones released around that time include the LG enV and the T-Mobile Sidekick. It’s not supremely clear if Rowland is using Microsoft Excel, or the Communicator’s built-in spreadsheet app, but Nelly explained in a 2016 interview with Australia’s The Project that texting via spreadsheet “was the thing at the time.” I simply do not believe him, and a brief poll of those in our newsroom with cell phones in 2002 lends credibility that this doesn’t appear to have been “the thing at the time.”
The music video for the song is a testament to the kitschy production choices made in early 2000’s music videos, but this particular moment will live in our hearts forever as a reminder of open and honest communication — maybe on Google Sheets this time?",2022-08-17T17:00:00Z,https://www.gizmodo.com.au,Gizmodo Australia
Prosecutor: R. Kelly trial about singer's 'hidden' side,"Michael Tarm And Don Babwin, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - R. Kelly kept an ugly side of his life hidden as he escaped poverty in Chicago and rose to pop music stardom, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday at the singer's trial on charges accusing him of enticing girls for sex and rigging a 2008 child pornography case.
Kelly's lead attorney implored jurors during her opening statement at the federal trial in Chicago not to accept what she said was the prosecution's portrayal of her client as “a monster.”
Going back to the 1990s, much of the world knew Kelly solely by his hit songs, including the chart-topping inspirational anthem “I Believe I Can Fly,” U.S. Assistant Attorney Jason Julien said. But “Kelly had another side â€¦ a hidden side, a dark side,” he added. “This trial is about Kelly's hidden side.”
Kelly, 55, faces multiple charges, including enticing of minors for sex, producing child pornography and rigging his 2008 child pornography trial at which he was acquitted.
Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behavior. The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” that detailed sex abuse allegations involving women and teenage girls.
Defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean told jurors that Kelly, in part because of intellectual challenges that included illiteracy, was forced to rely on others as his career took off and that he was sometimes led astray by those in his circle of associates.
“Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,” she said.
A conviction in Chicago could add decades to a 30-year prison sentence he already received from a New York federal judge for charges that he used his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Sitting at a defense table as the prosecutor spoke, Kelly occasionally shook his head as Julien described Kelly manipulating and controlling girls - even beating them if they didn't comply with strict rules that included calling him “daddy.”
Julien sought to give jurors a sense of the scale of Kelly's alleged exploitation, saying he “repeatedly” had sex with girls who were just 14, 15 and 16 years old - “multiple girls, hundreds of times.”
He told jurors that the evidence includes at least three videos showing Kelly having sex with underage girls.
“We're not going to play hours of child pornography and make you watch it,” the prosecutor said, explaining they would see excerpts. He added: “The videos are difficult to watch. But it is important to watch ... to understand what happened.”
Later Wednesday, prosecutors entered into evidence video that was at the center of Kelly's 2008 trial, but did not play any of it for jurors before court ended for the day. Prosecutors contend the video Kelly having sex with a girl no older than 14 when he was around 30.
Kelly nodded his head in agreement when his lawyer told jurors Kelly isn't looking for special treatment - just a fair trial.
“When the government wants to paint him as a monster â€¦ you remember we are talking about a human being,” Bonjean said.
She said jurors should not succumb to what she called “a mob justice climate” surrounding Kelly, alluding to “Surviving R. Kelly” and years of harsh social media accounts of him.
“It is true that Mr. Kelly is imperfect,” she said. “On his journey from poverty to stardom, he stumbled along the way.” But, she said, she was confident jurors would ultimately find him not guilty.
After jurors acquitted Kelly at his state trial in 2008, some later explained that they felt they had no choice because the girl did not testify. The woman, now 37 and referred to in court filings as “Minor 1,” will be the government's star witness. During the trial, she will be referred to by a single pseudonym, “Jane,” in court.
The first people to testify were a psychologist, a music executive and a former Chicago police detective who first obtained the video of Minor 1 in the early 2000s. The detective was expected to resume his testimony Thursday morning. At one point during Wednesday's testimony, prosecutors played about a minute of “I Believe I Can Fly” as they sought to establish how popular Kelly was in the the '90s heading into the 2000s.
A central focus of the trial will be whether Kelly threatened and paid off Minor 1. That's the allegation underpinning one of the charges against Kelly, conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Kelly also faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex - one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.
The jury was impaneled Tuesday night with prosecutors and defense attorneys arguing toward the end of the process about whether the government was improperly attempting to keep some Black people off the jury. Kelly is Black.
About half the 12 jurors impaneled were identified as Black by the judge, prosecutor and defense attorneys. There are also five alternates.",2022-08-17T12:34:00Z,https://www.cp24.com,CP24 Toronto

CHICAGO (AP) — Opening statements set for Wednesday give prosecutors and R. Kelly’s attorneys their first chance to address jurors directly about charges that accuse the R&B singer of enticing of minors for sex, producing child pornography and rigging his 2008 pornography trial.
Both the prosecution and Kelly’s legal team told the judge earlier in the week that they would like about an hour each to tell jurors about the kind evidence they can expect to see and hear. The evidentiary stage of the federal trial is expected to last about a month.
Lawyers for two Kelly co-defendants will also address jurors before the government begins calling witnesses later Wednesday. Prosecutors haven’t said who they will call first.

The jury was impaneled Tuesday night with prosecutors and defense attorneys arguing toward the end of the process about whether the government was improperly attempting to keep some Black people off the jury.
Kelly, who is Black, is accused of enticing minors for sex, of producing child pornography and of fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial at which he was acquitted.
As the sides began exercising peremptory challenges — in which they can remove a fixed number of potential jurors from the pool — Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean accused prosecutors of seeking to strike Black people from the jury “to deny Mr. Kelly a jury of his peers.”
Prosecutors noted multiple African American people had already made it onto the jury before the defense objected, and they argued their reasons for wanting to strike some had nothing to do with race. In one case, they said an older man appeared to have a hard time staying awake.
Judge Harry Leinenweber partially agreed with the defense, disallowing prosecutors from striking three Black people from the jury, and restoring them. About half the 12 jurors impaneled were identified as Black by the judge, prosecutor and defense attorneys. Six alternates were also selected.
Some of the jurors selected had watched at least part of a six-part documentary series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” about sex abuse allegations against the Grammy award-winning singer. Watching it wasn’t an automatic disqualification as long as a would-be juror could assure Leinenweber they could still be impartial.

Among the 12 jurors selected was a retired real estate agent who had one son who was a prosecutor and another son who was a defense attorney. Another juror was a librarian.
Among those dismissed was a woman who said she had unfavorable views of police and judges and a man who said he didn’t think the IRS should exist.
One central focus of the trial will be on whether Kelly threatened and paid off a girl with whom he allegedly videotaped himself having sex when he was about 30 and she was no older than 14. That’s the allegation underpinning another of the charges against Kelly, conspiracy to obstruct justice.

"R. Kelly trial about singer’s ‘hidden’ side, prosecutor tells court","R. Kelly kept an ugly side of his life hidden as he escaped poverty in Chicago and rose to pop music stardom, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday at the singer’s trial on charges accusing him of enticing girls for sex and rigging a 2008 child pornography case.
Kelly’s lead attorney implored jurors during her opening statement at the federal trial in Chicago not to accept what she said was the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster.”
Going back to the 1990s, much of the world knew Kelly solely by his hit songs, including the chart-topping inspirational anthem “I Believe I Can Fly,” U.S. Assistant Attorney Jason Julien said. But “Kelly had another side a hidden side, a dark side,” he added. “This trial is about Kelly’s hidden side.”
Kelly, 55, faces multiple charges, including enticing of minors for sex, producing child pornography and rigging his 2008 child pornography trial at which he was acquitted. Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behaviour. The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary “Surviving R. Kelly” that detailed sex abuse allegations involving women and teenage girls.
Defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean told jurors that Kelly, in part because of intellectual challenges that included illiteracy, was forced to rely on others as his career took off and that he was sometimes led astray by those in his circle of associates.
“Mr. Kelly can also be a victim,” she said.
A conviction in Chicago could add decades to a 30-year prison sentence he already received from a New York federal judge for charges that he used his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Sitting at a defence table as the prosecutor spoke, Kelly occasionally shook his head as Julien described Kelly manipulating and controlling girls – even beating them if they didn’t comply with strict rules that included calling him “daddy.”
Julien sought to give jurors a sense of the scale of Kelly’s alleged exploitation, saying he “repeatedly” had sex with girls who were just 14, 15 and 16 years old – “multiple girls, hundreds of times.”
He told jurors that the evidence includes at least three videos showing Kelly having sex with underage girls.
“We’re not going to play hours of child pornography and make you watch it,” the prosecutor said, explaining they would see excerpts. He added: “The videos are difficult to watch. But it is important to watch … to understand what happened.”
Kelly nodded his head in agreement when his lawyer told jurors Kelly isn’t looking for special treatment – just a fair trial.
“When the government wants to paint him as a monster you remember we are talking about a human being,” Bonjean said.
She said jurors should not succumb to what she called “a mob justice climate” surrounding Kelly, alluding to “Surviving R. Kelly” and years of harsh social media accounts of him.
“It is true that Mr. Kelly is imperfect,” she said. “On his journey from poverty to stardom, he stumbled along the way.” But, she said, she was confident jurors would ultimately find him not guilty.
After jurors acquitted Kelly at his state trial in 2008, some later explained that they felt they had no choice because the girl did not testify. The woman, now in her 30s and referred to in court filings as “Minor 1,” will be the government’s star witness. During the trial, she will be referred to by a single pseudonym, “Jane,” in court. She’s expected to testify that she was on video having sex with Kelly.
A central focus will be whether Kelly threatened and paid off Minor 1. That’s the allegation underpinning one of the charges against Kelly, conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Kelly also faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex – one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.
The jury was impanelled Tuesday night with prosecutors and defence attorneys arguing toward the end of the process about whether the government was improperly attempting to keep some Black people off the jury. Kelly is Black.
About half the 12 jurors impanelled were identified as Black by the judge, prosecutor and defence attorneys. There are also five alternates.

Jury to hear opening statements at R Kelly trial in Chicago,"This is a carousel. Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate
CHICAGO (AP) — Opening statements set for Wednesday give prosecutors and R. Kelly's attorneys their first chance to address jurors directly about charges that accuse the R&B singer of enticing of minors for sex, producing child pornography and rigging his 2008 pornography trial.
Both the prosecution and Kelly's legal team told the judge earlier in the week that they would like about an hour each to tell jurors about the kind evidence they can expect to see and hear. The evidentiary stage of the trial is expect to last about a month.
Lawyers for two Kelly co-defendants will also address jurors before the government begins calling witnesses later Wednesday. Prosecutors haven't said who they will call first.
The jury was impaneled Tuesday night with prosecutors and defense attorneys arguing toward the end of the process about whether the government was improperly attempting to keep some Blacks off the jury.
Kelly, who is Black, is accused of enticing minors for sex, of producing child pornography and of fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial at which he was acquitted.
As the sides began exercising peremptory challenges — in which they can remove a fixed number of potential jurors from the pool — Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean accused prosecutors of seeking to strike Blacks “to deny Mr. Kelly a jury of his peers.”
Prosecutors noted multiple African Americans had already made it onto the jury before the defense objected, and they argued their reasons for wanting to strike some had nothing to do with race. In one case, they said one older man appeared to have a hard time staying awake.
Judge Harry Leinenweber partially agreed with the defense, disallowing prosecutors from striking three Blacks from the jury, and restoring them. About half the 12 jurors impaneled were identified as Black by the judge, prosecutor and defense attorneys.
Six alternates were also selected.
Some of the jurors selected had watched at least part of a six-part documentary series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” about sex abuse allegations against the Grammy award-winning singer. Watching it wasn’t an automatic disqualification as long as a would-be juror could assure Judge Leinenweber they could still be impartial.
Among the 12 jurors selected was a retired real estate agent who had one son who was a prosecutor and another son who was a defense attorney. Another juror was a librarian.
Among those dismissed was a woman who said she had unfavorable views of police and judges and a man who said he didn't think the IRS should exist.
One central focus of the trial will be on whether Kelly threatened and paid off a girl with whom he allegedly videotaped himself having sex when he was about 30 and she was no older than 14. That's the allegation underpinning another of the charges against Kelly, conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Jurors in the 2008 child pornography trial acquitted Kelly, with some later explaining that they felt they had no choice because the girl did not testify. The woman, now in her 30s and referred to in court filings only as “Minor 1,” will be the government’s star witness in the federal trial that's expected to last four weeks.
When she testifies, prosecutors explained in court Monday that they won’t use her real name and won't refer to her as Minor 1. Instead, they will call her by a single pseudonym, “Jane.” Kelly's lawyers suggested they could contest where some of his accusers were minors at the time Kelly is accused if video recording or enticing them,
Kelly, 55, already has already been sentenced by a New York federal judge to a 30-year prison term for a 2021 conviction on charges that he used his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, will be around 80 before qualifying for early release based on his sentence imposed in New York, which he is appealing. .
Kelly faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants at the Chicago trial. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.
Minor 1 is expected to testify that she was on video having sex with Kelly. The recording was at the heart of the monthlong 2008 trial and was played for jurors almost every day. Prosecutors say Kelly threatened and sought to pay off Minor 1 and her parents so they wouldn't testify in 2008. None of them did.

‘He Had A Dark Side’: Prosecutors Slam R. Kelly In Opening Statements Of Sex Abuse Case,"Topline
R. Kelly’s legal team addressed jurors for the first time in a federal trial on Wednesday — nearly two months after he was sentenced to 30 years in prison in a separate trial — over charges the disgraced R&B singer sexually abused minors and conspired to rig his 2008 child pornography trial.

Key Facts
Kelly, 55, faces 13 counts of coercing five underage women between the ages of 12 and 17 into sexual acts, as well as producing and receiving child pornography—the latest legal battle over allegations of sexual abuse of underage women dating back to the 1990s. During opening statements of the trial Wednesday, attorney Jennifer Bonjean, who represents Kelly, admitted the singer “stumbled along the way” from “poverty to stardom,” but attacked the federal government for ‘waiting over two decades” to bring the case forward, and is only doing so in a “mob justice climate.” Assistant U.S. Aattorney Jason Julien, speaking for the prosecution, told jurors the world knows Kelly by his music, but he “had another side, a hidden side, a dark side” that he “did not allow the world to see for years.” Kelly, whose real name is Robert Kelly, has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, including trafficking, producing sexual imagery of minors and creating a “sex cult” of underage women. Five women are expected to take the stand against Kelly in the proceedings in Chicago, including one witness who was allegedly involved in the creation of a sex tape when she was underaged and then allegedly paid off by Kelly to keep quiet when he faced trial over child pornography charges in 2008. The accuser, whom the Associated Press said will be the prosecution’s “star witness,” did not testify in the 2008 trial, and prosecutors now say Kelly and a former employee named Derrel McDavid attempted to obstruct the 2008 child pornography case by concealing evidence and paying off people with knowledge of the alleged incidents. Along with McDavid, another of Kelly’s former employees, Milton Brown, is also listed as a co-defendant, charged with receiving child pornography.
Key Background
Allegations of sexual abuse started nearly 30 years ago, when the Grammy-Award-winning singer was rising to international fame. The first lawsuit came in 1996, when his ex-wife Tiffany Hawkins alleged Kelly had sex with her five years earlier when she was 15 and he was 24. Kelly settled the suit for $250,000—the first of several settlements that would come over the next two decades from other women with similar claims. Kelly was charged with 21 counts of child pornography in 2002, but acquitted of all charges in 2008 and was not charged again until 2019 following multiple media reports and allegations against Kelly. In 2019, he was arrested after being charged with 18 counts of abuse stemming nearly two decades, including kidnapping women and distributing child pornography. He was convicted in 2021 on eight counts, including violation of the Mann Act—for taking women across state lines for sex—and racketeering, including sexual exploitation of children. A New York federal judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison in June, which would make Kelly 85 by the time of his release. Kelly is appealing that sentence.
Chief Critic
Bonjean, who represents Kelly, posted a tweet last week, saying it would be “difficult to find 12 people who can be fair given the media war on my client.” Three of the jurors, who are Black, were initially kept off the jury, but later restored after defense attorneys accused the government of denying them a spot based on their race.
Swhat To Watch For
The evidentiary phase of the trial is expected to last four weeks. Kelly also faces criminal charges in Minnesota.

Attorney: Don’t accept portrayal of R. Kelly as ‘monster’,"CHICAGO (AP) — R.

Later Wednesday, prosecutors entered into evidence video that was at the center of Kelly’s 2008 trial, but did not play any of it for jurors before court ended for the day. Prosecutors contend the video Kelly having sex with a girl no older than 14 when he was around 30.
Kelly nodded his head in agreement when his lawyer told jurors Kelly isn’t looking for special treatment — just a fair trial.

The first people to testify were a psychologist, a music executive and a former Chicago police detective who first obtained the video of Minor 1 in the early 2000s. The detective was expected to resume his testimony Thursday morning. At one point during Wednesday’s testimony, prosecutors played about a minute of “I Believe I Can Fly” as they sought to establish how popular Kelly was in the the ‘90s heading into the 2000s.

"R. Kelly’s ‘hidden side’ on trial in Chicago, feds say","R. Kelly’s federal trial on child sex charges began with prosecutors assailing the R&B superstar’s “hidden side” on Wednesday in Chicago.
The feds said most people knew Kelly for hits like “I Believe I Can Fly,” but he was abusing girls and women behind the scenes. That side of Kelly, 55, has become much more public in recent years following the “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary and his conviction in New York on nine racketeering counts for running a sex-abuse scheme for decades.

Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison for those convictions, but he still faces federal charges of enticing minors for sex, producing child pornography and bullying a potential witness at his 2008 child-pornography trial in Illinois.
The singer’s defense attorneys said the feds would try to paint Kelly as a “monster” and victim of “mob justice.”

“When the government wants to paint him as a monster … you remember we are talking about a human being,” lawyer Jennifer Bonjean told the jury.
Four women are expected to testify that Kelly enticed them for sex while they were minors. Kelly faces four counts in connection with those four women.
Though the four witnesses will be the central figures in this case, prosecutors spoke in their opening statements about the many girls and women who have accused Kelly of sexual abuse going back decades. They said Kelly raped “multiple girls, hundreds of times,” many of whom were between 14 and 16 years old.

The case will also revolve around allegations about the 2008 trial in which Kelly was acquitted on state charges of child pornography. That trial was centered around a video that showed Kelly having sex with a girl who was reportedly no older than 14.
Though prosecutors played the video repeatedly at trial, the girl, referred to in court documents as “Minor 1,” and her family members did not testify.

“Minor 1′s mother did not want to go up against Kelly’s power, money and influence by not following what he said,” federal prosecutors said in a court filing.
Kelly allegedly paid for the family to fly to the Bahamas and Mexico before isolating the girl in different hotels during the trial.
But this time could be different: “Minor 1,” now a woman in her 30s, plans to testify in federal court.

Federal prosecutors said Kelly and the girl had sex “hundreds of times” in a log cabin-themed room in the star’s home on the North Side of Chicago. They also said Kelly carried a duffel bag full of sex tapes around with him throughout the 2000s.
Two other men, both associated with Kelly, are charged in the case. Derrel McDavid is accused of helping Kelly bully the witness at his 2008 trial. Milton Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Both have pleaded not guilty.
The trial is expected to last about a month. Kelly’s New York trial took just as long.

Opening statements begin in second R. Kelly federal trial,"Jurors in R. Kelly’s federal child pornography trial had been told the evidence in the case would transport them back in time, but they probably didn’t think they’d find themselves watching the 1998 Grammy Awards.
“Every once in a while, a song comes along that touches us all in a way that is out of the ordinary,” actor Kelsey Grammer said on the snippet of the show played in court Wednesday. Then the curtain lifted, the camera zoomed in, and jurors saw Kelly at the height of his fame: 31 years old, flooded with blue spotlights, in front of a giant video of a soaring bald eagle.

Kelly’s memorable performance of “I Believe I Can Fly,” which won multiple Grammy Awards, was played by prosecutors to reinforce the image of him as a powerful superstar. At the time of the video, however, Kelly had allegedly been sexually assaulting his young goddaughter for two years, part of a pattern of sexual misconduct that has now landed him in court for a second federal trial.

As Kelly’s mellifluous tones filled the large ceremonial courtroom at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, his lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, seemed visibly pleased that the jury was hearing one of her client’s most recognized hits. She placed her hand on Kelly’s shoulder in solidarity as they watched.
But federal prosecutors said Kelly’s international stardom hid a dark side, one that the world would soon see.
“The defendant, Robert Kelly, had sex with multiple children,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Julien told the jury during his opening statements at the trial, where Kelly stands accused of conspiring with two former associates to cover up his sexual misdeeds. “He made videotapes of himself having sex with children. ... And he kept those videos close, because if the world found out that he was having sex with children, he’d be in a lot of trouble, and it would ruin his career.”
In her opening remarks, Bonjean urged jurors to consider whether Kelly might be a victim himself of financial exploitation and extortion by bad actors looking to capitalize on his fame.
“There are strong motivators out there,” she said. “The government’s case really does hinge on the testimony of liars, extortionists, people who engaged in the business of trafficking pornography.”
Kelly, 55, was indicted three years ago on charges of child pornography and conspiracy to obstruct justice, alleging he conspired to rig his 2008 Cook County trial by paying off his then-goddaughter after she was allegedly sexually assaulted on a now-infamous videotape.
Also facing trial are Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.

After two days of jury selection, the trial kicked off in earnest Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber, who has said it is expected to last about four weeks.
When Leinenweber took the bench around 10 a.m. Wednesday, he had a rather ominous proclamation: “Things are never intended to be easy,” he said.
One juror called to say she had developed a medical problem and wanted to be dismissed. Leinenweber excused her and replaced her with an alternate, changing the jury’s racial makeup to seven whites and five Blacks. Proceedings were further delayed when two other jurors were stuck on a late Metra train.
Later in the trial, jurors are expected to hear testimony from Kelly’s former goddaughter, who is now 37, as well as four other women who were minors when Kelly allegedly sexually assaulted them.
At the center of the case are three videotapes — portions of which will be shown to jurors — allegedly depicting Kelly having sexual contact with his goddaughter, who is being referred to by the pseudonym “Jane.” In two of them, Kelly repeatedly refers to her “14-year-old” anatomy, Julien said in his opening statement.
Another videotape allegedly depicting child pornography will not be shown to jurors because Kelly and the defendants successfully covered it up, according to prosecutors. But witnesses will testify about its existence, Julien said.

Kelly sat hunched at the defense table throughout opening statements, dressed in a dark blue suit and light blue tie. For the most part he appeared to be fixing his gaze straight ahead, even when Bonjean reintroduced him to the jury, which is seated to his left in the courtroom.
At times during prosecutors’ opening remarks, he shook his head slightly. And when Bonjean told jurors he was not expecting any special treatment, Kelly nodded.
Prosecutors said that when authorities started investigating one of the tapes in the early 2000s, Kelly sent “Jane” and her family on a monthlong trip out of the country, and when they got back, they lied to authorities about the tape at Kelly’s behest. Over the next few years they got drawn deeper into Kelly’s web, in part because Jane’s father was a guitar player in Kelly’s band, prosecutors said. At one point, the family became largely financially dependent upon him.
As Kelly was awaiting trial in Cook County, he and the co-defendants made wide-ranging efforts to locate and cover up other tapes of him with “Jane,” prosecutors said, including one payoff that happened during the 2008 trial, they said.
Kelly and his team went to “extraordinary lengths” to get the incriminating videotapes back and keep people from speaking out about their existence, prosecutors said. They paid out huge sums, including one payout during Kelly’s 2008 trial, according to Julien.

One such tape was returned by a man named Keith Murrell, Julien said. When he returned it, Brown told Murrell he had given them the “golden egg,” and after McDavid watched the tape, he gave Murrell a hug, Julien said.
Meanwhile, defense attorneys painted Murrell and other government witnesses as lying blackmailers — extortionists who stole sex tapes, tried to get rich off of them, and now will testify to whatever prosecutors want in exchange for immunity.
In opening statements on behalf of McDavid, attorney Vadim Glozman said the former business manager only acted at the behest of Kelly’s accomplished attorneys and investigators, none of whom would have risked their careers to cover up child pornography.
“Doing your job as a lawyer and doing your job as a business manager to a superstar is not a crime. Being successful in your efforts is not a crime,” Glozman said.
And back in the early 2000s, McDavid had every reason to believe the tape at the center of the Cook County case was illegitimate, Glozman said.
“Because he believed that, there was never any intention to obstruct justice,” he said.

McDavid will take the stand and testify on his own behalf, Glozman said.
Brown, meanwhile, was merely an assistant, a small cog in a large machine, his attorney, Kathleen Leon, said in her opening statement to the jury. Kelly deliberately kept all his “private dealings” secret from lower-level employees, and when rumors started circulating that Kelly was being blackmailed with a doctored sex tape, Brown believed them, Leon said.
As for Kelly, Bonjean acknowledged that many of the jurors said they were familiar with some of the allegations against him, but she warned them not to accept the simplistic portrait of a “monster” that had been portrayed by prosecutors.
“It is true that Mr. Kelly is imperfect,” she said. “It is true that on his journey from poverty to stardom that he stumbled along the way. It is important when the government wants to paint him as a monster that you remember we are talking about a human being. We implore you to keep those emotions in check.”
Prosecutors’ first witness was Darrel Turner, a psychologist who has worked with child sex abuse victims and offenders and was called to give context to the victims’ accounts later on in the trial.
Turner said it is extremely common for victims of underage sexual abuse to delay reporting that abuse for years. And victims who have been “groomed” frequently report feelings of love and protectiveness toward their abusers, he said. False allegations are extremely rare and usually come up in the context of divorce or custody proceedings, according to Turner’s testimony.

Near the end of the day, prosecutors called retired Chicago police Detective Daniel Everett, who first investigated Kelly in October 2000 after an anonymous complaint was filed, alleging that he was having sex with Jane. Everett says he interviewed the girl with her parents at a small shoe store in Oak Park.
“Jane informed me that Robert Kelly was her godfather and that he never abused her and never would do anything like that to her,” he said. Everett said he filed a report noting the abuse allegation was “unfounded.”
In February 2002, Everett said, then-Chicago Sun-Times music critic Jim DeRogatis turned over a sex tape that had been sent to him allegedly depicting Kelly and Jane — the same tape that was the focus of the Cook County charges.

Everett said he immediately recognized the girl on the tape as Jane. Days later, police searched Kelly’s home on West George Street, where Everett said he noticed several similarities with scenes that were on the video.
“After viewing the video it as very obvious that this was the setting where it took place,” Everett testified. He said police tried to re-interview Jane and her family, but were unable to contact them again.

Everett will be back on the witness stand for cross-examination on Thursday.
Several Kelly supporters were in the courtroom to view proceedings, including one woman with his name tattooed on her upper arm. As court adjourned and Kelly was escorted back into custody, many of his fans spoke up: “Goodbye, Robert!”
He gave them a wave as he walked out.

Jury to hear opening statements at R Kelly trial in Chicago,"CHICAGO (AP) — Opening statements set for Wednesday give prosecutors and R.

Kelly, who is Black, is accused of enticing minors for sex, of producing child pornography and of fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial at which he was acquitted.

"R Kelly jury picked in child pornography, trial-fixing case","CHICAGO – A federal jury was impaneled Tuesday in R. Kelly's hometown of Chicago to decide multiple charges against the R&B singer, as prosecutors and defense attorneys argued toward the end of the process about whether the government was improperly attempting to keep some Blacks off the jury.
Kelly, who is Black, is accused of enticing minors for sex, of producing child pornography and of fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial at which he was acquitted.
As the sides began exercising peremptory challenges — in which they can remove a fixed number of potential jurors from the pool — Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean accused prosecutors of seeking to strike Blacks “to deny Mr. Kelly a jury of his peers.”

Judge Harry Leinenweber partially agreed with the defense, disallowing prosecutors from striking three Blacks from the jury, and restoring them. About half the 12 jurors impaneled were identified as Black by the judge, prosecutor and defense attorneys.

Some of the jurors selected had watched at least part of a six-part documentary series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” about sex abuse allegations against the Grammy award-winning singer. Watching it wasn’t an automatic disqualification as long as a would-be juror could assure Judge Leinenweber they could still be impartial.
Among the 12 jurors selected was a retired real estate agent who had one son who was a prosecutor and another son who was a defense attorney. Another juror was a librarian.
Opening statements are scheduled for Wednesday morning, after which prosecutors will begin calling witnesses.
In all, the judge dismissed about half of the more than 100 potential jurors who were vetted over two days in a large, 25th floor courtroom in downtown Chicago.
Ad
Among those dismissed was a woman who said she had unfavorable views of police and judges, a woman who said she once took martial arts classes with Kelly’s kids and a man who said he didn't think the IRS should exist.
Leinenweber tended to dismiss would-be jurors when they expressed even the slightest reservations. He dismissed one juror who said large gatherings make him anxious, and a U.S. postal worker who worried mail would be delayed if she wasn't there.
Kelly, dressed in a gray suit and wearing a surgical mask over his mouth and nose, followed proceedings from a defense table, sometimes appearing to study would-be jurors Tuesday as they answered the judge's questions.
During a break around lunch, several Kelly supporters on court spectator benches made heart signs with their hands and directed them at Kelly. He appeared to notice across the courtroom, smiling and nodding his head.

Minor 1 first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school, according to pre-trial court filings by the government. The government contends she had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly. Soon after, Minor 1 told her parents Kelly was going to become her godfather.
Prosecutors say Kelly later threatened and sought to pay off Minor 1 and her parents so they wouldn't testify in 2008. None of them did.

R Kelly trial is about singer’s ‘hidden side’ court told,"R Kelly’s federal trial on allegations that he rigged his 2008 state child pornography trial and enticed girls for sex is about the R&B singer’s “dark” and “hidden” side, a prosecutor told jurors on Wednesday.
US assistant attorney Jason Julien said during opening statements that much of the world knew Kelly by his hit song I Believe I Can Fly.
Mr Julien said that was “Kelly’s public side”, then went on to add that “Kelly had another side – a hidden side, a dark side.”
“This trial is about Kelly’s hidden side,” Mr Julien said.
Kelly is charged in federal court in his home town of Chicago with enticing of minors for sex, producing child pornography and rigging his 2008 pornography trial at which he was acquitted.
Julien sought to give jurors a sense of the scale of Kelly’s alleged exploitation, saying he “repeatedly” had sex with girls who were just 14, 15 and 16 years old – “multiple girls, hundreds of times.”

Opening arguments made as R Kelly faces trial on sex charges,"R Kelly kept an ugly side of his life hidden as he escaped poverty in Chicago and rose to pop music stardom, a prosecutor told jurors at the singer’s trial on charges accusing him of enticing girls for sex and rigging a 2008 child pornography case.
Kelly’s lead lawyer implored jurors during her opening statement at the federal trial in Chicago not to accept what she said was the prosecution’s portrayal of her client as “a monster”.
Going back to the 1990s, much of the world knew Kelly solely by his hit songs, including the chart-topping inspirational anthem I Believe I Can Fly, US assistant attorney Jason Julien said.
But “Kelly had another side … a hidden side, a dark side,” he added.
“This trial is about Kelly’s hidden side.”

Kelly, 55, faces multiple charges, including enticing of minors for sex, producing child pornography and rigging his 2008 child pornography trial at which he was acquitted.
Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, has been trailed for decades by complaints and allegations about his sexual behaviour.
The scrutiny intensified after the #MeToo era and the 2019 six-part documentary Surviving R Kelly that detailed sex abuse allegations involving women and teenage girls.
Defence lawyer Jennifer Bonjean told jurors that Kelly, in part because of intellectual challenges that included illiteracy, was forced to rely on others as his career took off and that he was sometimes led astray by those in his circle of associates.
“Mr Kelly can also be a victim,” she said.

A conviction in Chicago could add decades to a 30-year prison sentence he already received from a New York federal judge for charges that he used his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Sitting at a defence table as the prosecutor spoke, Kelly occasionally shook his head as Mr Julien described Kelly manipulating and controlling girls, even beating them if they did not comply with strict rules that included calling him “daddy”.
Mr Julien sought to give jurors a sense of the scale of Kelly’s alleged exploitation, saying he “repeatedly” had sex with girls who were just 14, 15 and 16 years old, “multiple girls, hundreds of times”.

He told jurors that the evidence includes at least three videos showing Kelly having sex with underage girls.
“We’re not going to play hours of child pornography and make you watch it,” the prosecutor said, explaining they would see excerpts.
He added: “The videos are difficult to watch.
“But it is important to watch … to understand what happened.”
Kelly nodded his head in agreement when his lawyer told jurors Kelly is not looking for for special treatment, just a fair trial.
“When the government wants to paint him as a monster … you remember we are talking about a human being,” Ms Bonjean said.
She said jurors should not succumb to what she called “a mob justice climate” surrounding Kelly, alluding to Surviving R Kelly and years of harsh social media accounts of him.
“It is true that Mr Kelly is imperfect,” she said.
“On his journey from poverty to stardom, he stumbled along the way.”

Noi acuzații penale pentru celebrul R. Kelly. Artistul a fost deja condamnat la 30 de ani de închisoare,"R. Kelly are din nou probleme cu legea după ce a fost deja condamnat la 30 de ani de închisoare pentru infracțiuni sexuale. Noile acuzații sunt similare, iar dosarul se va judeca la un Tribunalul din Chicago, orașul natal la cântărețului. Procesul începe săptămâna aceasta și se anunță a fi unul extrem de mediatizat, transmite AFP.
Acuzații grave
Pe numele său complet, Robert Sylvester Kelly, artistul, în vârstă de 55 de ani, este acuzat că, împreună cu doi asociați, au schimbat cursul unui proces penal care îl viza pe cântăreț în 2008. Mai exact, victima a fost amenințată și apoi mituită, ca să nu depună mărturie. În lipsa declarației acesteia, R. Kelly a fost declarat acum atunci nevinovat.
Anchetatorii nu au renunțat, iar victima a fost acum de acord să depună acum mărturie în fața instanței. Artistul este acuzat de obstrucţionarea justiţiei, pornografie infantilă şi activitate sexuală ilegală cu un minor. În acest dosar sunt inculpați fostul său manager Derrel McDavid şi fostul angajat Milton „June” Brown, care l-ar fi ajutat pe R. Kelly să intimideze victima.
30 de ani de închisoare
R. Kelly a fost condamnat în luna iunie, de un tribunal din New York, la 30 de ani de închisoare pentru trafic de carne vie. El a fost acuzat că s-a folosit, timp de 25 de ani, de celebritatea și averea sa pentru a atrage tinere care au fost supuse ulterior la abuzuri sexuale. În timpul procesului, mai multe dintre victime au mărturisit că erau minore când au fost abuzate.
Condamnarea lui R. Kelly, prima dintr-un proces în care majoritatea părţilor civile erau femei de culoare, a fost văzută ca un punct de cotitură în mişcarea #MeToo. Victimele au povestit cum au fost racolate de artist care le-a promis că le va ajuta în carieră în schimbul unor favoruri sexuale. R. Kelly mai este cercetat penal în alte două state americane pentru fapte similare, potrivit npr.org.",2022-08-16T17:10:38Z,https://evz.ro,EVENIMENTUL ZILEI
R. Kelly ontkent opnieuw vader te worden,"R. Kelly verwacht geen kind samen met zijn verloofde Jocelyn Savage. Dat vertellen vertegenwoordigers van de 55-jarige artiest tegen de Amerikaanse entertainmentsite E! News. De 26-jarige Savage claimde in haar boek, dat afgelopen vrijdag verscheen, dat zij in verwachting is van een kind van R. Kelly.
Savage zegt in haar boek, Love and Joy of Robert, dat ze in juni ontdekte zwanger te zijn van Kelly, die momenteel vastzit in de gevangenis. Volgens Savage zou Kelly, die al drie kinderen heeft uit een eerder huwelijk, ""enorm blij"" zijn om weer vader te worden, maar zijn advocaat ontkent nu de zwangerschap.
Kelly zit al sinds 2019 vast. Hij werd in juni in de staat New York schuldig bevonden aan onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken. Eerder werd hij al schuldig bevonden aan vrijheidsberoving en dwangarbeid. Momenteel loopt een zaak tegen de artiest in Illinois.

Is convicted sex trafficker R. Kelly expecting another baby?
The musician, 55, is allegedly preparing to welcome a child with fiancée Joycelyn Savage, according to what she appears to have written in a short book, Love and Joy of Robert, released on Amazon.
However, despite the book allegation, Kelly's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, told E! News that Savage is not pregnant with the singer's child.
In the book, the 26-year-old shared that after feeling ill, she thought she'd contracted COVID-19 but instead learned ""the most amazing news""—that she was expecting a baby.
""It was a happy day but an incomplete time in my life,"" Savage wrote. ""Today I am grateful to God for giving me the most precious gift. Robert is extremely excited about the news that I am having a baby and feels sad that Robert will not be able to be here with us.""

R. Kelly back in court to face further sex crimes charges,"Disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly, who is serving a 30-year sentence for sex offenses, is back in court this week facing further charges.
Jury selection began on Monday in the latest case, which is being tried in the 55-year-old’s hometown of Chicago.
Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was convicted in New York in September of recruiting teenagers and women for sex.
The “I Believe I Can Fly” artist was found guilty of eight charges of sex trafficking and one count of racketeering.

In the Chicago case, Kelly and two ex-associates are accused of rigging the singer’s 2008 child pornography trial in which the jury delivered a verdict of not guilty.
ADVERTISEMENT
A minor victim, who has not been identified, declined to testify in the 2008 trial because of alleged threats and bribes, but is expected to take the witness stand this time.
Kelly, a three-time Grammy Award-winner, is charged with obstruction of justice, producing child pornography, and illegal sexual activity with a minor.
Also facing charges are Kelly’s former manager, Derrel McDavid, and an ex-employee, Milton “June” Brown. The trial is expected to last around four weeks.
As jury selection began, Kelly’s attorney Jennifer Bonjean filed a motion asking that anyone who watched a documentary called “Surviving R. Kelly” be disqualified from service.
Judge Harry Leinenweber denied the motion and proceeded to jury selection.
Kelly’s conviction in New York was widely seen as a milestone for the #MeToo movement: It was the first major sex abuse trial where the majority of accusers were Black women.
It was also the first time Kelly faced criminal consequences for the abuse he for decades was rumored to have inflicted on women and children.
Core to the state’s case was Kelly’s relationship with the late singer Aaliyah, which began when she was around 13 years old.
Kelly wrote and produced her first album Age Ain’t Nothin’ But A Number before illegally marrying her when she was just 15 because he feared he had impregnated her.

What Is R. Kelly on Trial For and Where Is He Right Now,"R. Kelly is facing a second federal trial, on different charges, set to take place in his hometown of Chicago.
Two months ago, the 55-year-old American R&B singer was given a 30-year prison sentence in New York. He was found guilty on nine counts of sex-trafficking and federal racketeering.
Jovante Cunningham, a former backup singer for Kelly, said outside the court after the hearing: ""I started this journey 30 years ago. There wasn't a day in my life up until this moment that I actually believed that the judicial system would come through for Black and brown girls.
""I stand here very proud of my judicial system, very proud of my fellow survivors and very pleased with the outcome.""
What Is R. Kelly on Trial For?
R. Kelly is currently facing a second federal trial, charged with child pornography, sexual exploitation of children and conspiracy to defraud the U.S.
The jury selection process was set to start on Monday. At least two women who claim Kelly coerced them into sex acts while they were underage are expected to testify during the trial.
This trial will likely discuss the previous allegations against him, as in 2008 he was put in a state trial on accusations of child pornography, which he was acquitted from.
According to The Associated Press, the charges ""relate to a video that allegedly showed him sexually assaulting and urinating on a 14-year-old girl, which first became public in 2002. Kelly was acquitted of recording the video in 2008 in an Illinois state trial, in which the alleged victim told a Cook County grand jury that the girl in the video was not her, reportedly under pressure from Kelly. She is now cooperating with federal prosecutors"".
Kelly will be put on trial with Derrel McDavid, his former business manager. McDavid is being charged with conspiring with Kelly to bribe witnesses and dispose of evidence in the 2008 trial, as well as obstruction of justice.
Judge Harry Leinenweber will be presiding over the case.
Is R. Kelly in Jail?
R. Kelly was previously incarcerated at a Brooklyn prison, but was moved to a Chicago detention center on July 12.
According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate database, Kelly is currently an inmate at the Chicago Metropolitan Correctional Center.
R. Kelly denies all of the current allegations of child pornography and sexual exploitation of children, as well as the past charges for which he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.",2022-08-16T09:28:53Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek

Jury expected to be empaneled Tuesday in R. Kelly’s federal trial,"R. Kelly turns himself in at 1st District police headquarters in Chicago on Feb. 22, 2019. (Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune)
The jury that will decide R. Kelly’s fate on federal charges stemming from the alleged sexual abuse of minors is expected to be empaneled in a Chicago courtroom on Tuesday after more questioning from the judge the ability of potential jurists to remain impartial.
U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber is scheduled to resume jury selection in the case at 10 a.m. in the large ceremonial courtroom at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse.

The judge questioned a total of 63 potential jurors on Monday, asking each person individually about what they know about the indicted R&B star and the allegations against him and his two co-defendants.
By the end of the day, a total of 34 jurors had made it past the first round of questioning — about six shy of where the judge said he wanted to be before moving on to the next phase, which will involve prosecutors and defense attorneys using peremptory strikes to get to a final panel of 12 regular jurors and six alternates.

Opening statements in the case would then follow, most likely on Wednesday.
Kelly, 55, was charged with child pornography and obstruction of justice in a 2019 indictment alleging he conspired with others to rig his Cook County trial years ago by paying off a teenage girl whom he sexually assaulted on a now-infamous videotape.
Also facing trial are Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.
Shortly before court began Monday, Kelly, dressed in a gray suit and tan shirt, was escorted into the courtroom by deputy U.S. marshals and took his seat at a crowded defense table, leaning over at times to whisper through a face covering to his attorneys.
Kelly who has been in federal custody since his July 2019 arrest, gave a nod and a slight wave to the jury pool as his attorney introduced him.
Potential jurors’ identities are being shielded from the public during the proceedings, and very little was revealed about them as Leinenweber asked each person to clarify answers they gave on a written questionnaire.
Of the 63 people questioned individually by the judge over nearly six hours, a total of 29 were dismissed, most of whom reported they would have trouble being impartial to Kelly or his co-defendants.
Some judges, faced with a prospective juror who is iffy about their neutrality, will try to “rehabilitate” them – reminding them of their civic duty to be fair, and asking pointedly if they can fulfill that obligation. But Leinenweber on Monday dismissed everyone who expressed even the tiniest doubts about their impartiality.

“Thinking about the case and the charges over the weekend, I no longer firmly believe that I can be unbiased,” one woman said at the outset of the questioning. Leinenweber promptly excused her.
Another woman said she went to Tae Kwon Do classes with Kelly’s children years ago, and the experience might keep her from being unbiased.
Another woman said her job involves advocating for children.
“I would do my best to be fair, be impartial. My only concern would be the defensiveness side kicking in, perhaps,” she said before Leinenweber excused her.
Much of the questioning revolved around the 2019 Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly,” which many potential jurors said they had watched or had at least heard of it.
Kelly’s lead attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, had asked the judge to automatically strike any juror who’d seen the documentary “for cause, saying the idea that they could remain impartial after such exposure “absurd.”

Leinenweber, though, said he would instead try to drill down on any potential biases through further questioning.
On Monday, one woman said she saw all 12 episodes of the series, but insisted it would not affect her ability to be fair — prompting some audible snickers from a few Kelly supporters watching from the courtroom gallery.
Another prospective juror said he watched part of an episode with his wife but didn’t remember anything substantive about it.

“I think I might have even fallen asleep before the end of it,” he said.
Leinenweber has said he wanted a winnowed-down pool of at least 40 potential jurors before moving to the peremptory strike phase.
The trial is Kelly’s first criminal case to go before a jury in his hometown since his stunning acquittal 14 years ago on the Cook County case.

Kelly faces a total of 13 counts, including production of child pornography, conspiracy to produce child pornography, and conspiracy to obstruct justice. Some of the counts carry a mandatory minimum of 10 years behind bars if convicted, while others have ranges of from 5 to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors are also seeking a personal money forfeiture of $1.5 million from Kelly.
Regardless of the outcome, Kelly is still facing decades in prison. In June, he was sentenced to 30 years on federal racketeering charges brought in New York. He is appealing both the jury’s verdict and the sentence in that case.

Jury to hear opening statements at R Kelly trial in Chicago,"Lawyers for two Kelly co-defendants will also address jurors before the government begins calling witnesses later Wednesday. Prosecutors haven't said who they will call first.
Both the prosecution and Kelly's legal team told the judge earlier in the week that they would like about an hour each to tell jurors about the kind evidence they can expect to see and hear. The evidentiary stage of the trial is expect to last about a month.
CHICAGO (AP) — Opening statements set for Wednesday give prosecutors and R. Kelly’s attorneys their first chance to address jurors directly about charges that accuse the R&B singer of enticing of minors for sex, producing child pornography and rigging his 2008 pornography trial.

The jury was impaneled Tuesday night with prosecutors and defense attorneys arguing toward the end of the process about whether the government was improperly attempting to keep some Blacks off the jury.
Kelly, who is Black, is accused of enticing minors for sex, of producing child pornography and of fixing his 2008 state child pornography trial at which he was acquitted.
As the sides began exercising peremptory challenges — in which they can remove a fixed number of potential jurors from the pool — Kelly attorney Jennifer Bonjean accused prosecutors of seeking to strike Blacks “to deny Mr. Kelly a jury of his peers.”
Prosecutors noted multiple African Americans had already made it onto the jury before the defense objected, and they argued their reasons for wanting to strike some had nothing to do with race. In one case, they said one older man appeared to have a hard time staying awake.
Judge Harry Leinenweber partially agreed with the defense, disallowing prosecutors from striking three Blacks from the jury, and restoring them. About half the 12 jurors impaneled were identified as Black by the judge, prosecutor and defense attorneys.

Six alternates were also selected.
Some of the jurors selected had watched at least part of a six-part documentary series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” about sex abuse allegations against the Grammy award-winning singer. Watching it wasn’t an automatic disqualification as long as a would-be juror could assure Judge Leinenweber they could still be impartial.
Among the 12 jurors selected was a retired real estate agent who had one son who was a prosecutor and another son who was a defense attorney. Another juror was a librarian.
Among those dismissed was a woman who said she had unfavorable views of police and judges and a man who said he didn't think the IRS should exist.
One central focus of the trial will be on whether Kelly threatened and paid off a girl with whom he allegedly videotaped himself having sex when he was about 30 and she was no older than 14. That's the allegation underpinning another of the charges against Kelly, conspiracy to obstruct justice.
Jurors in the 2008 child pornography trial acquitted Kelly, with some later explaining that they felt they had no choice because the girl did not testify. The woman, now in her 30s and referred to in court filings only as “Minor 1,” will be the government’s star witness in the federal trial that's expected to last four weeks.
When she testifies, prosecutors explained in court Monday that they won’t use her real name and won't refer to her as Minor 1. Instead, they will call her by a single pseudonym, “Jane.” Kelly's lawyers suggested they could contest where some of his accusers were minors at the time Kelly is accused if video recording or enticing them,

Kelly faces four counts of enticement of minors for sex — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are expected to testify.
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants at the Chicago trial. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.

R. Kelly jury selection focuses on 2019 documentary,"Michael Tarm And Don Babwin, The Associated Press
CHICAGO (AP) - Jury selection in R. Kelly's federal trial on charges that he rigged his 2008 state child pornography trial began Monday with the judge and attorneys quickly focusing on whether would-be jurors watched a 2019 documentary about sex abuse allegations against the R&B singer.
After denying a request from Kelly's attorney to automatically exclude anyone from the jury who watched the six-part documentary series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber quizzed potential jurors about how much they watched, what they could recall about it and whether they could be impartial if they were selected.
Jurors were asked whether they watched the documentary in a questionnaire they had already filled out. In one instance, a woman who had left her answer blank acknowledged that she had watched several episodes. She was not immediately excused from serving, however.
In all, the judge dismissed at least half of the some 60 would-be jurors he questioned Monday. Among those dismissed was an elementary school teacher who said he'd have difficulty being impartial given the subject matter of the trial, a man who said many of his closest friends were Chicago cops and a woman who said she once took martial arts classes with Kelly's kids.
Among those kept in the pool of possible jurors was a man with a post-graduate degree in classical music and several people who said they watched part of the documentary on Kelly but who assured the judge they could give the singer a fair trial.
Jury selection was expected to resume on Tuesday.
The trial centers on whether Kelly threatened and paid off a girl with whom he allegedly videotaped himself having sex when he was around 30 and she was no older than 14.

Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, faces multiple charges at the federal trial. They include four counts of enticement of minors for sex - one each for four other accusers. They, too, are slated to testify.
With the New York sentence alone, Kelly will be around 80 before qualifying for early release. Convictions in Chicago could add decades to Kelly's New York sentence, which he is appealing. A conviction for just one count of producing child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison.
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants at the Chicago trial. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.
Two state cases also are pending. One is a multiple count sex-abuse case out of Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago. The other is a solicitation case in Minnesota. No trial dates are set for either.
Minor 1 is expected to testify that she was on video having sex with Kelly. The recording was at the heart of the monthlong 2008 trial and was played for jurors almost every day.
Minor 1 first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly's Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly. Soon after, Minor 1 told her parents Kelly was going to become her godfather.
Prosecutors say Kelly later threatened and sought to pay off Minor 1 and her parents so they wouldn't testify in 2008. None of them did.
Double jeopardy rules bar the prosecution of someone for the same crimes they were acquitted of earlier. That doesn't apply to the federal trial because prosecutors are alleging different crimes related to Minor 1, including obstruction of justice.",2022-08-16T03:22:21Z,https://www.cp24.com,CP24 Toronto
El cantante R. Kelly afronta un nuevo juicio por obstrucción a la justicia y actividades sexuales con menores de edad,"El cantante R. Kelly afronta un nuevo juicio por obstrucción a la justicia y actividades sexuales con menores de edad
El rapero, que permanece encarcelado tras ser condenado en junio a 30 años de prisión, es acusado esta vez de mantener relaciones sexuales con otras cinco adolescentes y de grabar algunos de los abusos en videos.
En Chicago (Illinois) arranca esta semana un nuevo juicio federal contra el cantante estadounidense R. Kelly, que se enfrenta a 13 cargos relacionados con supuestas actividades sexuales ilegales con menores de edad, al tiempo que se le acusa de obstrucción a la justicia, informa USA Today.
En particular, el rapero, que permanece encarcelado desde que fue condenado en junio de este año a 30 años de prisión por abuso físico y sexual de mujeres y menores, está inculpado esta vez de mantener relaciones sexuales con otras cinco adolescentes y de grabar algunos de los abusos en videos. Asimismo, se le incrimina por conspirar para intimidar a sus víctimas y ocultar evidencias para obstruir a la justicia, incluida una investigación que derivó en 2008 en un proceso judicial por imputaciones de pornografía infantil, informa ABC News.
Además del músico, dos exempleados suyos —Derrel McDavid y Milton Brown—, figuran como coacusados en el actual proceso. El primero habría ayudado a Kelly a arreglar las pruebas para salirse con la suya durante el juicio de 2008, mientras que Brown está acusado de recibir los materiales pornográficos con menores de edad. Los tres inculpados han negado las alegaciones presentadas en 2019.
En junio de 2008, un jurado del condado de Cook absolvió a Kelly de los 21 cargos por pornografía infantil ligados a un video en el que aparecía el rapero manteniendo relaciones sexuales con una menor que ahora es una de las cinco demandantes.
La mujer, que ahora tiene unos 30 años y es mencionada en los documentos judiciales como 'Menor 1' conoció a Kelly en los años 90, cuando tenía 12 o 13 años. Según fiscales federales, el cantante y McDavid amenazaron a la víctima e intentaron sobornarla, tanto a ella como a sus padres, para que no declararan en el tribunal en 2008. Pese que a la 'Menor 1' no se pronunció, se espera que lo haga en el marco del actual juicio.",2022-08-16T02:24:39Z,https://actualidad.rt.com,RT en Español

Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants at the Chicago trial. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they also have denied wrongdoing.
Two state cases also are pending. One is a multiple count sex-abuse case out of Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago. The other is a solicitation case in Minnesota. No trial dates are set for either.
Minor 1 is expected to testify that she was on video having sex with Kelly. The recording was at the heart of the monthlong 2008 trial and was played for jurors almost every day.
Minor 1 first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly. Soon after, Minor 1 told her parents Kelly was going to become her godfather.
Prosecutors say Kelly later threatened and sought to pay off Minor 1 and her parents so they wouldn’t testify in 2008. None of them did.
Double jeopardy rules bar the prosecution of someone for the same crimes they were acquitted of earlier. That doesn’t apply to the federal trial because prosecutors are alleging different crimes related to Minor 1, including obstruction of justice.",2022-08-16T00:43:18Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

Kelly faces multiple counts of sexual exploitation of a child, enticement of a female, and possession of material containing child pornography
CHICAGO, USA – R&B singer R. Kelly’s latest federal trial began on Monday, August 15, with the selection of a jury to hear charges that he lured underage women into having sex with him and obstructed a 2008 state case that ended with his acquittal.
In a US district court in his hometown of Chicago, the 55-year-old multiplatinum musical artist faces multiple counts of sexual exploitation of a child, enticement of a female, and possession of material containing child pornography.
Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is among the most prominent people convicted of sexual misbehavior during the #MeToo movement against such conduct in recent years.
Kelly, his former business manager Derrel McDavid and associate Milton “June” Brown also face obstruction of justice charges. The three men are accused of trying to bribe and threaten witnesses in the 2008 Illinois case in which he was found not guilty on 14 counts of child pornography.
The three men have pleaded not guilty to the current federal charges. The trial is expected to last four weeks.
In a motion filed on Sunday, August 14, Kelly’s attorney Jennifer Bonjean requested the exclusion of any prospective juror who watched the Netflix documentary series Surviving R. Kelly, which chronicles the allegations against him.
At least one of Kelly’s alleged victims is expected to testify against him, according to court documents.
In June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on his conviction in a New York federal court on racketeering and prostitution charges. The trial amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the Grammy-winning hit “I Believe I Can Fly” for two decades.

R. Kelly’s Federal Trial Begins in Chicago With Jury Selection,"R. Kelly’s federal trial began today (August 15) in Chicago. Kelly is on trial for child pornography and obstruction charges in an Illinois federal court following his indictment in July 2019. The trial was originally set to start on April 27, 2020, but was delayed due the COVID-19 pandemic, and due to Kelly’s separate trial in a Brooklyn, New York federal court.
The first day of Kelly’s trial centered on jury selection; 60 potential jurors were questioned about the singer and the charges against him. Much of the questioning focused on the 2019 Lifetime documentary Surviving R. Kelly and whether or not the jurors had seen the limited series. Kelly’s attorney requested that U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber automatically exclude anyone who watched the six-part series; the request was denied. The court adjourned with the jury pool reduced to 34.
Kelly’s Illinois trial comes 14 years after his first trial in an Illinois federal court, in which he was acquitted of 14 counts of child pornography. In the 2008 trial, Kelly was accused of filming a sex tape with an underage woman, but the jury found that the woman’s identity was not conclusive after the woman believed to appear in the video refused to testify in court.
More than a decade later, prosecutors claim that Kelly and two former employees, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, paid off victims and witnesses in the 2008 trial. Kelly and his former employees have pleaded not guilty to these allegations. The R&B musician is also facing other sex crime charges in Illinois, as well as accusations of prostitution with a minor in Minnesota.
Kelly’s second Chicago trial follows his trial in a Brooklyn, New York federal court, where he was found guilty of racketeering and sex trafficking. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in June 2022. He later sued the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn—where he’s been incarcerated since June 2022—for placing him under suicide watch as a punitive measure. He was removed from suicide watch following the lawsuit.

CHICAGO (Reuters) – O mais recente julgamento federal do cantor de R&B R. Kelly começou nesta segunda-feira com a seleção de um júri para ouvir as acusações de que ele atraiu mulheres menores de idade para fazer sexo com ele e obstruiu um caso estadual de 2008 que terminou com sua absolvição.

"R. Kelly faces another federal trial, with accusers expected to testify","R. Kelly faces another federal trial, with accusers expected to testify
American singer-songwriter R. Kelly is facing federal child pornography and obstruction charges as jury selection begins Monday in his hometown of Chicago.
Kelly, 55, is accused of engaging in sex acts with five minors and recording some of the abuse on multiple videos. He is also accused of conspiring to intimidate victims and conceal evidence in an effort to obstruct law enforcement, including an investigation in the 2000s that resulted in his trial in 2008 on state child pornography charges, according to court documents.
All five accusers are expected to testify.
Two former employees of Kelly's music business, Derrel McDavid and Milton ""June"" Brown, are co-defendants in the federal trial. McDavid, 58, of Chicago, is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown, 53, also of Chicago, is accused of receiving child pornography, according to court documents. All three men have denied the allegations.
On June 13, 2008, a Cook County jury acquitted Kelly on all 21 counts of child pornography related to a video depicting him having sex with a minor, who is one of the accusers in the federal trial. That same tape cassette will be entered into evidence at the federal trial along with three other videos, according to court documents.
The woman, now in her 30s and referred to in filings only as ""Minor 1,"" met Kelly in the 1990s when she was 12 or 13 years old, according to court documents. Federal prosecutors alleged that Kelly and McDavid later threatened and sought to pay off Minor 1 and her parents so they wouldn't testify at the 2008 trial. They never did.
Born into poverty on Chicago's South Side, Kelly grew up to become lauded as an R &B legend and one of the most successful recording artists of all time, selling millions of albums worldwide and winning numerous accolades along the way, including three Grammy Awards. He was beloved by fans throughout much of his career despite being dogged by allegations of sexual misconduct.
That all seemed to change in January 2019, when American television channel Lifetime aired the documentary series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which featured on-camera interviews with several women claiming to have been sexually abused by the singer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly. The next month, Kelly was formally charged in Cook County with several counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.
The docuseries went on to receive high praise and win a 2020 Peabody Award. Meanwhile, Kelly was dropped by his record label and many other artists who had previously collaborated with him distanced themselves. During an interview with CBS News' Gayle King in March 2019, Kelly cried, shouted and jumped from his chair while denying any wrongdoing.
On Sept. 27, 2021, Kelly was convicted on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from his efforts over the years to use his superstardom status to ensnare and sexually abuse young fans, some of whom were just children. He was sentenced last month to 30 years in prison. Kelly has maintained his innocence and said he plans to appeal his conviction.",2022-08-15T22:00:27Z,https://abc7.com,KABC-TV
Verzoek R. Kelly om ‘onbevooroordeelde juryleden’ afgewezen,"Het verzoek van R. Kelly om potentiële juryleden die de documentaire Surviving R. Kelly hebben gezien niet toe te laten, is maandag door de rechter in Chicago afgewezen. Dat meldt de Chicago Tribune.
Rechter Harry Leinenweber ondervroeg maandag bij aanvang van het proces meerdere potentiële jurykandidaten over of zij wel of niet bevooroordeeld zouden zijn als zij zich in de jury uit zouden laten over de rapper, die onder meer verdacht wordt van het vervaardigen van kinderporno en het verleiden van minderjarigen tot seksuele handelingen. Hij wil graag een groep van veertig mensen voor de jury verzameld hebben voordat de volgende fase van het proces begint.
Diverse mensen gaven aan dat zij - vanwege uiteenlopende redenen - waarschijnlijk wel bevooroordeeld zouden zijn. Zij werden daarom door de rechter weggestuurd. Volgens de Chicago Tribune moet de komende tijd blijken wie er uiteindelijk in de jury plaats mogen nemen.
Eerder werd bekend dat de advocaten van R. Kelly een verzoek hadden ingediend om mensen uit de jury te houden als zij de documentaire Surviving R. Kelly hadden gezien.

Aug. 15 (UPI) -- R. Kelly, the R&B singer convicted last year for racketeering and sex trafficking, is facing another trial on federal child pornography and obstruction charges in his hometown of Chicago. Jury selection for the trial was scheduled to begin Monday morning at the Dirksen United States Courthouse in Chicago, according to guidelines previously set by the court. The trial will not be televised and a sketch artist has been assigned. Advertisement
Kelly, whose legal name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has been accused of coercing five children into sex acts and creating child pornography between September 1998 and September 1999, court records obtained by UPI show.
The minors were between the ages of 12 and 17 when they met the ""Pregnant"" crooner, according to court documents. All five of the alleged victims are expected to testify at the trial.

Kelly, 55, previously faced his first trial in Chicago in 2008 in which he was acquitted on 14 counts of producing child pornography by a jury of nine men and three women. A video at the heart of that trial has been entered into evidence in the new trial.
He will now face additional charges for allegedly conspiring to fix that trial with Derrel McDavid, a former employee who is a co-defendant in the latest trial, court records show. A third man, Milton Brown, has also been charged for having allegedly received missing recordings of the child sex abuse.
Kelly and his two co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty to their charges.

The first allegations of sexual abuse were revealed in a 1996 lawsuit filed by Tiffany Hawkins, a Chicago woman who said she had sex with Kelly in 1991 when she was 15. The lawsuit was later settled for $250,000.
Kelly previously married the singer Aaliyah in August 1994 when he was 27 and she was just 15 years old, though never faced criminal charges despite her being a minor at the time.
""Even though I don't believe any of these charges are warranted, I'm grateful that I will have a chance to establish the truth about me in a court of law,"" Kelly said in a statement issued in Los Angeles after his initial arrest in 2002 before his 2008 acquittal.

""I have complete faith in our system of justice, and I am confident that when all the facts come out, people will see that I'm no criminal.""
In January 2019, the six-part documentary series ""Surviving R. Kelly"" was released by Lifetime and brought renewed concern over the singer's checkered history after several women claimed on camera that they had survived sexual abuse at Kelly's hands.
Kelly was charged in Chicago in February 2019 after the release of the hit documentary and again by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn later that year. He was convicted on all nine counts in the Brooklyn case last September, including racketeering, the sexual exploitation of children, forced labor and transporting girls across state lines to engage in illegal sexual activity.
""Today's guilty verdict forever brands R. Kelly as a predator, who used his fame and fortune to prey on the young, the vulnerable, and the voiceless for his own sexual gratification,"" Acting U.S. Attorney Kasulis said in a statement at the time.
""A predator who used his inner circle to ensnare underage teenage girls, and young women and men, for decades, in a sordid web of sex abuse, exploitation and degradation.""",2022-08-15T20:32:00Z,https://www.upi.com,UPI News
Judge won't ban potential jurors who watched 'Surviving R. Kelly' docuseries,"CHICAGO — The federal judge presiding over R. Kelly’s Chicago trial on charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice ruled Monday that he will not ban people who have watched a damning docuseries about the disgraced singer from serving as jurors.
An attorney for Kelly, whose given name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, had asked the judge to disallow from the jury anyone who had seen ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" a six-part Lifetime documentary, calling it ""inflammatory.""
“It would be impossible for anyone who saw any part of the series to separate what they saw on TV and in the courtroom,” attorney Jennifer Bonjean said.
U.S. District Judge Harry D. Leinenweber for the Northern District of Illinois denied the request, saying that the series aired years ago and that it wouldn't make sense to prohibit someone from serving if they'd seen only part of the series.
“Surviving R. Kelly"" aired in 2019 and chronicled decades of the singer’s alleged sexual misconduct. The documentary contained more than 50 interviews and included testimony from women who accused Kelly of mental, physical and sexual abuse.
According to juror questionnaires, nine people indicated they had watched at least some of the docuseries and 70 indicated they had not.
The judge's ruling came on the first day of jury selection in a case that stems from the complaints of several women who allege that Kelly, 55, lured them into sex acts while they were underage. At least two are expected to testify, according to court documents.
Illinois federal prosecutors allege that Kelly obstructed justice in a 2008 criminal trial in Cook County, which involved a video recording of him allegedly sexually abusing a minor. He was acquitted in that case.
Kelly, who has denied any wrongdoing, is being tried alongside his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and associate, Milton “June” Brown, who are both accused of conspiring with Kelly to intimidate and bribe witnesses and cover up evidence in the 2008 trial, according to the federal charges against them.
Kelly and Brown were in court Monday.
Jury selection is expected to conclude Tuesday, with the group of prospective jurors whittled down to 12 jurors and six alternates.
In addition to being asked if they had ever watched the docuseries and how much of it they had seen, jurors on Monday also were asked if they were familiar with the #MeToo movement and if they had been or knew someone who had been a victim of sexual abuse.

R. Kelly back in court to face further charges,"R. Kelly back in court to face further charges
Washington: Disgraced R&B singer R. Kelly, who is serving a 30-year sentence for sex offenses, is back in court this week facing further charges.
Jury selection began on Monday in the latest case, which is being tried in the 55-year-old´s hometown of Chicago.
Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was convicted in New York in September.
Also facing charges are Kelly´s former manager, Derrel McDavid, and an ex-employee, Milton ""June"" Brown. The trial is expected to last around four weeks.
As jury selection began, Kelly´s attorney Jennifer Bonjean filed a motion asking that anyone who watched a documentary called ""Surviving R. Kelly"" be disqualified from service.

R. Kelly está de volta aos tribunais - e outra vez por crimes sexuais,"Robert Sylvester Kelly, de 55 anos, foi declarado culpado em Nova Iorque de chefiar durante décadas uma ""rede"" de exploração sexual de mulheres e adolescentes e condenado a 30 anos de prisão.
No tribunal de Chicago, enfrenta acusações de obstrução da justiça, produção de pornografia infantil e atividade sexual ilegal com uma menor de idade.
Kelly e dois ex-sócios são acusados de obstruir o julgamento de pornografia infantil de 2008, no qual o júri o declarou inocente, ao ameaçar e subornar uma vítima que acabou por não testemunhar. É esperado que deponha no novo julgamento.
Os outros dois réus são o seu ex-empresário Derrel McDavid e Milton ""June"" Brown, ex-funcionário do cantor. O julgamento deve durar cerca de quatro semanas.
A sua advogada, Jennifer Bonjean, pediu que qualquer pessoa que tenha visto o documentário ""Surviving R. Kelly"", que dá voz a várias das suas vítimas, seja excluída do júri, mas o juiz Harry Leinenweber negou a solicitação.
A condenação de R. Kelly em Nova Iorque, a primeira num julgamento em que a maioria das partes civis eram mulheres negras, foi vista como um ponto de viragem no movimento #MeToo.
Os debates lançaram luz sobre o ""sistema"" de R. Kelly para atrair mulheres jovens e violá-las, com a cumplicidade de pessoas próximas a elas.

R. Kelly jugé dans une nouvelle affaire de crimes sexuels,"Salman Rushdie va mieux et a pu parler, ont affirmé dimanche son fils et son agent. Cela deux jours après que l'écrivain britannique a été violemment poignardé une dizaine de fois par un Américain d'origine libanaise lors d'une conférence dans le nord des Etats-Unis.
Cette attaque vendredi matin sur la scène d'un amphithéâtre du centre culturel de la ville tranquille de Chautauqua, près du lac Erié dans le nord de l'Etat de New York, a choqué en Occident mais a été saluée par des extrémistes musulmans.
L'intellectuel britannique et américain de 75 ans n'est plus sous assistance respiratoire et ""la voie du rétablissement a commencé"", s'est félicité son agent Andrew Wylie dans un communiqué transmis au Washington Post.
""Les blessures sont graves, mais son état évolue dans la bonne direction"", a ajouté ce proche de l'écrivain à la renommée mondiale, poignardé une dizaine de fois au cou et à l'abdomen. Un homme de 24 ans, Hadi Matar, s'était précipité sur l'estrade avant que M. Rushdie ne prenne la parole au centre culturel de Chautauqua.
""Humour intact""
Zafar Rushdie, son fils, a confirmé sur Twitter que son père ""avait pu dire quelques mots"" et qu'il avait ""conservé intact son sens de l'humour"". La famille s'est dite ""extrêmement soulagée"".
Salman Rushdie reste hospitalisé à Erié, en Pennsylvanie, au bord du lac qui sépare les Etats-Unis du Canada.
Si les nouvelles de dimanche sont rassurantes, l'agent Wylie avait été alarmiste vendredi en parlant de blessures graves au bras et au foie et la perte possible d'un oeil.
L'animateur de la conférence, Henry Reese, 73 ans, qui a été légèrement touché au visage, a raconté sur CNN que l'attaque ""ressemblait à une sorte de mauvaise blague (qui) n'avait pas l'air réelle. Quand il y a eu du sang derrière lui, c'est devenu réel"".
Leur agresseur, Hadi Matar, né aux Etats-Unis, vivant dans le New Jersey et dont les parents sont d'un village du sud du Liban, a été inculpé de ""tentative de meurtre et agression"".
En tenue rayée noire et blanche de détenu, menotté et masqué, il n'a pas dit un mot samedi soir devant le tribunal de Chautauqua et a plaidé ""non coupable"" par la voix de son avocat. Il doit comparaître de nouveau le 19 août.
Attaque préméditée
Sans donner de mobile, les procureurs ont qualifié l'attaque de préméditée.
L'attentat a provoqué une onde de choc, particulièrement en Occident: le président américain Joe Biden a rendu hommage à M. Rushdie pour son ""refus d'être intimidé et réduit au silence"".
Vivant à New York depuis vingt ans, naturalisé américain en 2016, Salman Rushdie avait repris une vie publique à peu près normale tout en continuant de défendre, dans ses livres, la satire et l'irrévérence.
Coïncidence, le magazine allemand Stern l'avait interviewé quelques jours avant l'attaque: ""Depuis que je vis aux Etats Unis, je n'ai plus de problème (...) Ma vie est de nouveau normale"", assure l'écrivain, dans cet entretien à paraître le 18 août, en se disant ""optimiste"" malgré ""les menaces de mort quotidiennes"".
Salman Rushdie, né en 1947 en Inde dans une famille d'intellectuels musulmans non pratiquants, avait embrasé une partie du monde islamique avec la publication en 1988 des ""Versets sataniques"", jugés par les musulmans les plus rigoristes comme blasphématoires à l'égard du Coran et du prophète Mahomet, et conduisant l'ayatollah iranien Rouhollah Khomeiny à émettre la fatwa réclamant son assassinat.
La fatwa n'a de fait jamais été levée et beaucoup de ses traducteurs ont subi des attaques.
Combat ""universel""
""Son combat est le nôtre, universel"", avait lancé le président Emmanuel Macron, tandis que le secrétaire général de l'ONU Antonio Guterres s'était déclaré ""horrifié"".
Le chef du gouvernement israélien Yair Lapid - dont le pays est l'ennemi de l'Iran - a dénoncé ""le résultat de décennies d'incitation au meurtre par le régime extrémiste iranien"". Mais dans des pays musulmans, l'attaque a été saluée par des extrémistes.
En Iran, le quotidien ultraconservateur Kayhan a félicité ""cet homme courageux et conscient de son devoir qui a attaqué l'apostat et le vicieux Salman Rushdie"" et le journal Javan écrit dimanche qu'il s'agit d'un complot des Etats-Unis qui ""veulent probablement propager l'islamophobie dans le monde"".
Au Pakistan voisin, le parti Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan - réputé pour sa violence contre ce qu'il considère comme du blasphème antimusulman - a jugé que Rushdie ""méritait d'être tué"".
Au Royaume-Uni, la police enquête sur une menace dont l'autrice de Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling, dit être la cible sur Twitter, après avoir exprimé son soutien à Salman Rushdie.

R. Kelly Loses Bid to Exclude Jurors Who Watched Documentary,"R. Kelly’s second trial got underway in a courthouse in Chicago on Monday, as his defense lost a bid to exclude potential jurors who have seen the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”
Kelly was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison, after being convicted in New York last year on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking.
Jury selection began Monday morning in federal court in Chicago, where Kelly is facing numerous charges of child pornography and conspiracy to obstruct an investigation. The government alleges that Kelly coerced underage girls to have sex with him, videotaped the sex acts, and then paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to reclaim copies of the videos in an effort to thwart the investigation.
The charges relate to Kelly’s 2008 trial, in which he was acquitted after the alleged victim refused to testify. Prosecutors allege that he supplied money and gifts to the girl and her parents in order to get them to deny that she had sex with Kelly.
These events were covered at length in “Surviving R. Kelly,” which debuted in January 2019. In a motion filed on Sunday, Kelly’s defense lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, argued that any juror who had watched even a portion of the documentary series should be excluded from the trial.
“Any person who has seen the documentary would possess information about the allegations in this indictment (and unrelated allegations) that would unquestionably interfere with his/her ability to decide the case based on the evidence that is introduced at trial,” Bonjean wrote. “No one, even a well-intentioned person, would be capable of purging his brain of information obtained through the docuseries or separating information learned from the documentary that was never subject to cross-examination from testimony introduced at trial on the same subject matter.”
Bonjean noted that the documentary covered some evidence — such as Kelly’s relationship with the singer Aaliyah — that has been excluded from the trial.
Judge Harry Leinenweber denied the motion on Monday, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Robert Sylvester Kelly, 55 ans, avait été reconnu coupable à New York d'avoir piloté pendant plusieurs décennies un ""système"" d'exploitation sexuelle de jeunes, dont des adolescentes, et condamné fin juin à 30 ans derrière les barreaux.
Le procès devrait durer un mois
Il est accusé devant le tribunal de Chicago d'obstruction à la justice, de production de pédopornographie et d'activité sexuelle illégale avec une personne mineure. Lui et deux anciens associés sont accusés d'avoir perturbé le cours de son procès pour pédopornographie en 2008, au cours duquel le jury l'avait déclaré non coupable, en ayant à la fois menacé et corrompu une victime, qui n'avait alors pas témoigné, mais devrait cette fois prendre la parole.
Les deux autres accusés sont son ancien manager Derrel McDavid et un ancien employé Milton ""June"" Brown. Le procès devrait durer environ quatre semaines.

Legal documents, which were obtained by TMZ stated, ""any potential juror who has watched any portion of this docuseries must be disqualified for cause on whether they can be fair, too great a risk exists that such a juror would base their verdict on matters not introduced into evidence in the courtroom.""

Defense attorney Jennifer Bonjean wrote in a letter filed Sunday that any prospective juror who has seen a portion of Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly” wouldn’t be able to separate the allegations in the documentary and the evidence presented at the trial.
“No one, even a well-intentioned person, would be capable of purging his brain of information obtained through the docuseries or separating information learned from the documentary that was never subject to cross-examination from testimony introduced at trial on the same subject matter,” Bonjean wrote to US District Judge Harry Leinenweber.
She added that the 2019 docuseries features interviews with a number of witnesses whom prosecutors intend to call at the trial, including Lisa Van Allen and Jerhonda Pace.
“There is substantial overlap between the subject matter of this prosecution and the subject matter of the documentary,” Bonjean wrote.

R Kelly’s federal trial on whether he fixed 2008 trial set to start,"Singer R. Kelly leaves the Leighton Criminal Court Building after a hearing on sexual abuse charges in Chicago on June 06, 2019.KAMIL KRZACZYNSKI/AFP/Getty Images
Jury selection begins Monday at R. Kelly’s federal trial in his hometown of Chicago, where the R&B singer faces charges that he rigged his 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening and paying off a girl who he allegedly filmed himself having sex with when he was around 30 and she was no older than 14.
Jurors acquitted Kelly on all charges in that 2008 trial, some explaining later that they felt they had no choice because the girl did not testify. The woman, now in her 30s and referred to in filings only as “Minor 1,” will be the government’s star witness in the upcoming federal trial.
Kelly, 55, goes into Chicago federal court Monday already sentenced by a New York federal judge to a 30-year prison term for a 2021 conviction on charges he used his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, faces multiple charges at the federal trial. They include four counts of enticement of minors for sex — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are slated to testify.
Convictions in Chicago could add decades to Kelly’s New York sentence, which he is appealing. With the New York sentence alone, Kelly will be around 80 before qualifying for early release.
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants at the Chicago trial. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they have also denied any wrongdoing.
Two state cases are also still pending. One is a multiple count sex-abuse case out of Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago. The other is a solicitation case in Minnesota. No trial dates are set for either.
Minor 1 is expected to testify that she was on video having sex with Kelly. The recording was at the heart of the monthlong 2008 trial and was played for jurors almost every day.
Minor 1 first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly. Soon after, Minor 1 told her parents Kelly was going to become her godfather.

R. Kelly will go on trial in Chicago federal court on August 15, 2022, his second federal trial in less than one year. The 55-year-old “I Believe I Can Fly” singer faces child pornography and obstruction of justice charges in relation to five alleged victims. Federal prosecutors in this case said that Kelly had sexual encounters with these accusers when they were under 18 years old — and recorded these incidents on video. These alleged sex crimes took place in the late 1990s and early 2000s. When the charges came down against Kelly, prosecutors said, “This indictment demonstrates our office’s commitment to holding individuals such as Kelly accountable for criminal sexual abuse of minors, protecting the victims of such crimes, and punishing those who obstruct law enforcement investigations.” Earlier this summer, on June 29, 2022, the disgraced performer was hit with a 30-year prison sentence in his Brooklyn federal court racketeering and sex crimes case.
While there are definitely some similarities between Kelly’s Chicago case and proceedings in Brooklyn — they’re about the sexual abuse of minors — there are some dramatic differences as well. Two of Kelly’s alleged co-conspirators, Darryl McDavid and Milton “June” Brown, will face trial alongside Kelly in his Chicago trial. They’re accused of trying to clean up Kelly’s alleged misdeeds — and help him thwart his 2008 child pornography trial in Chicago, which ended in his acquittal. These alleged cover-up attempts included coordinating payments to accusers and a potential whistleblower. McDavid and Brown have pleaded not guilty. Kelly has stuck by his not guilty plea, despite his conviction and three-decade prison sentence from his Brooklyn case. Here’s what you need to know about R. Kelly’s Chicago federal trial.
What is R. Kelly accused of, exactly?
A lot. In his Chicago case, Kelly is accused of produced and received child pornogaphy as well as lured minors into engaging in sexual activity. Charging documents accuse Kelly of having sexual encounters with five minors and recording some of his alleged abuse on “multiple videos.” In addition, Kelly is accused of plotting to intimidate victims and hide evidence to “obstruct law enforcement.” This includes his alleged efforts to derail his 2008 state child pornography trial in Chicago.
Who are the people on trial with Kelly?
When Kelly’s Chicago federal court indictment was revealed, it also charged two of his ex-employees, Derrell McDavid and Milton Brown, who’s known as June Brown. McDavid and Brown were both charged with conspiracy to receive child pornography. McDavid, who used to work for Kelly, also stands accused of conspiracy to obstruct justice. So what, exactly, does this mean?
According to charging paperwork, in 2001 Kelly and McDavid started paying off an acquaintance “hundreds of thousands of dollars” to scoop up recordings that had gone missing “for the purpose of concealing and covering up their existence.” However, the acquaintance allegedly decided later on to have a press conference in 2008 where he would disclose that he collected these videos. Kelly and McDavid, as well as unspecified “others,” then gave him about $170,000 to cancel the event. The duo agreed to pay one of Kelly’s alleged victims and another unidentified person for working to return the recordings “but only after they took polygraph examinations to confirm they returned all copies in their possession,” the charges allege.
The charging documents also outline how Kelly and McDavid tried to keep “Minor 1,” the girl in his 2008 trial, from coming forward. Kelly allegedly directed her to lie to cops when they first suspected wrongdoing in the early 2000s. Kelly and McDavid are also accused of telling the girl’s father to lie to grand jurors about the videotape. The Feds also claim that Kelly and McDavid made payments to the girl and her family from 2000 to 2015 to keep them from discussing the encounter. “The case against Mr. McDavid is essential [sic] a case against the legal team that defended R. Kelly in 2008,” Vadim A. Glozman, who represents McDavid, said. “He was doing what he thought was in the best interest of his client, at the direction of his lawyers. He did nothing wrong or improper and we intended to prove that at trial.” Brown’s attorney did not want to comment at this time.
Back up. What was this other Chicago trial?
Kelly drew the attention of authorities in the late 1990s, years after he became a superstar. According to a Chicago Sun Times article by Jim DeRogatis and Abdon M. Pallasch, police started to probe whether Kelly and a girl, identified in Chicago federal court papers as “Minor 1”, were having sexual encounters. The minor and her parents denied any sexual activity. In April 2000, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services began to investigate whether the superstar was committing sexual abuse against “Minor 1,” according to charging paperwork. DeRogatis and Pallasch reported in December 2000 that Kelly “used his position of fame and influence as a pop superstar to meet girls as young as 15 and have sex with them.” About two years later, DeRogatis received a tape in his mailbox allegedly showing Kelly having sex with this minor, per the New York Times. In June 2002, Kelly was charged in Chicago state court with 21 counts of child pornography, in relation to what the Feds describe as “Video 1 and Minor 1.” Now, this language is very important, as it shows the overlap between the Chicago trial some 20 years ago and the 2022 proceedings. In the 2019 Chicago federal indictment, prosecutors are charging Kelly in relation to the minor and video from his trial two decades ago. The Feds also say that about one year before the 2008 trial, McDavid and Brown tried to pay someone for videotapes showing Kelly allegedly having sex with “Minor 1.”
The girl in Kelly’s prior Chicago case, “Minor Victim 1,” refused to testify against him at that trial, leading to his notorious acquittal in 2008. Her willingness to come forward has apparently changed, however. According to reports, she has cooperated with the Feds in these recent federal proceedings. She is expected to testify, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
If Kelly was convicted, why are words like “allegedly” being used to describe the Chicago case?
In short, the cases are different. On October 27, 2021, Kelly was convicted of one racketeering count and eight Mann Act counts in his Brooklyn federal court case. The Mann Act is a statute that prohibits transporting persons across state borders for illicit sexual activity. Kelly’s charges in his Brooklyn case involved six women: Pace Pace, Jane, Stephanie, Sonja, Faith, and Aaliyah. The Chicago case involves child pornography and obstruction charges, of which Kelly has not been convicted. In other words, he was found guilty in Brooklyn of one set of crimes, but at present he is presumed innocent of the charges in his Chicago federal case. Meanwhile, Kelly also faces state sex crime charges in Illinois and allegations of prostitution with an underage person in Minnesota, according to the New York Times.
Where is Kelly now?
Kelly has been locked up since the federal indictments came down in 2019. He is presently in a Chicago federal jail. Kelly’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, has filed paperwork indicating that they will appeal his Brooklyn conviction. Bonjean did not respond to a request for comment.",2022-08-15T12:00:14Z,https://www.vulture.com,Vulture
R Kelly trial on whether he fixed 2008 hearing set to start,"Jury selection begins on Monday at R. Kelly's federal trial in his hometown of Chicago, where the R and B singer faces charges that he rigged his 2008 state child pornography trial by threatening and paying off a girl who he allegedly filmed himself having sex with when he was around 30 and she was no older than 14.
Jurors acquitted Kelly on all charges in that 2008 trial, some explaining later that they felt they had no choice because the girl did not testify.
The woman, now in her 30s and referred to in filings only as “Minor 1”, will be the government's star witness in the upcoming federal trial.
Kelly, 55, goes into Chicago federal court Monday already sentenced by a New York federal judge to a 30-year prison term for a 2021 conviction on charges he used his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, faces multiple charges at the federal trial.
They include four counts of enticement of minors for sex — one each for four other accusers. They, too, are slated to testify.
Convictions in Chicago could add decades to Kelly's New York sentence, which he is appealing. With the New York sentence alone, Kelly will be around 80 before qualifying for early release.
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants at the Chicago trial. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they have also denied any wrongdoing.
Two state cases are also still pending. One is a multiple count sex-abuse case out of Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago. The other is a solicitation case in Minnesota. No trial dates are set for either.
Minor 1 is expected to testify that she was on video having sex with Kelly. The recording was at the heart of the month-long 2008 trial and was played for jurors almost every day.
Minor 1 first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly's Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly. Soon after, Minor 1 told her parents Kelly was going to become her godfather.
Prosecutors say Kelly later threatened and sought to pay off Minor 1 and her parents so they wouldn't testify at the 2008 trial. None of them did.
Double jeopardy rules bar the prosecution of someone for the same crimes they were acquitted of earlier.
That doesn't apply to the Chicago federal trial because prosecutors are alleging different crimes related to Minor 1, including obstruction of justice.

Começa julgamento de R. Kelly por novo caso de crimes sexuais,"No tribunal de Chicago, enfrenta acusações de obstrução da justiça, produção de pornografia infantil e atividade sexual ilegal com uma menor de idade
O cantor de R&B R. Kelly, condenado em junho a 30 anos prisão por exploração sexual, será julgado por acusações semelhantes em sua cidade natal, Chicago, onde a seleção do júri começou nesta segunda-feira (15).
Robert Sylvester Kelly, de 55 anos, foi declarado culpado em Nova York de chefiar durante décadas uma “rede” de exploração sexual de mulheres e adolescentes e condenado a 30 anos de prisão.
No tribunal de Chicago, enfrenta acusações de obstrução da justiça, produção de pornografia infantil e atividade sexual ilegal com uma menor de idade.
Kelly e dois ex-sócios são acusados de obstruir o julgamento de pornografia infantil de 2008, no qual o júri o declarou inocente, ao ameaçar e subornar uma vítima que acabou não testemunhando. É esperado que ela deponha no novo julgamento.
Os outros dois réus são seu ex-empresário Derrel McDavid e Milton “June” Brown, ex-funcionário do cantor. O julgamento deve durar cerca de quatro semanas.
Sua advogada, Jennifer Bonjean, pediu que qualquer pessoa que tenha visto o documentário “Surviving R. Kelly”, que dá voz a várias de suas vítimas, seja excluída do júri, mas o juiz Harry Leinenweber negou a solicitação.
A condenação de R. Kelly em Nova York, a primeira em um julgamento em que a maioria das partes civis eram mulheres negras, foi vista como um ponto de virada no movimento #MeToo.
CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE
Os debates lançaram luz sobre o “sistema” de R. Kelly para atrair mulheres jovens e estuprá-las, com a cumplicidade de pessoas próximas a elas.
Muitas vítimas relataram ter conhecido o cantor em shows ou apresentações em centros comerciais, e que sua equipe entregou a elas papeizinhos com o contato de Kelly.
O cantor também é processado em outros dois estados.

Kelly jury selection focuses on 2019 documentary Back to video After denying a request from Kelly’s attorney to automatically exclude anyone from the jury who watched the six-part documentary series, “Surviving R. Kelly,” U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber quizzed potential jurors about how much they watched, what they could recall about it and whether they could be impartial if they were selected. Jurors were asked whether they watched the documentary in a questionnaire they had already filled out. In one instance, a woman who had left her answer blank acknowledged that she had watched several episodes. She was not immediately excused from serving, however. In all, the judge dismissed at least half of the some 60 would-be jurors he questioned Monday. Among those dismissed was an elementary school teacher who said he’d have difficulty being impartial given the subject matter of the trial, a man who said said many of his closest friends were Chicago cops and a woman who said she once took martial arts classes with Kelly’s kids.

R. Kelly’s attorney wants any would-be jurors who’ve seen ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ docu-series removed,"A number of last-minute issues are already hanging over R. Kelly’s federal trial in Chicago as jury selection gets underway on Monday, including a request by Kelly’s attorney over the weekend to dismiss potential jurors who have seen the popular Lifetime docu-series “Surviving R. Kelly.”
In a motion filed Sunday, Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, wrote that the potential pitfalls over the series, which details years of sexual misconduct allegations against the Chicago-born R&B singer, go far beyond the usual concerns over jurors being exposed to negative pretrial publicity.
Advertisement
“This is an issue of potential jurors possessing a mountain of information about the specific allegations in this case and the witnesses’ stories that will play center stage at this trial and may or may not be admissible,” Bonjean wrote. “Allowing an individual to sit on this jury who has seen ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ is no different than allowing a juror to sit on the jury who was permitted to preview the discovery in this case.”
A pool of about 100 potential jurors came to the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse last week to fill out questionnaires, including their thoughts about the high-profile defendant, who was sentenced in June to 30 years in prison on federal racketeering charges brought in New York.
Advertisement
In her motion, Bonjean revealed that some members of the jury pool indicated on their forms that they’d seen “Surviving R. Kelly” and could not be fair to Kelly. Others said they could still be impartial despite being exposed to at least some of series -- a representation that Bonjean said was “absurd.”
Prosecutors had not responded to the motion as of Sunday night.
Kelly, 55, was charged with child pornography and obstruction of justice in a 2019 indictment alleging he conspired with others to rig his Cook County trial years ago by paying off a teenage girl whom he sexually assaulted on a now-infamous videotape.
Also facing trial are Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.
U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber is set to begin questioning jurors at 10 a.m. in the large ceremonial courtroom on the 25th Floor of the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse. The trial is expected to last at least four weeks.
Though Kelly is already facing what could be the rest of his life behind bars, the trial about to unfold in Chicago seems ripe for intrigue.
For one, Kelly’s attorney, Bonjean, is a veteran litigator who relishes taking on what she portrays as an unchecked and overzealous government, representing controversial clients such as actor Bill Cosby and Gangster Disciples boss Larry Hoover. Brown’s lawyer, Mary Judge, is also well-respected and a 25-year veteran of the Federal Public Defender’s Office in Chicago.
McDavid, meanwhile, is represented by Chicago attorneys Beau Brindley and Vadim Glozman, who have shown in a flurry of pretrial motions that they intend to aggressively fight the charges, even if it means potentially throwing Kelly under the bus.
Advertisement
And in an added twist, Brindley himself was acquitted by Leinenweber seven years ago of criminal charges alleging he’d coached clients to lie on the witness stand -- a case that the Tribune first reported when the FBI raided Brindley’s office in the famed Monadnock Building across the street from Chicago’s federal courthouse.
The attorney who defended Brindley in that case, the late Edward Genson, was Kelly’s lead attorney in his 2008 child pornography trial.
Leinenweber, 85, is one of the senior statesmen of Chicago’s federal bench, with a well-worn reputation for fairness, an acute knowledge of the law and a fairly low tolerance for nonsense.
However the evidence shakes out, Kelly’s trial is the most high-profile event at the typically buttoned-down Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in the 2 ½ years since the onset of the pandemic.

Kelly’s die-hard followers — some who live-tweet events in his case and post social media videos that garner millions of views — are expected to show up in droves to support him, just like they did at his first Cook County trial and his Brooklyn trial.

And the scene could be just as theatrical inside the courtroom. Recent weeks have seen a flood of pretrial motions, each seemingly more bombastic than the last.
Prosecutors want to bar Kelly’s defense from presenting expert testimony that Kelly has an IQ of about 79, saying his alleged intellectual deficiencies are irrelevant to whether he videotaped himself molesting underage girls. Kelly’s defense wants to prohibit prosecutors from calling an expert witness to testify about child sex abuse and grooming.
Most dramatically, perhaps, McDavid’s legal team has argued in a series of strongly worded motions that prosecutors botched the chain of custody for the key videotape in the case, in which Kelly allegedly sexually assaulted his then-13-yer-old goddaughter, identified in the charges only as Minor 1.
The defense has also accused the former lead prosecutor on the case, Angel Krull, of having inappropriate contact with Minor 1, who is now in her mid-30s, as well as Jim DeRogatis, the Chicago journalist whose reporting decades ago was the first to bring the accusations against Kelly to light.

CHICAGO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - R&B singer R. Kelly's latest federal trial began on Monday with the selection of a jury to hear charges that he lured underage women into having sex with him and obstructed a 2008 state case that ended with his acquittal.
In a U.S. district court in his hometown of Chicago, the 55-year-old multiplatinum musical artist faces multiple counts of sexual exploitation of a child, enticement of a female and possession of material containing child pornography.
Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is among the most prominent people convicted of sexual misbehavior during the #MeToo movement against such conduct in recent years.

Kelly, his former business manager Derrel McDavid and associate Milton “June” Brown also face obstruction of justice charges. The three men are accused of trying to bribe and threaten witnesses in the 2008 Illinois case in which he was found not guilty on 14 counts of child pornography.
The three men have pleaded not guilty to the current federal charges. The trial is expected to last four weeks.
In a motion filed on Sunday, Kelly's attorney Jennifer Bonjean requested the exclusion of any prospective juror who watched the Netflix documentary series ""Surviving R. Kelly,"" which chronicles the allegations against him.
At least one of Kelly's alleged victims is expected to testify against him, according to court documents.
In June, Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison on his conviction in a New York federal court on racketeering and prostitution charges. The trial amplified accusations that had dogged the singer of the Grammy-winning hit ""I Believe I Can Fly"" for two decades. read more

Leute - R. Kelly muss erneut vor Gericht,"Direkt aus dem dpa-Newskanal
New York (dpa) - Nur wenige Wochen nach seiner Verurteilung zu 30 Jahren Haft muss sich Ex-Popstar R. Kelly ab heute erneut einem Missbrauchsprozess stellen. In seiner Heimatstadt Chicago beginnen die Verhandlungen vor einem Bundesgericht zunächst mit der Auswahl der Jury-Mitglieder.
Insgesamt ist Kelly in 13 Punkten angeklagt: Unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen, der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen und Behinderung der Justiz. Auch zwei frühere Angestellte von ihm sind angeklagt.
Dabei geht es auch um ein bereits viele Jahre bekanntes Video, dass Kelly (55) zeigen soll, wie er ein 14-jähriges Mädchen missbraucht. In diesem Fall war der Musiker 2008 von einer Jury bereits freigesprochen worden.
Die Staatsanwaltschaft wirft ihm nun aber vor, das Opfer unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit diese nicht in dem Prozess aussagt. In der nun anstehenden Gerichtsverhandlung soll die mittlerweile volljährige Frau aber aussagen. Es wird damit gerechnet, dass der Prozess einen Monat dauern könnte. Ihm droht erneut eine jahrzehntelange Haftstrafe.
R. Kelly sitzt seit 2019 im Gefängnis
Der ""I believe I can fly""-Sänger war Ende Juni in New York in einem Missbrauchsprozess zu einer Haftstrafe von 30 Jahren und einer Geldbuße von 100.000 Dollar verurteilt worden. Bereits im vergangenen Jahr hatte eine Jury den Musiker nach mehrwöchigem Prozess in allen neun Anklagepunkten - darunter sexuelle Ausbeutung Minderjähriger, Kidnapping und Bestechung - für schuldig befunden. Kelly hatte die Vorwürfe stets zurückgewiesen. Er sitzt seit Sommer 2019 im Gefängnis.
Das Verfahren ist - nach Fällen wie denen von Filmproduzent Harvey Weinstein und Komiker Bill Cosby - eine weitere viel beachtete juristische Aufarbeitung in der MeToo-Ära.
Erste Anschuldigungen gegen den 1967 in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborenen Musiker wurden bereits vor rund 25 Jahren bekannt. Doch der Musik-Koloss schien unangreifbar auf seinem Pop-Thron und blieb lange Zeit auf freiem Fuß. Mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben, mehreren Grammys und anderen Auszeichnungen gehörte er zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern des späten 20. Jahrhunderts.
Aber spätestens als 2019 die aufsehenerregende Dokumentation ""Surviving R. Kelly"" die Anschuldigungen zusammenfasste, wurde es um den Sänger immer einsamer. Stars distanzierten sich von ihm, zudem Radiosender, Streaming-Dienste und dann auch sein Musiklabel.

Veroordeelde R. Kelly staat opnieuw terecht voor misbruikzaken,"In Chicago begint maandag een nieuw proces tegen R. Kelly. De 55-jarige zanger is in de Amerikaanse stad aangeklaagd voor onder meer het vervaardigen van kinderporno en het verleiden van minderjarigen tot seksuele handelingen.
Eind juni werd Kelly in New York al schuldig bevonden in een vergelijkbare zaak. Voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken, kreeg hij een celstraf van 30 jaar opgelegd. Ook werd hij schuldig bevonden aan vrijheidsberoving, dwangarbeid en verschillende overtredingen van de Amerikaanse 'Mann Act', de federale wetgeving rond mensenhandel. Voor de nieuwe zaak is hij half juli van New York overgeplaatst naar een gevangenis in Chicago.
De zaak in Chicago volgt veertien jaar na een eerder proces tegen de zanger in de staat Illinois. Ook toen werd hij beschuldigd van seksueel wangedrag tegenover minderjarige vrouwen, maar werd hij uiteindelijk vrijgesproken. Officieren van justitie in Chicago zeggen nu dat Kelly en twee van zijn voormalige werknemers de uitkomst van de zaak probeerden te manipuleren door getuigen en slachtoffers om te kopen. Kelly en zijn werknemers beweren zich hier niet schuldig aan te hebben gemaakt.
Fans
Qua sfeer wordt door Amerikaanse media, waaronder The New York Times, verwacht dat deze rechtszaak anders zal zijn dan die in New York. Waar er in dat proces op zittingsdagen slechts een handjevol fans bij de rechtbank stond om de zanger te steunen, worden er in Kelly's geboorteplaats Chicago veel meer verwacht. Hij zou er nog altijd veel fans hebben.
De verhalen rond het misbruik door Kelly stammen al uit de jaren 90 en namen weer toe na het verschijnen van de documentaireserie Surviving R. Kelly uit 2019. Hierin beweerden meerdere vrouwen op minderjarige leeftijd slachtoffer van hem te zijn geworden. Na het zien van de beelden riepen openbaar aanklagers in Chicago vermeende slachtoffers op naar voren te komen.",2022-08-15T01:30:00Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen

R. Kelly: Surprise Witness to Testify in Upcoming Chicago Trial,"While R. Kelly’s Brooklyn criminal trial resulted in him being found guilty of racketeering and sentenced to 30 years in prison, the trial was just the first of many. The disgraced R&B singer is set to stand trial in Illinois for similar crimes. He also has forthcoming trials in Florida, Georgia, and Minnesota. But recent reports reveal that a witness from his 2008 child pornography trial, which resulted in him being found not guilty, is a surprise witness in his upcoming trial.

R. Kelly’s upcoming trial to have surprise witness from his 2008 child pornography case
Kelly’s next trial is set to begin on Monday, Aug. 15. His first trial featured testimony from employees and accusers. But one person who will take the stand this time around is the alleged victim in his 2008 child pornography trial.
Source: YouTube
In the video centered around the 2008 trial was said to be a 14-year-old teenager who Kelly allegedly urinated on during recording. She, now in her 30s, is set to take the stand to detail her relationship with Kelly. Madame Noire reports that the woman will also address previous claims about whether she was bribed or threatened out of testifying in the original trial.
At the time of the 2008 trial, the teenager was identified as “Minor 1” and denied that she was the 14-year-old girl in the video, despite family members and friends of the girl taking the stand to identify her. She never testified. Kelly was later acquitted, with many believing he was found not guilty because the alleged victim didn’t testify.
The video will be played as evidence in the upcoming trial
During the forthcoming trial, prosecutors will play the VHS tape containing “Minor 1” in court for jurors to view. There are also reportedly three new additional videos to be played and used as evidence. It’s unclear whether the new footage submitted is also from 2008 and features the same victim.
Source: YouTube
According to a legal expert, prosecutors are using this trial as a do-over of the original failed 2008 trial. “This case is more centered on things that happened in the past, particularly with regard to the prior legal proceedings in state court in Illinois,’’ Michael Leonard told NBC News. Leonard briefly worked on Kelly’s legal team in 2020.
R. Kelly reportedly bribed the victim and her family
For years, it’s been rumored that Kelly bribed the victim and her family with a financial settlement and a lavish vacation in order for them to not testify against him. In fact, the alleged victim’s father is said to be a musician who continued working with Kelly after the trial. Singer Sparkle took the stand in the 2008 trial and identified the alleged victim as her niece.
The alleged victim is said to have first met Kelly in the late ‘90s when she was in junior high school and was to work with Kelly on music. Court documents allege that after meeting, the alleged victim and Kelly had sex “hundreds of times” over the years at his Chicago home and while he was on tour.
The alleged victim’s parents, one of which is said to be Sparkle’s brother, allegedly confronted Kelly about the sex tape. Government filings allege Kelly allegedly told them, “You’re with me or against me” adding that “Minor 1’s mother did not want to go up against Kelly’s power, money, and influence by not following what he said.”

"R. Kelly Faces Federal Trial in Chicago on Charges of Child Pornography, Obstruction of Justice","R. Kelly’s federal trial in Chicago that starts Monday is in many ways a do-over of his 2008 state child pornography trial, at which jurors acquitted the singer on charges that he produced a video of himself when he was around 30 having sex with a girl no older than 14.
There’s one big difference: This time, prosecutors say, she will testify.
Kelly, 55, goes into Chicago federal court already sentenced by a New York federal judge to a 30-year prison term for a 2021 conviction on charges he parlayed his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Among the most serious charges the Grammy Award winner faces at his federal trial is conspiracy to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial, including by paying off and threatening the girl to ensure she did not testify.
Stay informed about local news and weather. Get the NBC10 Boston app for iOS or Android and pick your alerts.
Testimony by the woman, now in her 30s and referred to in filings only as “Minor 1,” will be pivotal. The charges against Kelly also include four counts of the enticement of minors for sex — one count each for four other accusers. All are also slated to testify.
Even just one or two convictions in Chicago could add decades to Kelly’s New York sentence, which he is appealing. With the New York sentence alone, Kelly will be around 80 before qualifying for early release.
Prosecutors at the federal trial plan to play the same VHS tape that was “Exhibit No. 1″ at the 2008 trial. While it was the only video in evidence 14 years ago, at least three other videos will be entered into evidence at the federal trial.
Prosecutors say Kelly shot the video of Minor 1 in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home between 1998 and 2000 when she was as young as 13. In it, the girl is heard calling the man “daddy.” Federal prosecutors say that she and Kelly had sex hundreds of times over the years in his homes, recording studios and tour buses.
Before the 2008 trial, Kelly carried a duffle bag full of sex tapes everywhere he went for years, but some tapes later went missing, according to court filings. In the 2000s, bootleg copies of some videos appeared on street corners across the U.S.
After R&B star R. Kelly was found guilty of nine federal counts of racketeering and sex trafficking, attorney Gloria Allred, who represented several of Kelly’s victims, spoke out about the heinous nature of his crimes, including knowingly spreading genital herpes and using child pornography to blackmail his victims into compliance.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it.
On June 13, 2008, Kelly shut his eyes tight and bowed his head as jurors returned from deliberations. As a court official read the jury’s decision and it became clear Kelly would be acquitted on all counts, tears streamed down his cheeks and he said over and over, “Thank you, Jesus.”
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants in Chicago. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they have also denied any wrongdoing.
Double jeopardy rules bar the prosecution of someone for the same crimes they were acquitted of earlier. But that shouldn’t apply to the Chicago federal trial because prosecutors are alleging different crimes related to Minor 1, including obstruction of justice for fixing the 2008 trial.
Minor 1 first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly’s music. Soon after that meeting, Minor 1 told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
In the early 2000s, the aunt showed the parents a copy of a video she said depicted their daughter having sex with Kelly. When they confronted Kelly, he told them, “You’re with me or against me,” a government filing says.
The parents took it as a threat.
“Minor 1’s mother did not want to go up against Kelly’s power, money, and influence by not following what he said,” the filing adds.
After a nearly three-hour hearing, the R&B singer was sentenced to 30 years in prison over convictions of racketeering and sex trafficking.
Kelly told the parents and Minor 1 they had to leave Chicago, paying for them to travel to the Bahamas and Cancun, Mexico. When they returned, prosecutors say Kelly sought to isolate Minor 1, moving her around to different hotels.
When called before a state grand jury looking into the video, Minor 1, her father and mother denied it was her in it. Prosecutors say an attorney for Kelly sat in on their testimony and reported back to Kelly what they said.
Prosecutors from the Cook County state’s attorney’s office chose to push ahead with charges and to take the case to trial in 2008 despite what they knew was a major hurdle: their inability to call the girl in the video to testify.
Any confidence Kelly may have had of beating similar charges a second time were likely dashed when he learned Minor 1 was now cooperating with the government. With more resources, federal prosecutors also boast conviction rates of more than 90% compared to around 65% for their state counterparts.
In 2008, his lawyers argued the man in the VHS video who appeared very much to be Kelly was not Kelly. They showed jurors that Kelly has a large mole on his back, then played excerpts of the video in which no mole was visible on the man.
One of Kelly’s attorneys, Sam Adam Jr., told jurors during closings that no mole on the man’s back meant one thing: “It ain’t him. And if it ain’t him, you can’t convict.”
Some 2008 jurors told reporters after the trial that they weren’t convinced the female in the video was who state prosecutors said she was.
That shouldn’t be an issue at the Chicago federal trial. Prosecutors say both the girl and her parents will testify.
What defense Kelly’s legal team will present this time isn’t clear.
The defense is likely to say Kelly’s accusers are misrepresenting the facts. Kelly was more blunt in a 2019 interview with Gayle King of “CBS This Morning,” saying about the women: “All of them are lying.”",2022-08-14T18:56:49Z,https://www.nbcboston.com,NBC10 Boston
R. Kelly’s Chicago federal trial to put spotlight on legal tactics,"By Jason Meisner and Megan Crepeau | Chicago Tribune
CHICAGO — When Chicago-born R&B star R. Kelly walked out of the Cook County criminal courthouse a free man in 2008, it wasn’t just a stroke of luck.
Kelly’s stunning acquittal on child pornography charges nearly a decade and a half ago was the result of a carefully crafted strategy by a team of veteran Chicago criminal defense attorneys, who employed nearly every street-fight tactic in the 26th and California legal playbook.
Bury the court with paper. Delay the proceedings for years. Dirty up every witness you can. And when it comes to the prosecutors’ smoking gun, a videotape allegedly showing Kelly sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl, relentlessly question its authenticity — and keep the victim on your side.
Fifteen years later, Kelly is going on trial again in Chicago, this time at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, where the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer stands accused of conspiring to rig the Cook County trial years ago by paying off the victim on the now-infamous videotape.
Also facing trial are Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.
The trial, which gets underway with jury selection Monday, comes on the heels of Kelly’s federal racketeering case in New York, which involved similar allegations of sexual misconduct and resulted in a guilty verdict and 30-year sentence levied in June.
With the 55-year-old Kelly already facing what could be the rest of his life behind bars, some observers argued whether it makes sense to spend so many public resources to try Kelly again. Kelly also faces four pending cases in Cook County, which have largely been on hold since the federal indictments were revealed.
Sources said there were initial discussions of a plea deal earlier in the proceedings, but with Kelly appealing both his conviction and sentence in New York, they never really got off the ground.
Now, the trial about to unfold in Chicago seems ripe for intrigue. For one, Kelly’s new criminal defense attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, is a veteran litigator who relishes taking on what she portrays as an unchecked and overzealous government, representing controversial clients such as actor Bill Cosby and Gangster Disciples boss Larry Hoover.
McDavid, meanwhile, is represented by Chicago attorneys Beau Brindley and Vadim Glozman, who have shown in a flurry of pretrial motions that they intend to aggressively fight the charges, even if it means potentially throwing Kelly under the bus. Brown’s lawyer, Mary Judge, is also well-respected and a 25-year veteran of the Federal Public Defender’s Office in Chicago.
At the center of the trial is U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber, who at 85 is one of the senior statesmen of Chicago’s federal bench, with a well-worn reputation for fairness, an acute knowledge of the law and a fairly low tolerance for nonsense.
At a pretrial conference earlier this month, Leinenweber signaled he intends to run a tight ship, in part because the large ceremonial courtroom where the trial is being held is in high demand due to COVID-19 protocols still in place in the building. He said he wants to keep time-consuming sidebars to a minimum, and if a lawyer from either side tests positive for COVID-19, their colleagues will have to pick up the slack.
“We’re going to get it done in four weeks come hell or high water,” Leinenweber said. “I have a reputation of moving a case along.”
Not an easy legal climb
Winning an acquittal is always an uphill battle in Chicago’s federal court, where the U.S. attorney’s office has a nearly perfect record when it comes to celebrities, politicians or other high-profile defendants.
But Kelly’s path to victory could be even more unlikely, given that the evidence for the child pornography charges is significantly stronger than it was when Kelly was first indicted in Cook County in 2002.
Prosecutors are expected to present to jurors four videotapes depicting Kelly having sex with a minor — not just one. But potentially far more damaging to Kelly is that the girl depicted on the tapes, who refused to testify in 2008, is now cooperating with law enforcement, as is her mother.
The victim, now in her mid-30s, is expected to identify herself on the videos, and both she and her mother are expected to testify about efforts by Kelly and his team to keep them quiet — including flying the family to the Bahamas and Mexico and giving her father, who was a bassist in Kelly’s band, checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Steven Greenberg, who was Kelly’s chief attorney until a rift in the defense team prompted him to leave the federal cases in 2021, told the Tribune in an interview last week that Kelly enjoyed “the super-presumption of innocence” in his trial in 2008, when he was still a famous musician with a string of recent hits.
But the public’s view of Kelly has changed significantly since then, starting with the #MeToo-era docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” and ending with his high-profile trial in New York, which featured testimony from nearly a dozen victims of his alleged sexual and psychological abuse.
”Jurors are human, and while they say they can decide the case based on the evidence in the courtroom, anyone that claims they haven’t heard anything about R. Kelly is probably lying,” Greenberg said. “And anyone who says they don’t have some opinion about R. Kelly is probably lying.”
Bonjean posted to Twitter on Friday that it will be “difficult to find 12 people who can be fair given the media war on my client.”
“The government starts with an incredible advantage but we are going to fight like hell to get a jury that will follow the law,” she wrote.
Greenberg said the trial will likely pit the three defendants against each other, with McDavid trying to pin any wrongdoing on Kelly and his lawyers at the time “who orchestrated it.”
“And Kelly is going to say, if anything, it was McDavid and the lawyers,” Greenberg said.
When Kelly’s first criminal trial was unfolding in 2008, rumors abounded about the location of the alleged victim on the videotape, who was actually a potential witness for the defense. Behind the scenes, it was known that the girl had been living at Kelly’s south suburban mansion. She’d even been taken shopping for something to wear on the stand by the wife of an attorney on Kelly’s legal team. But she was never called to testify.
Dick Devine, who headed the Cook County state’s attorney’s office back then, told the Tribune his team strongly suspected at the time that the young victim and her family were being “taken care of” to keep them from cooperating, but they could not prove it.
”We did try to figure out what was going on and see if there were any links we could establish,” he said in an interview last week. “But as you can imagine, the people involved did not want to cooperate at all, and did not. So we reached dead ends in many of the things we were pursuing.”
The prosecution team was “very frustrated” that the central witness and her parents were not in place, Devine said. But he said “they did their best, they tried a good case, but it simply wasn’t enough in light of the gaps that were there, at least according to the jury.”
Devine said that they brought the case knowing it would be tough to win, and at one point rejected an offer from Kelly’s camp to have him plead guilty and get a slap on the wrist.
The trial, he said, was “kind of a slugfest day to day,” with the throngs of R. Kelly fans outside the courthouse, the aggressive moves from his defense team, and the strong suspicions of witness tampering.
”It’s part of our legal history, and I don’t think the best part, but one we’re living with,” Devine said.
Details of the case
The federal charges Kelly is now facing fall into two overlapping categories. Some allege he repeatedly molested underage girls and would make videotapes of their sex acts. The obstruction charges allege that, when he got wind that authorities were investigating, he bought back incriminating tapes and paid off witnesses so they wouldn’t cooperate with law enforcement.
According to a recent prosecution filing, the evidence will span a 23-year period from 1991 to 2014, when Kelly rose to the height of his fame before becoming the butt of late-night comics’ jokes.
Jurors are expected to hear evidence about four videos made by Kelly during that time depicting him sexually abusing an underage girl: his goddaughter from the original tape, who is identified in the charges only as Minor 1. Other witnesses are also expected to testify that Kelly had sexual contact with them when they were underage, and that he often taped those encounters as well.
Some of the evidence the jury is expected to hear is well-documented territory in Kelly’s history of sexual conduct: The tripods and camcorders at his recording studios, tour buses and hotel rooms; the gym bag of VHS tapes containing child pornography he allegedly carried around; the threats of civil suits followed by nondisclosure settlements.
Prosecutors allege that beginning in 2001, Kelly and his entourage became aware of multiple videos missing from Kelly’s “collection” and that he and McDavid orchestrated a scheme of payoffs to get them back and keep others quiet about Kelly’s relationship with Minor 1.
In addition to Minor 1, two other women who were underage at the time of the alleged conspiracy are expected to testify that Kelly struck up a sexual relationship with Minor 1 when she was as young as 13 and videotaped himself assaulting her in his home, at his studios, on tour buses and in hotel rooms.
In one video that jurors are expected to see, Kelly is having sex with Minor 1 at his home on George Street in Chicago while she is wearing a “distinctive” necklace — the same necklace that she is wearing in a passport photo taken about the same time, according to prosecutors.
In the early 2000s, Chicago police attempted to locate Minor 1 for questioning but Kelly’s team had her flown to the Bahamas and Mexico for weeks to get away from law enforcement, according to prosecutors.
When they returned to Chicago, Kelly’s team “isolated” Minor 1 from her family, monitoring her phone calls and moving her around to different hotels, according to prosecutors. That lasted until her parents agreed to deny that it was Minor 1 on the videotape, prosecutors said.
Another woman, identified as Minor 5, is expected to testify that Kelly began having sexual contact with her when she was 14 or 15. He would often tape their sex acts, as well as sex acts involving her and other underage girls, according to prosecutors.
When police began to investigate the videotape in late 2001, Minor 5 initially identified Minor 1 as the girl on the footage. But later on, Kelly persuaded her to lie to the grand jury and say she did not know of any sexual relationship between Kelly and Minor 1, according to prosecutors.
After her first sexual contact with Kelly, Minor 5 is expected to testify that he told her: “We all have secrets now.”
Trial drama expected
However the evidence shakes out, Kelly’s trial is the most high-profile event at the typically buttoned-down Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in the two-and-a-half years since the onset of the pandemic.
Kelly’s die-hard followers — some who live-tweet events in his case and post social media videos that garner millions of views — are expected to show up in droves to support him, just like they did at his first Cook County trial and his Brooklyn trial.
And the scenes could be just as theatrical inside the courtroom. Recent weeks have seen a flood of pretrial motions, each seemingly more bombastic than the last.
Prosecutors want to bar Kelly’s defense from presenting expert testimony that Kelly has an IQ of about 79, saying his alleged intellectual deficiencies are irrelevant to whether he videotaped himself molesting underage girls. Kelly’s defense wants to prohibit prosecutors from calling an expert witness to testify about child sex abuse and grooming.
Most dramatically, perhaps, McDavid’s legal team has argued in a series of strongly worded motions that prosecutors botched the chain of custody for the key videotape involving Minor 1, and accused the former lead prosecutor on the case, Angel Krull, of having inappropriate contact with the alleged victim as well as Jim DeRogatis, the Chicago journalist whose reporting decades ago was the first to bring the accusations against Kelly to light.

Verzoek R. Kelly om juryleden die misbruikdocu gezien hebben te weren afgewezen,"In de docu uit 2019 vertellen slachtoffers van R. Kelly over het misbruik dat zij hebben meegemaakt. Volgens de advocaten van de rapper is iedereen die deze film heeft gezien en voor de jury wordt opgeroepen „bevooroordeeld en kunnen ze niet onpartijdig zijn.” Het verzoek van R. Kelly is maandag echter door de rechter in Chicago afgewezen. .
Rechter Harry Leinenweber ondervroeg maandag bij aanvang van het proces wel meerdere potentiële jurykandidaten over of zij wel of niet bevooroordeeld zouden zijn als zij zich in de jury uit zouden laten over de rapper, die onder meer verdacht wordt van het vervaardigen van kinderporno en het verleiden van minderjarigen tot seksuele handelingen. Hij wil graag een groep van veertig mensen voor de jury verzameld hebben voordat de volgende fase van het proces begint.
Diverse mensen gaven aan dat zij - vanwege uiteenlopende redenen - waarschijnlijk wel bevooroordeeld zouden zijn. Zij werden daarom door de rechter weggestuurd. Volgens de Chicago Tribune moet de komende tijd blijken wie er uiteindelijk in de jury plaats mogen nemen.

R. Kelly's Alleged 2008 Victim Set To Finally Testify In Court,"Back in June, singer R. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison after being found guilty of 9 federal charges which included sex crimes and human trafficking. For years, many women have publicly expressed how the artist's alleged actions have changed the course of their entire lives. Now, another victim, who has remained anonymous for years, has decided to tell her story in court.

In 2008, R. Kelly's child pornography trial began nearly five years after he was indicted. The trial was infamous, as it was centered around a video of the singer allegedly having sex with and urinating on a teenage girl. For a while, the tape circulated the country and was viewed by thousands of people. The victim, who has yet to be identified, was supposed to appear in court to testify but never did, which caused Kelly to be acquitted of all charges.
However, the sufferer, who is now in her 30s, is set to come forward in a new trial. According to AP News, she will testify to the allegations that Kelly rigged the '08 case by bribing and/or threatening her. Aside from her testimony, the 29-minute video, along with three others they obtained (which may or may not relate to the 2008 trial), will be played as evidence.

Federal prosecutors have claimed that the then minor and nearly 30-year-old R. Kelly had sex hundreds of times between the years of 1998 and 2000. Their intercourse took place in his homes, recording studios, and tour buses, according to the media outlet.
Robert has pleaded not guilty, claiming that all the women are lying on him.

Ny rettssak mot R. Kelly,"I RETTEN IGJEN: R & B-veteranen R. Kelly (55).
Ny rettssak mot R. Kelly
I 2008 ble R. Kelly frifunnet for å ha laget en video politiet hevdet viste ham ha seksuell omgang med en 13 år gammel jente. Mandag starter ny rettssak, og denne gangen skal kvinnen for første gang vitne.
Publisert: For mindre enn 30 minutter siden
I juli ble det klart at R & B-veteranen R. Kelly (55) må sone 30 år i fengsel, etter at han fjor høst ble dømt for menneskehandel og seksuelle overgrep.
Førstkommende mandag må Kelly på nytt møte i en domstol i Chicago – i en rettssak som på mange måter minner om en rettssak han ble frifunnet for i 2008.
Kelly sto den gangen blant annet tiltalt for ha laget overgrepsmateriale, og de amerikanske påtalemyndigheten hevdet en video viste Kelly ha seksuell omgang med en 13 år gammel jente. Kelly ble derimot frifunnet på alle punkter.
I 2008 nektet både Kelly og den da 23 år gamle kvinnen for at det var dem som var i videoen. Ingen av dem vitnet under rettssaken.
Forskjellen denne gangen er at kvinnen, som i dag er i 30-årene, skal vitne, ifølge flere amerikanske medier.
AP skriver at påtalemyndigheten mener Kelly betalte og truet kvinnen til å ikke vitne i 2008, noe han må svare for i rettssaken som starter mandag.
Anklagene mot Kelly denne gangen inkluderer også fire tilfeller av lokking av mindreårige for seksuell omgang.
Ble advart mot grove scener
I 2008-rettssaken ble det vist en video, og retten ble advart mot svært grove scener. Kelly ble beskyldt av aktoratet for å ha iscenesatt og deltatt i «fryktelige, forstyrrende og forkastelige sexhandlinger» med den mindreårige jenta.
Også denne gangen er planen at den 27 minutter lange videoen skal vises for retten. Tre nye videoer vil også bli avspilt, ifølge AP.
Kelly risikerte 15 års fengsel i 2008, dersom han hadde blitt dømt.
Det var etter en seks uker lang rettssak i september i fjor at Kelly ble funnet skyldig på alle punkter for menneskehandel og seksuelle overgrep. 11 ofre sto frem og vitnet, ni kvinner og to menn. Ifølge New York Times var bevisgrunnlaget basert på vitnemålene til seks ikke navngitte kvinner.
Ifølge nyhetsbyrået AP mener Kelly at han er uskyldig og planlegger å anke dommen.",2022-08-14T09:17:57Z,https://www.vg.no,VG
R. Kelly to face federal trial in Chicago on charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice,"CHICAGO — Nearly two months after he was convicted and handed a 30-year prison sentence in New York on charges of federal racketeering and sex- trafficking, disgraced musician R. Kelly is set to return to court for a second federal trial, this time on charges of child pornography and obstruction of justice, in his hometown of Chicago.
Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday in a case that stems from the complaints of several women who allege that Kelly, 55, lured them into sex acts while they were underage. At least two are expected to testify, according to court documents.
This trial is expected to resurface accusations brought against Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, 14 years ago in a state trial on charges of child pornography for which he was eventually acquitted.
Illinois federal prosecutors allege that Kelly obstructed justice in that 2008 criminal trial in Cook County, which involved a video recording of Kelly allegedly sexually abusing a minor.
The singer will be tried alongside his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and associate, Milton “June” Brown, who are both accused of conspiring with Kelly to intimidate and bribe witnesses and cover up evidence in the 2008 trial, according to the federal charges against them.
Kelly has denied any wrongdoing.
Neither Kelly’s lawyers nor prosecutors responded to NBC News’ requests for comment.
Mary Higgins Judge, an attorney representing Brown, declined to comment. Brown pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
Beau Brindley, an attorney for McDavid, said in a statement that during the time relevant to the charges in the case, he “did only one thing: he did his job.
“It was his job to protect Robert Kelly’s image and his career. To do that, he hired some of the best lawyers in the United States,” Brindley said. “Those are the only people with whom Mr. McDavid entered into any agreements relevant to this case. Mr. McDavid and these lawyers did their job. They executed it with excellence. That was not a crime then. It is not a crime now. We look forward to Mr. McDavid’s exoneration.”
How will the Illinois case differ from New York's?
The trial is one in a series of federal and state cases stacked against Kelly across three states: New York, Illinois and Minnesota.
He was was convicted last year and sentenced to 30 years in prison in June in a federal court in New York on nine counts of racketeering and sex trafficking. Jurors in that case found that Kelly set up a criminal enterprise that enabled him to recruit and transport underage girls for sex. An attorney for Kelly said he will appeal.
While the New York case, according to evidence and testimony presented in court, centered on racketeering charges and allegations that Kelly, his bodyguards, drivers, managers and others developed a decades-long scheme that resulted in the sexual abuse of young fans, the Illinois trial will focus on conduct during prior legal proceedings and video tapes allegedly made by Kelly that constituted child pornography.
In many ways this case will be a do-over of the 2008 trial, which had several key elements missing, said Micheal Leonard, a Chicago trial lawyer who worked briefly on Kelly’s defense team in 2020 for both the New York and Illinois indictments before withdrawing last year.
“This case is more centered on things that happened in the past, particularly with regard to the prior legal proceedings in state court in Illinois,’’ he said. “The government has a theory in this case that there was a cover-up or interference with his former trial and state court years and years ago, which is quite different from what they were doing in New York.”
In 2008, Kelly was tried in Cook County on child pornography charges. The trial centered on a 26-minute videotape sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun-Times in 2002 that allegedly showed Kelly performing sex acts with an underage girl. NBC News has not viewed the videotape.
However, the girl who purportedly appeared in the tape refused to testify at that trial, which jurors said made it difficult for them to convict Kelly.
The same video is in question again, with federal prosecutors now saying Kelly and his co-defendants “agreed to pay money and caused money to be paid on Kelly’s behalf to victims, witnesses, and others to ensure that they would not cooperate with law enforcement and would conceal and cover up evidence, including videos, relating to Kelly’s sexual contact and sexual acts with minors,” according to court filings. Kelly has denied any wrongdoing. His attorneys have not responded to a request for comment.
Filings also allege that McDavid and Brown “agreed to intimidate, threaten, pressure, persuade, and attempt to persuade” the underage girls and their families at Kelly’s behest.
Leonard said testimony from the alleged victim in that case, who is expected to testify this time around, will be the crux of this case.
“Now, you have a person who says, ‘Hey, I really was the victim back then,’” he said.
Trial follows years of allegations against Kelly
Activists have long called for Kelly to face charges related to the long history of sexual abuse allegations against him.
Kenyette Tisha Barnes, who co-founded the #MuteRKelly social media campaign, a grassroots effort to pressure major streaming music services to remove Kelly’s discography from their platforms, said she believes the Illinois prosecution is important because it “illustrates the egregiousness and recklessness of his crimes spanning decades and states. In order for the survivors to heal, we have to make sure that every survivor has their day in court.”
She hopes that the city of Chicago can likewise “start to heal … as people in Chicago who have been systemically silenced have their day.”
“R. Kelly was an architect of the cultural scene in Chicago for three decades. Yes, he influenced the music and culture of South Chicago, which is predominantly African American. But there are other artists who also had impact, only they’re not sexual predators,” she said.
The #MuteRKelly movement notched a partial victory when YouTube removed his official artist channels in October 2021.
Jim DeRogatis, 57, was one of the first journalists who started reporting on the sexual abuse allegations against R. Kelly in the year 2000, first for the Chicago Sun-Times and later for BuzzFeed News.
DeRogatis said he believes it is important for R. Kelly to face justice in Chicago.
He said he hopes that this trial forces a “reckoning in Chicago,” because “every system in Chicago failed dozens of young Black girls for years” and “aside from the Chicago Sun-Times, the media ignored this story for too long.”
He expressed dismay over R. Kelly’s continued popularity in some circles as well as the pro-R. Kelly activity on social media and beyond: “The social media hatred I get is nothing compared to what R. Kelly’s victims get, but it’s still unprecedented and very disturbing.”",2022-08-14T09:00:00Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News

Vermeend slachtoffer getuigt in misbruikzaak tegen R. Kelly,"Een van de vermeende slachtoffers van R. Kelly zal getuigen in de misbruikzaak tegen de zanger die maandag van start gaat in Chicago. Dat melden Amerikaanse media.
Het is de eerste keer dat de vrouw, die nu in de 30 is, zal praten over het vermeende wangedrag van de 55-jarige Kelly. In de rechtszaak zal ook een video worden vertoond waarop zij en de zanger samen te zien zouden zijn. Volgens de openbaar aanklagers heeft Kelly ""honderden keren"" seks met haar gehad toen ze nog minderjarig was.
De desbetreffende video werd in een eerdere rechtszaak in 2008 ook al vertoond. De zanger werd toen vrijgesproken van alle aanklachten wegens kinderporno. Volgens de openbaar aanklagers kwam dat onder meer doordat Kelly destijds de vermeende slachtoffers had gemanipuleerd en betaald om niet de getuigen. Daarmee zou hij de ""rechtsgang hebben belemmerd"". Dat is dan ook een van de aanklachten die aan bod komen tijdens de zaak in Chicago.
Seksueel misbruik
Kelly staat in Chicago ook terecht voor meerdere aanklachten van seksueel misbruik van minderjarigen en voor onder meer het vervaardigen van kinderporno. Eind juni werd Kelly in New York al schuldig bevonden voor onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken. De zanger, die al sinds 2019 vastzit, werd veroordeeld tot een celstraf van dertig jaar.

Insgesamt ist Kelly in 13 Punkten angeklagt: Unter anderem wegen der Herstellung von Kinderpornografie in mehreren Fällen, der Verleitung Minderjähriger zu sexuellen Handlungen und Behinderung der Justiz. Auch zwei frühere Angestellte von ihm sind angeklagt.
Dabei geht es auch um ein bereits viele Jahre bekanntes Video, dass Kelly (55) zeigen soll, wie er ein 14-jähriges Mädchen missbraucht und auf sie uriniert. In diesem Fall war der Musiker 2008 von einer Jury bereits freigesprochen worden. Die Staatsanwaltschaft wird ihm nun aber vor, das Opfer unter Druck gesetzt zu haben, damit diese nicht in dem Prozess aussagt.
In der nun anstehenden Gerichtsverhandlung soll die mittlerweile volljährige Frau aber aussagen. Es wird damit gerechnet, dass der Prozess einen Monat dauern könnte. Ihm droht erneut eine jahrzehntelange Haftstrafe.
Anschuldigugen blieben lange unbeachtet – MeToo brachte alles ins Rollen
Der «I believe I can fly»-Sänger war Ende Juni in New York in einem Missbrauchsprozess zu einer Haftstrafe von 30 Jahren und einer Geldbusse von 100 000 Dollar verurteilt worden. Bereits im vergangenen Jahr hatte eine Jury den Musiker nach mehrwöchigem Prozess in allen neun Anklagepunkten - darunter sexuelle Ausbeutung Minderjähriger, Kidnapping und Bestechung - für schuldig befunden. Kelly hatte die Vorwürfe stets zurückgewiesen. Er sitzt seit Sommer 2019 im Gefängnis.
Das Verfahren ist - nach Fällen wie denen von Filmproduzent Harvey Weinstein und Komiker Bill Cosby - eine weitere viel beachtete juristische Aufarbeitung in der MeToo-Ära. Erste Anschuldigungen gegen den 1967 in Chicago als Robert Sylvester Kelly geborenen Musiker wurden bereits vor rund 25 Jahren bekannt.
Doch der Musik-Koloss schien unangreifbar auf seinem Pop-Thron und blieb lange Zeit auf freiem Fuss. Mit mehr als 50 Millionen verkauften Alben, mehreren Grammys und anderen Auszeichnungen gehörte er zu den erfolgreichsten Musikern des späten 20. Jahrhunderts.

R. Kelly’s Chicago federal trial begins Monday,"When Chicago-born R&B star R. Kelly walked out of the Cook County criminal courthouse a free man in 2008, it wasn’t just a stroke of luck.
Kelly’s stunning acquittal on child pornography charges nearly a decade and a half ago was the result of a carefully crafted strategy by a team of veteran Chicago criminal defense attorneys, who employed nearly every street-fight tactic in the 26th and California legal playbook.

Bury the court with paper. Delay the proceedings for years. Dirty up every witness you can. And when it comes to the prosecutors’ smoking gun, a videotape allegedly showing Kelly sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl, relentlessly question its authenticity — and keep the victim on your side.
Kelly is going on trial again in Chicago, this time at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, where the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer stands accused of conspiring to rig the Cook County trial years ago by paying off the victim on the now-infamous videotape.

Also facing trial are Kelly’s former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, who, according to the indictment, schemed to buy back incriminating sex tapes that had been taken from Kelly’s collection and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.
The trial, which gets underway with jury selection Monday, comes on the heels of Kelly’s federal racketeering case in New York, which involved similar allegations of sexual misconduct and resulted in a guilty verdict and 30-year sentence levied in June.

With the 55-year-old Kelly already facing what could be the rest of his life behind bars, some observers argued whether it makes sense to spend so many public resources to try Kelly again. Kelly also faces four pending cases in Cook County, which have largely been on hold since the federal indictments were revealed.
Sources said there were initial discussions of a plea deal earlier in the proceedings, but with Kelly appealing both his conviction and sentence in New York, they never really got off the ground.
Now, the trial about to unfold in Chicago seems ripe for intrigue. For one, Kelly’s new criminal defense attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, is a veteran litigator who relishes taking on what she portrays as an unchecked and overzealous government, representing controversial clients such as actor Bill Cosby and Gangster Disciples boss Larry Hoover.

McDavid, meanwhile, is represented by Chicago attorneys Beau Brindley and Vadim Glozman, who have shown in a flurry of pretrial motions that they intend to aggressively fight the charges, even if it means potentially throwing Kelly under the bus. Brown’s lawyer, Mary Judge, is also well-respected and a 25-year veteran of the Federal Public Defender’s Office in Chicago.

At the center of the trial is U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber, who at 85 is one of the senior statesmen of Chicago’s federal bench, with a well-worn reputation for fairness, an acute knowledge of the law and a fairly low tolerance for nonsense.
At a pretrial conference earlier this month, Leinenweber signaled he intends to run a tight ship, in part because the large ceremonial courtroom where the trial is being held is in high demand due to COVID-19 protocols still in place in the building. He said he wants to keep time-consuming sidebars to a minimum, and if a lawyer from either side tests positive for COVID-19, their colleagues will have to pick up the slack.

“We’re going to get it done in four weeks come hell or high water,” Leinenweber said. “I have a reputation of moving a case along.”
Not an easy legal climb
Winning an acquittal is always an uphill battle in Chicago’s federal court, where the U.S. attorney’s office has a nearly perfect record when it comes to celebrities, politicians or other high-profile defendants.
But Kelly’s path to victory could be even more unlikely, given that the evidence for the child pornography charges is significantly stronger than it was when Kelly was first indicted in Cook County in 2002.
Prosecutors are expected to present to jurors four videotapes depicting Kelly having sex with a minor — not just one. But potentially far more damaging to Kelly is that the girl depicted on the tapes, who refused to testify in 2008, is now cooperating with law enforcement, as is her mother.
The victim, now in her mid-30s, is expected to identify herself on the videos, and both she and her mother are expected to testify about efforts by Kelly and his team to keep them quiet — including flying the family to the Bahamas and Mexico and giving her father, who was a bassist in Kelly’s band, checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Steven Greenberg, who was Kelly’s chief attorney until a rift in the defense team prompted him to leave the federal cases in 2021, told the Tribune in an interview last week that Kelly enjoyed “the super-presumption of innocence” in his trial in 2008, when he was still a famous musician with a string of recent hits.

But the public’s view of Kelly has changed significantly since then, starting with the #MeToo-era docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” and ending with his high-profile trial in New York, which featured testimony from nearly a dozen victims of his alleged sexual and psychological abuse.
”Jurors are human, and while they say they can decide the case based on the evidence in the courtroom, anyone that claims they haven’t heard anything about R. Kelly is probably lying,” Greenberg said. “And anyone who says they don’t have some opinion about R. Kelly is probably lying.”
Bonjean posted to Twitter on Friday that it will be “difficult to find 12 people who can be fair given the media war on my client.”
“The government starts with an incredible advantage but we are going to fight like hell to get a jury that will follow the law,” she wrote.
Greenberg said the trial will likely pit the three defendants against each other, with McDavid trying to pin any wrongdoing on Kelly and his lawyers at the time “who orchestrated it.”
“And Kelly is going to say, if anything, it was McDavid and the lawyers,” Greenberg said.

When Kelly’s first criminal trial was unfolding in 2008, rumors abounded about the location of the alleged victim on the videotape, who was actually a potential witness for the defense. Behind the scenes, it was known that the girl had been living at Kelly’s south suburban mansion. She’d even been taken shopping for something to wear on the stand by the wife of an attorney on Kelly’s legal team. But she was never called to testify.
Dick Devine, who headed the Cook County state’s attorney’s office back then, told the Tribune his team strongly suspected at the time that the young victim and her family were being “taken care of” to keep them from cooperating, but they could not prove it.
”We did try to figure out what was going on and see if there were any links we could establish,” he said in an interview last week. “But as you can imagine, the people involved did not want to cooperate at all, and did not. So we reached dead ends in many of the things we were pursuing.”
The prosecution team was “very frustrated” that the central witness and her parents were not in place, Devine said. But he said “they did their best, they tried a good case, but it simply wasn’t enough in light of the gaps that were there, at least according to the jury.”
Devine said that they brought the case knowing it would be tough to win, and at one point rejected an offer from Kelly’s camp to have him plead guilty and get a slap on the wrist.
The trial, he said, was “kind of a slugfest day to day,” with the throngs of R. Kelly fans outside the courthouse, the aggressive moves from his defense team, and the strong suspicions of witness tampering.

”It’s part of our legal history, and I don’t think the best part, but one we’re living with,” Devine said.
Details of the case
The federal charges Kelly is now facing fall into two overlapping categories. Some allege he repeatedly molested underage girls and would make videotapes of their sex acts. The obstruction charges allege that, when he got wind that authorities were investigating, he bought back incriminating tapes and paid off witnesses so they wouldn’t cooperate with law enforcement.
According to a recent prosecution filing, the evidence will span a 23-year period from 1991 to 2014, when Kelly rose to the height of his fame before becoming the butt of late-night comics’ jokes.
Jurors are expected to hear evidence about four videos made by Kelly during that time depicting him sexually abusing an underage girl: his goddaughter from the original tape, who is identified in the charges only as Minor 1. Other witnesses are also expected to testify that Kelly had sexual contact with them when they were underage, and that he often taped those encounters as well.

Some of the evidence the jury is expected to hear is well-documented territory in Kelly’s history of sexual conduct: The tripods and camcorders at his recording studios, tour buses and hotel rooms; the gym bag of VHS tapes containing child pornography he allegedly carried around; the threats of civil suits followed by nondisclosure settlements.
Prosecutors allege that beginning in 2001, Kelly and his entourage became aware of multiple videos missing from Kelly’s “collection” and that he and McDavid orchestrated a scheme of payoffs to get them back and keep others quiet about Kelly’s relationship with Minor 1.

In addition to Minor 1, two other women who were underage at the time of the alleged conspiracy are expected to testify that Kelly struck up a sexual relationship with Minor 1 when she was as young as 13 and videotaped himself assaulting her in his home, at his studios, on tour buses and in hotel rooms.
In one video that jurors are expected to see, Kelly is having sex with Minor 1 at his home on George Street in Chicago while she is wearing a “distinctive” necklace — the same necklace that she is wearing in a passport photo taken about the same time, according to prosecutors.
In the early 2000s, Chicago police attempted to locate Minor 1 for questioning but Kelly’s team had her flown to the Bahamas and Mexico for weeks to get away from law enforcement, according to prosecutors.
When they returned to Chicago, Kelly’s team “isolated” Minor 1 from her family, monitoring her phone calls and moving her around to different hotels, according to prosecutors. That lasted until her parents agreed to deny that it was Minor 1 on the videotape, prosecutors said.
Another woman, identified as Minor 5, is expected to testify that Kelly began having sexual contact with her when she was 14 or 15. He would often tape their sex acts, as well as sex acts involving her and other underage girls, according to prosecutors.

When police began to investigate the videotape in late 2001, Minor 5 initially identified Minor 1 as the girl on the footage. But later on, Kelly persuaded her to lie to the grand jury and say she did not know of any sexual relationship between Kelly and Minor 1, according to prosecutors.
After her first sexual contact with Kelly, Minor 5 is expected to testify that he told her: “We all have secrets now.”
Trial drama expected
However the evidence shakes out, Kelly’s trial is the most high-profile event at the typically buttoned-down Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in the 2 ½ years since the onset of the pandemic.
Kelly’s die-hard followers — some who live-tweet events in his case and post social media videos that garner millions of views — are expected to show up in droves to support him, just like they did at his first Cook County trial and his Brooklyn trial.

And the scenes could be just as theatrical inside the courtroom. Recent weeks have seen a flood of pretrial motions, each seemingly more bombastic than the last.

Prosecutors want to bar Kelly’s defense from presenting expert testimony that Kelly has an IQ of about 79, saying his alleged intellectual deficiencies are irrelevant to whether he videotaped himself molesting underage girls. Kelly’s defense wants to prohibit prosecutors from calling an expert witness to testify about child sex abuse and grooming.

Most dramatically, perhaps, McDavid’s legal team has argued in a series of strongly worded motions that prosecutors botched the chain of custody for the key videotape involving Minor 1, and accused the former lead prosecutor on the case, Angel Krull, of having inappropriate contact with the alleged victim as well as Jim DeRogatis, the Chicago journalist whose reporting decades ago was the first to bring the accusations against Kelly to light.
Krull, it has been revealed, communicated with DeRogatis using a burner email account under the alias “Demetrius Slovenski” and the username piedpiper312, a reference to one of Kelly’s own nicknames for himself. In text messages in 2019, Krull had Minor 1 stored in her contacts under the name “Boss Baby,” at one point telling the woman that a pregnancy photo of her is “beautiful and glowing.”
As of Friday evening, Leinenweber had made no rulings on the pending requests.

R. Kelly headed back to court 14 years later for sex assault of teen girl,"Fourteen years after a jury shockingly acquitted R. Kelly in a high-profile child porn case, prosecutors will get a second crack at the disgraced Grammy winner.
The 55-year-old R&B singer is slated to appear in federal court in Chicago on Monday to begin what in many ways is a do-over of his 2008 state trial, where shocking video he took of himself sexually assaulting and urinating on a 14-year-old girl was prosecutors’ “Exhibit 1.”
However, this time around, the victim is expected to testify.
Among the most serious charges R. Kelly faces is conspiracy to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial, including by paying off and threatening the victim to make sure she did not testify.
The fallen “I Believe I Can Fly” singer and icon of ’90s pop stardom was slapped with 30 years in prison in June by a Brooklyn federal judge for a 2021 conviction on charges he sexually abused women and underage girls and boys over the course of decades.
Testimony by the 2008 victim, now in her 30s and referred to in court filings only as “Minor 1,” is expected to be crucial.
Kelly will also be on trial for allegedly enticing four others to have sex with him when they were minors. All are also expected to testify.

More convictions could add decades to Kelly’s Brooklyn sentence, which he is appealing.
Prosecutors at the federal trial in Chicago plan to play the same VHS tape that was prominently exhibited at the 2008 trial. At least three other videos will be entered into evidence.

R. Kelly's Fiancée Says She Is Carrying Imprisoned Singer's Child,"Just before R. Kelly was sentenced to prison for 30 years after being found guilty of sex crimes and racketeering charges, he and Joycelyn Savage got engaged. Despite Savage's claims that she loved Kelly and supported him, her family had doubts that the engagement was real. ""she never made the engagement known to the family, and they've never even spoken about the possibility beforehand,"" said the family's attorney.
Now, Savage says that she is carrying R. Kelly's baby. In her new tell all book which was obtained by the New York Post, Savage described the discovery of her pregnancy. ""I began expecting severe morning sickness and was unsure what was wrong with my body. I thought I had contracted COVID-19, but the most amazing news of all was that I was expecting,"" she writes in the book, called Love and Joy of Robert.
""It was a happy day but an incomplete time in my life,"" she continues. ""Today I am grateful to God for giving me the most precious gift. Robert is extremely excited about the news that I am having a baby and feels sad that Robert will not be able to be here with us.""
In an interview with the Post, Savage said that Kelly agreed for her to share a photo of their child's ultrasound. She also added that he had read the book and approved its publication. ""Robert approved the book and his team has read it through. I wanted pictures of us at concerts, at his house, and lying down together. I told them I wanted exactly what happened,"" Savage said. ""However, there were moments I didn’t include in this book because I wanted to have a happy ending and story with Robert. I live in one of Robert’s condos and am working on my next book, which will reveal a lot about him that has been tampered by the media. Many secrets.""
Savage is currently living in one of the R&B singer's condos.

R. Kelly Accuser to Give Key Testimony on Trial-Fixing Charge,"R. Kelly’s federal trial in Chicago that starts Monday (Aug. 15) is in many ways a do-over of his 2008 state child pornography trial, at which jurors acquitted the singer on charges that he produced a video of himself when he was around 30 having sex with a girl no older than 14.

There’s one big difference: This time, prosecutors say, she will testify.
Kelly, 55, goes into Chicago federal court already sentenced by a New York federal judge to a 30-year prison term for a 2021 conviction on charges he parlayed his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Among the most serious charges the Grammy Award winner faces at his federal trial is conspiracy to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial, including by paying off and threatening the girl to ensure she did not testify.
Testimony by the woman, now in her 30s and referred to in filings only as “Minor 1,” will be pivotal. The charges against Kelly also include four counts of the enticement of minors for sex — one count each for four other accusers. All are also slated to testify.
Even just one or two convictions in Chicago could add decades to Kelly’s New York sentence, which he is appealing. With the New York sentence alone, Kelly will be around 80 before qualifying for early release.
Prosecutors at the federal trial plan to play the same VHS tape that was “Exhibit No. 1″ at the 2008 trial. While it was the only video in evidence 14 years ago, at least three other videos will be entered into evidence at the federal trial.
Prosecutors say Kelly shot the video of Minor 1 in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home between 1998 and 2000 when she was as young as 13. In it, the girl is heard calling the man “daddy.” Federal prosecutors say that she and Kelly had sex hundreds of times over the years in his homes, recording studios and tour buses.
Before the 2008 trial, Kelly carried a duffle bag full of sex tapes everywhere he went for years, but some tapes later went missing, according to court filings. In the 2000s, bootleg copies of some videos appeared on street corners across the U.S.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it.
On June 13, 2008, Kelly shut his eyes tight and bowed his head as jurors returned from deliberations. As a court official read the jury’s decision and it became clear Kelly would be acquitted on all counts, tears streamed down his cheeks and he said over and over, “Thank you, Jesus.”
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants in Chicago. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they have also denied any wrongdoing.
Double jeopardy rules bar the prosecution of someone for the same crimes they were acquitted of earlier. But that shouldn’t apply to the Chicago federal trial because prosecutors are alleging different crimes related to Minor 1, including obstruction of justice for fixing the 2008 trial.
Minor 1 first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly’s music. Soon after that meeting, Minor 1 told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
In the early 2000s, the aunt showed the parents a copy of a video she said depicted their daughter having sex with Kelly. When they confronted Kelly, he told them, “You’re with me or against me,” a government filing says.
The parents took it as a threat.
“Minor 1’s mother did not want to go up against Kelly’s power, money, and influence by not following what he said,” the filing adds.
Kelly told the parents and Minor 1 they had to leave Chicago, paying for them to travel to the Bahamas and Cancun, Mexico. When they returned, prosecutors say Kelly sought to isolate Minor 1, moving her around to different hotels.
When called before a state grand jury looking into the video, Minor 1, her father and mother denied it was her in it. Prosecutors say an attorney for Kelly sat in on their testimony and reported back to Kelly what they said.
Prosecutors from the Cook County state’s attorney’s office chose to push ahead with charges and to take the case to trial in 2008 despite what they knew was a major hurdle: their inability to call the girl in the video to testify.
Any confidence Kelly may have had of beating similar charges a second time were likely dashed when he learned Minor 1 was now cooperating with the government. With more resources, federal prosecutors also boast conviction rates of more than 90% compared to around 65% for their state counterparts.
In 2008, his lawyers argued the man in the VHS video who appeared very much to be Kelly was not Kelly. They showed jurors that Kelly has a large mole on his back, then played excerpts of the video in which no mole was visible on the man.
One of Kelly’s attorneys, Sam Adam Jr., told jurors during closings that no mole on the man’s back meant one thing: “It ain’t him. And if it ain’t him, you can’t convict.”
Some 2008 jurors told reporters after the trial that they weren’t convinced the female in the video was who state prosecutors said she was.
That shouldn’t be an issue at the Chicago federal trial. Prosecutors say both the girl and her parents will testify.
What defense Kelly’s legal team will present this time isn’t clear.
The defense is likely to say Kelly’s accusers are misrepresenting the facts. Kelly was more blunt in a 2019 interview with Gayle King of CBS This Morning, saying about the women: “All of them are lying.”",2022-08-13T16:35:00Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
R. Kelly heads back to trial as accuser in alleged child sex video set to testify,"R. Kelly's federal trial in Chicago that starts Monday is in many ways a do-over of his 2008 state child pornography trial, at which jurors acquitted the singer on charges that he produced a video of himself when he was around 30 having sex with a girl no older than 14.
There's one big difference: This time, prosecutors say, she will testify.
Kelly goes into Chicago federal court already sentenced by a New York federal judge to 30-year prison term for a 2021 conviction on charges he parlayed his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Among the most serious charges the Grammy Award winner faces at his federal trial is conspiracy to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial, including by paying off and threatening the girl to ensure she did not testify.
Testimony by the woman, now in her 30s and referred to in filings only as ""Minor 1,"" will be pivotal. The charges against Kelly also include four counts of the enticement of minors for sex — one count each for four other accusers. All are also slated to testify.
Even just one or two convictions in Chicago could add decades to Kelly's New York sentence, which he is appealing. With the New York sentence alone, Kelly will be around 80 before qualifying for early release.
Prosecutors at the federal trial plan to play the same VHS tape that was ""Exhibit No. 1"" at the 2008 trial. While it was the only video in evidence 14 years ago, at least three other videos will be entered into evidence at the federal trial.
Prosecutors say Kelly shot the video of Minor 1 in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home between 1998 and 2000 when she was as young as 13. In it, the girl is heard calling the man ""daddy."" Federal prosecutors say that she and Kelly had sex hundreds of times over the years in his homes, recording studios and tour buses.
Before the 2008 trial, Kelly carried a duffle bag full of sex tapes everywhere he went for years, but some tapes later went missing, according to court filings. In the 2000s, bootleg copies of some videos appeared on street corners across the U.S.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago's South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it.

Kelly goes into Chicago federal court already sentenced by a New York federal judge to 30-year prison term for a 2021 conviction on charges he parlayed his fame to sexually abuse other young fans.
Among the most serious charges the Grammy Award winner faces at his federal trial is conspiracy to obstruct justice by rigging the 2008 trial, including by paying off and threatening the girl to ensure she did not testify.

Testimony by the woman, now in her 30s and referred to in filings only as “Minor 1,” will be pivotal. The charges against Kelly also include four counts of the enticement of minors for sex — one count each for four other accusers. All are also slated to testify.
Even just one or two convictions in Chicago could add decades to Kelly's New York sentence, which he is appealing. With the New York sentence alone, Kelly will be around 80 before qualifying for early release.
Prosecutors at the federal trial plan to play the same VHS tape that was “Exhibit No. 1″ at the 2008 trial. While it was the only video in evidence 14 years ago, at least three other videos will be entered into evidence at the federal trial.
Prosecutors say Kelly shot the video of Minor 1 in a log cabin-themed room at his North Side Chicago home between 1998 and 2000 when she was as young as 13. In it, the girl is heard calling the man “daddy.” Federal prosecutors say that she and Kelly had sex hundreds of times over the years in his homes, recording studios and tour buses.

Before the 2008 trial, Kelly carried a duffle bag full of sex tapes everywhere he went for years, but some tapes later went missing, according to court filings. In the 2000s, bootleg copies of some videos appeared on street corners across the U.S.
Kelly, who rose from poverty on Chicago’s South Side to become a star singer, songwriter and producer, knew a conviction in 2008 would effectively end his life as he knew it.
On June 13, 2008, Kelly shut his eyes tight and bowed his head as jurors returned from deliberations. As a court official read the jury’s decision and it became clear Kelly would be acquitted on all counts, tears streamed down his cheeks and he said over and over, “Thank you, Jesus.”
Two Kelly associates, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, are co-defendants in Chicago. McDavid is accused of helping Kelly fix the 2008 trial, while Brown is charged with receiving child pornography. Like Kelly, they have also denied any wrongdoing.

Double jeopardy rules bar the prosecution of someone for the same crimes they were acquitted of earlier. But that shouldn't apply to the Chicago federal trial because prosecutors are alleging different crimes related to Minor 1, including obstruction of justice for fixing the 2008 trial.
Minor 1 first met Kelly in the late 1990s when she was in junior high school. She had tagged along to Kelly’s Chicago recording studio with her aunt, a professional singer working with Kelly’s music. Soon after that meeting, Minor 1 told her parents Kelly was going to be her godfather.
In the early 2000s, the aunt showed the parents a copy of a video she said depicted their daughter having sex with Kelly. When they confronted Kelly, he told them, “You’re with me or against me,” a government filing says.
The parents took it as a threat.
“Minor 1’s mother did not want to go up against Kelly’s power, money, and influence by not following what he said,” the filing adds.
Ad
Kelly told the parents and Minor 1 they had to leave Chicago, paying for them to travel to the Bahamas and Cancun, Mexico. When they returned, prosecutors say Kelly sought to isolate Minor 1, moving her around to different hotels.
When called before a state grand jury looking into the video, Minor 1, her father and mother denied it was her in it. Prosecutors say an attorney for Kelly sat in on their testimony and reported back to Kelly what they said.
Prosecutors from the Cook County state’s attorney’s office chose to push ahead with charges and to take the case to trial in 2008 despite what they knew was a major hurdle: their inability to call the girl in the video to testify.
Any confidence Kelly may have had of beating similar charges a second time were likely dashed when he learned Minor 1 was now cooperating the government. With more resources, federal prosecutors also boast conviction rates of more than 90% compared to around 65% for their state counterparts.
Ad
In 2008, his lawyers argued the man in the VHS video who appeared very much to be Kelly was not Kelly. They showed jurors that Kelly has a large mole on his back, then played excerpts of the video in which no mole was visible on the man.
One of Kelly’s attorneys, Sam Adam Jr., told jurors during closings that no mole on the man's back meant one thing: “It ain’t him. And if it ain’t him, you can’t convict.”
Some 2008 jurors told reporters after the trial that they weren’t convinced the female in the video was who state prosecutors said she was.
That shouldn’t be an issue at the Chicago federal trial. Prosecutors say both the girl and her parents will testify.
What defense Kelly’s legal team will present this time isn’t clear.
The defense is likely to say Kelly’s accusers are misrepresenting the facts. Kelly was more blunt in a 2019 interview with Gayle King of “CBS This Morning,” saying about the women: “All of them are lying.”

R. Kelly: Seine Verlobte verkündet Schwangerschaft - doch der Rapper bestreitet das,"Die Geschichte zwischen Sänger R. Kelly und seiner Verlobten wird immer seltsamer. Nun sei Joycelyn Savage schwanger – doch wie soll das möglich sein?
Die Missbrauchsvorwürfe gegen den Sänger R. Kelly (55) standen Jahrzehntelang im Raum – am 29. Juni 2022 ist er schließlich in New York zu einer Freiheitsstrafe von 30 Jahren verurteilt worden. Seine Verlobte Joycelyn Savage (26), die selbst eines seiner Missbrauchsopfer war und im Prozess 2019 noch gegen ihn ausgesagt hatte, veröffentlichte nun ein Buch, in dem sie behauptet, von R. Kelly schwanger zu sein.
Im dritten Monat schwanger? R. Kelly ist seit über einem Jahr in Haft Die Crux an der Sache: Nach Angaben von ""tmz.com"" sei sie erst im dritten Monat – und der Sänger bereits seit über einem Jahr in Haft. Über den Hintergrund, wie es zur Zeugung des Kindes gekommen sein soll, schweigt Joycelyn Savage. Unterdessen bestreitet der ehemalige R&B-Star, dass er der Vater sein soll. Die Reaktionen auf R. Kellys Schuldspruch, der für ihn 30 Jahre ins Gefängnis bringt, seht ihr im Video.

Anwältin von R. Kelly bestreitet angebliche Vaterschaft auf Twitter In einem Tweet stellt Kellys Anwältin, Jennifer Bonjean, klar: ""Es ist nicht wahr, dass Joy eine Enthüllungsgeschichte veröffentlicht, und sie ist sicherlich nicht mit R. Kellys Kind schwanger. Die Leute sind einfach verrückt.""
In ihrem Buch ""Love and Joy of Robert"" berichtet Joycelyn Savage auch, wie froh ihr Verlobter über die angebliche Schwangerschaft sei: ""[Er ist] sehr begeistert über die Neuigkeiten!"" Er wünsche sich außerdem, dass er bei der Geburt des Kindes dabei sein könne.
Brief an Richterin: Verlobung von R. Kelly und Joycelyn Savage wird bekannt Die 26-Jährige, die den Rapper mit gerade einmal 17 Jahren kennenlernte, macht ihre angebliche Schwangerschaft in einem Buch öffentlich. Auch die Verlobung von R. Kelly und Joycelyn Savage wurde auf ungewöhnlichem Weg bekannt: Während des Prozesses schrieb sie einen Brief an die Richterin, um auf eine milde Strafe zu plädieren. Zuvor war nichts über ihre Verlobung bekannt.",2022-08-13T13:03:13Z,https://www.bunte.de,BUNTE.de
"R. Kelly im Knast, Verlobte erwartet Baby: Verwirrung um Schwangerschaft","Joycelyn Savage soll schwanger sein, angeblich von R. Kelly. Der sieht das ein bisschen anders ...
Von: Jula Schreiber
Kann das wirklich sein?
Sie ist nicht nur sein mutmaßliches Opfer und seine Verlobte, sondern eventuell auch schon bald die Mutter seines Kindes.
Sänger R. Kelly (bürgerlich Robert Kelly, 55) sitzt nach seiner Verurteilung im Missbrauchsprozess im Juli dieses Jahres eine 30-jährige Haftstrafe ab. Seine Verlobte Joycelyn Savage (26) hält trotz der Verurteilung wegen zahlreicher Sexual-Verbrechen gegen Minderjährige zu ihm, ist bereits seit ihrem 19. Lebensjahr mit dem Musiker zusammen.
Und nun das: Joycelyn Savage verkündet, dass sie von Kelly schwanger ist!
Bilder in Freiheit wie dieses gehören der Vergangenheit an: Kelly muss für 30 Jahre hinter Gitter
In ihrem Buch „Love and Joy of Robert“ verkündet Savage nicht nur ihre Schwangerschaft, sondern auch die Tatsache, dass sich der Musiker über den gemeinsamen Nachwuchs freuen soll. Außerdem würde sich der verurteilte Künstler angeblich wünschen, bei der Geburt dabei sein zu können.
Die Umstände der vermeintlichen Zeugung bleiben jedoch mysteriös, Savage verrät in ihrem Buch zwar, dass sie im dritten Monat ist, jedoch nicht, wie die Schwangerschaft zustande gekommen sein soll. Schließlich ist der Musiker bereits seit einem Jahr in Haft.
Und R. Kelly? Der will davon nichts wissen und bestreitet eine Vaterschaft!
Kellys Anwältin, Jennifer Bonjean, sagt laut TMZ, Joycelyn sei „ganz sicher nicht mit R. Kellys Kind schwanger“. Außerdem soll Savages Buch keine „Enthüllungsgeschichte sein. Bonjean fügte hinzu: Die Leute sind einfach verrückt.“
Spätestens in einigen Monaten wird sich herausstellen, wer die Wahrheit sagt: Savage oder Kelly
Während Savages Eltern übrigens eine „Gehirnwäsche“ bei ihrer Tochter als den Grund sehen, wieso sie immer noch mit Kelly zusammen ist, hält die 26-Jährige immer noch fest zu ihrem Verlobten.
Erst kurz vor seiner Verurteilung diesen Sommer schrieb sie einen Brief an das Gericht, in dem sie ihre Verlobung öffentlich machte und verkündete: „Ich bin nicht das Opfer, als das mich die Regierung dargestellt hat.“",2022-08-13T12:15:44Z,https://www.bild.de,BILD

"R. Kelly's Lawyer Says Joycelyn Savage Is Not Pregnant: ""People Are Just Insane""","These days, the last thing R. Kelly needs is more drama, but this latest revelation has caused a ruckus. Kelly's legal team has been battling the courts in desperate attempts to help the disgraced singer reclaim his freedom, and as they work tirelessly, a new report surfaced that Kelly's alleged girlfriend Joycelyn Savage was pregnant with his child.
Savage gained notoriety when she was featured alongside Azriel Clary in Kelly's infamous interview with Gayle King. The two young women were both girlfriends of Kelly at the time, and they denied any and all allegations of sex crimes against the singer.

While Clary has decided to move on and leave her days with Kelly behind, Savage has stuck by his side through his trials—and his guilty verdict. Earlier today (August 12), we reported on the news that Savage was allegedly releasing a tell-all book that detailed her life with the Grammy winner. Inside, she allegedly wrote that she was pregnant with his child.
“I thought I had contracted COVID-19, but the most amazing news of all was that I was expecting. It was a happy day but an incomplete time in my life. Today I am grateful to God for giving me the most precious gift. Robert is extremely excited about the news that I am having a baby and feels sad that Robert will not be able to be here with us.”
After TMZ share snippets of the book, Kelly's lawyer released a statement to the outlet denying Savage's claims. Attorney Jennifer Bonjean reportedly told them that Savage ""is certainly not pregnant with R. Kelly's child,"" adding that Savage's book was not a tell-all. ""People are just insane.""
It was also rumored that Savage was engaged to R. Kelly, but that has yet to be confirmed.

Joycelyn Savage Alleges She’s Carrying Fiancé R. Kelly’s Baby In New Tell-All Book,"Even from behind bars, R. Kelly’s name continues to be linked to troubling reports regarding his past victims – most notably, his alleged fiancée, Jocelyn Savage, is claiming in a new book that she’s pregnant with the disgraced R&B singer’s child. As the NY Post reports, the 26-year-old published her 11-page tell-all on Friday (August 12), detailing how her relationship with the sex offender came to be.
Prior to meeting Kelly, Savage described her life as “emotionally and mentally draining,” also claiming that she was sexually abused at the hands of family members.
Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images
“Family members touching you despite knowing you were aware of the situation felt as if it was okay for them to do so,” she wrote. “It felt normal to me that I was unable to voice my feelings to my parents when all they did was ignore my pain.”
Jonjelyn and Timothy Savage, Joycelyn’s parents, have made it public knowledge that they don’t approve of their daughter’s relationship with the Chicago native, even participating in interviews for the damning Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning docuseries.
The rumoured mother-to-be recalled the night she met Kelly, at just 19 years old. She was “eager to catch Robert’s attention” while attending his concert, hoping to be one of the girls that made it backstage to get closer to the artist. Her dreams came true, at which time the “Ignition” singer “[put] his hand on [her] hip, [gripped her] butt, and [called her] beautiful and various flattering names.”

That same night, Joycelyn sang for 55-year-old, and he and his friends declared that they had “found the next Aaliyah.” He urged her to move into his Atlanta house so that he could assist with her music career, and although she was interested, she still wanted to keep up with her studies.
“He responded, ‘Daddy has everything you need right here.’ He pulled out a stack of cash. I wasn’t concerned about the money at the time; I just wanted to improve my music,” Savage shared. “I was always persuaded by him with money, saying I should not leave because this is an opportunity that no one else will ever have and if I leave I’ll regret it.”
The 26-year-old went on to detail the “kinky” sexual acts that Kelly convinced her to engage in afterward, as well as the other “strangely young” girls she would see backstage at shows while touring with the artist. Eventually, another girl joined in on their relationship, and the embattled creative would make them be intimate with each other while he watched, or even filmed.
Elsewhere, Savage shared that she found out about her pregnancy “months after” the songwriter sent an engagement ring to her home following his sentencing. “I began [experiencing] severe morning sickness and was unsure what was wrong with my body,” she wrote.
“I thought I had contracted COVID-19, but the most amazing news of all was that I was expecting. It was a happy day but an incomplete time in my life. Today I am grateful to God for giving me the most precious gift. Robert is extremely excited about the news that I am having a baby and feels sad that Robert will not be able to be here with us.”

Verloofde R. Kelly claimt zwanger te zijn,"Joycelyn Savage, de verloofde van R. Kelly, is in verwachting. Dat claimt ze althans in haar vrijdag uitgekomen boek Love and Joy of Robert.
De 26-jarige vrouw ontdekte het nieuws in juni, een dag nadat Kelly werd veroordeeld tot dertig jaar cel en enkele maanden nadat de gevallen ster haar een verlovingsring had opgestuurd. ""Ik kreeg last van ernstige ochtendmisselijkheid en wist niet zeker wat er met mijn lichaam aan de hand was"", zo staat volgens Page Six in het elf pagina's tellende boekje. ""Ik dacht dat ik corona had maar het bleek dat ik in verwachting ben.""
Volgens Savage is Kelly, die al drie kinderen heeft uit een eerder huwelijk, inmiddels op de hoogte en is hij ""enorm blij"" met het vooruitzicht weer vader te worden. ""Maar hij voelt zich ook verdrietig dat hij niet bij ons kan zijn.""
De woordvoerder van Kelly heeft nog niet gereageerd op de claim van Savage. Het is ook onduidelijk hoe ver de vrouw in haar zwangerschap is. Volgens Page Six wil ze later een tweede deel van haar memoires schrijven.
Kelly zit al sinds 2019 vast. Hij werd in juni in de staat New York schuldig bevonden aan onder meer het leiden van een organisatie die als doel had vrouwen en minderjarige meisjes te misbruiken. Eerder werd hij al schuldig bevonden aan vrijheidsberoving en dwangarbeid. Er staan hem ook nog zaken in Illinois en Minnesota te wachten.",2022-08-12T21:06:41Z,https://www.welingelichtekringen.nl,Welingelichte Kringen
R. Kelly’s Fiancee Jocelyn Savage Claims She’s Pregnant In New Book,"R. Kelly’s fiancée Jocelyn Savage revealed that she’s pregnant in her new tell-all book Love and Joy of Robert, which was released on Amazon on Friday, August 12. Towards the end of the very short book, Jocelyn claimed that she was expecting the singer’s child, as he serves his 30-year prison sentence on sex trafficking and racketeering charges.
Jocelyn announced her pregnancy in a chapter titled “Bundle of Joy,” where she also wrote about receiving her engagement ring from Kelly’s team. “Months later, I began experiencing severe morning sickness and was unsure what was wrong with my body. I thought I had contracted COVID-19, but the most amazing news of all was that I was expecting.”
As the singer (whose birth name is Robert Sylvester Kelly) serves his sentence, Jocelyn admitted that he’s disappointed he won’t be there to see his child’s birth. “Robert is extremely excited about the news that I’m having a baby and feels sad that Robert won’t be here with us,” she wrote. On the following page, Jocelyn included an ultrasound photo and quotes about joy.
The other chapters of the very short memoir focused on other aspects of her relationship with Kelly, including first meeting him when she was invited backstage at one of his concerts. She also said that she was planning on releasing a follow-up to the book next year, in the description on Amazon.
Kelly was sentenced back at the end of June, after being found guilty on nine counts of sex abuse and racketeering. A number of his victims spoke up in court before he was given 30 years in prison. Before he was sentenced, Jocelyn wrote a letter to Judge Ann Donnelly where she claimed to be the singer’s fiancée. Jocelyn wrote lovingly about the singer and asked her to consider her letter when sentencing him. “Robert is not the monster that the government has described him to be. The Robert I know is very sweet, gentle, and kind,” she wrote.",2022-08-12T20:28:31Z,https://hollywoodlife.com,HollywoodLife
R. Kelly's fiancée Joycelyn Savage is pregnant,"R. Kelly’s fiancée Joycelyn Savage claims she’s pregnant, one of several bombshell revelations in her shocking new book “Love and Joy of Robert.”
The 26-year-old mother-to-be writes in her tiny tell-all — only 11 pages and out Friday on Amazon — that she found out she was expecting months after disgraced R&B singer-songwriter Robert Sylvester Kelly sent an engagement ring to her home, the day after he was sentenced to 30 years in prison for racketeering and sex trafficking.
“Months later, I began expecting severe morning sickness and was unsure what was wrong with my body. I thought I had contracted COVID-19, but the most amazing news of all was that I was expecting,” Savage writes in the book.
“It was a happy day but an incomplete time in my life. Today I am grateful to God for giving me the most precious gift. Robert is extremely excited about the news that I am having a baby and feels sad that Robert will not be able to be here with us.”
Savage told The Post a photograph of the ultrasound was the only image Kelly would clear for publication in the new exposé.
“Yes, Robert approved the book and his team has read it through. I wanted pictures of us at concerts, at his house, and lying down together. I told them I wanted exactly what happened,” she said. “However, there were moments I didn’t include in this book because I wanted to have a happy ending and story with Robert. I live in one of Robert’s condos and am working on my next book, which will reveal a lot about him that has been tampered by the media. Many secrets.”
The Post has contacted reps for Kelly for comment. It remains unclear how far along Savage is in the pregnancy.
“Robert is extremely excited about the news that I am having a baby and feels sad that Robert will not be able to be here with us,” Joycelyn Savage wrote in the book. Joycelyn Savage/Instagram
Savage also told The Post that there will be a second volume of her memoir released next year — and she’s still “hoping for him to be released and prepare for new beginnings.”

The short, yet jaw-dropping read is Savage’s version of the events leading to her living with the troubled R&B singer. She wrote that life prior to meeting Kelly at 19 years old was emotionally and mentally draining, and alleged that “family members” touched her.
“Family members touching you despite knowing you were aware of the situation felt as if it was okay for them to do so,” Savage wrote. “It felt normal to me that I was unable to voice my feelings to my parents when all they did was ignore my pain.”
Savage’s parents, Jonjelyn and Timothy, have been publicly pleading for their daughter to leave Kelly. They were interviewed in-depth in the six-part tell-all series “Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning” in 2020.
The Post has reached out to the Savage parents’ attorney for comment.
In the book, Savage recalls the night she went to Kelly’s concert at 19 years old. She writes that she was “eager to catch Robert’s attention” and be one of the girls that got backstage. She did, and recalls Kelly “putting his hand on my hip, gripping my butt and calling me beautiful and various flattering names.”
She sang for him that night, and said Kelly brought her to recording studio after the show where “all his friends constantly told him ‘I think you found the next Aaliyah.'”

Savage said Kelly asked her to live with him in Atlanta so he could help with her music career.
“It was a very curious moment for me at the time, but I was cautious nonetheless,” she wrote.
“My answer was ‘yes, but I’m still in college.’ He responded, ‘Daddy has everything you need right here.’ He pulled out a stack of cash. I wasn’t concerned about the money at the time; I just wanted to improve my music,” she wrote.
“I was always persuaded by him with money, saying I should not leave because this is an opportunity that no one else will ever have and I [sic] leave I’ll regret it.”
Savage said she was concerned about missing her college classes, but Kelly convinced her to stay in his guesthouse for three days and write music.

She recalled the time Kelly brought her regular and “very sexy and grown up” outfits to wear since she didn’t have many clothes with her.
“I had no clue why he brought me these whory [sic] outfits, until his assistant informed me that Robert wanted me to wear it for some occasion, which was a Spandex and a see-through bra,” Savage said.
“I didn’t question it, thinking perhaps he wanted me to look cute,” she added.
She claimed that Kelly came into her room that night, sat on her bed and asked “Who’s [sic] Daddy?” and she said “you.”
“And he replied ‘good girl,'” Savage wrote.
She said “kinky” sexual acts followed, which became a nightly routine for the two. Savage said she became “used to it” although one act made her feel “compelled to vomit, but I didn’t.”
“It turned me off, but he bought whatever I wanted if I did that for him,” she explained.
She also revealed the comparisons to Kelly’s first wife, the late Aaliyah, didn’t stop, either.
“As much as he wanted me to become his Aaliyah, he was afraid of losing me, which led to him become extremely demanding, obsessive over me, and [unable] to let me leave his sight at all,” Savage said.

“Robert started to call me ‘his sexy little Aaliyah’ or sometimes just ‘Aaliyah’ but I would have to remind him that I’m Joy,” she wrote.
Savage also claimed Kelly’s team was paid very well and signed NDAs to not speak bad about him or reveal any hidden secrets.
She began touring with Kelly, and said that the girls who would get backstage at his shows were “strangely young.”
“I couldn’t say much about it,” she wrote.
Another younger girl joined Kelly and Savage on tour, and Savage said Kelly had the girls “get nasty” with each other, and would also record the two girls doing things with him.
“After living with Robert for a few months, I didn’t like him for what he turned into, but me and the other girl became closer over time, and I promise to always be there for each other no matter what the scenario, well I thought,” Savage revealed.

She said the other girl “became bi-polar” while living under Kelly’s roof and missed her family terribly. Even when he was sent to jail, Kelly allegedly did not want the girls to split up and live on their own.
Savage said they received daily media training in case they were ever asked to speak about Kelly.

R. Kelly's 'fiancée' writes tell-all book on life in his 'shadow',"R. Kelly’s longtime live-in girlfriend — and now alleged fiancée — Joycelyn Savage is set to release a tell-all book about her relationship with the troubled R&B star.
In an email to The Post, Savage, 26, confirmed the book will be called “Love and Joy of Robert” and “should be published on Saturday.”
“All I can say is that it is about Robert, the beginning of my life in Robert’s shadow, where things began to take off, and where they are currently going,” she wrote about the book’s contents.
Savage would neither confirm nor deny to The Post that she and Kelly — whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly — are engaged.
“Everything will be answered in my book,” she said.
Savage did not reveal whether the book would be self-published or through an established publishing house, or where the tome would be available.

In documents obtained by The Post in July, Savage penned a letter to a federal judge, referring to herself as Kelly’s fiancée and asking that he receive a more lenient sentence for his decades-long sexual abuse of women and underage girls and boys. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in the sex trafficking case.
“I’m writing this letter in support of Robert in advance of his sentencing, so I can explain to the court that I’m not the victim that the government has portrayed me to be.”
She continued to call him an “all-around incredible person” and “not the monster that the government has described him to be.
“Robert and I are deeply in love and it breaks my heart that the government has created a narrative that I’m a victim,” Savage continued. “I’m a grown woman and can speak for myself which is why I wanted to provide this letter to the court.
“He is a great man, with a great heart and deserves to be home with his loved ones who are ready to support him,” she concluded.
Savage would be Kelly’s third marriage. In 1994 he secretly married a then-15-year-old Aaliyah, who later died in a plane crash in 2001. Their illegal marriage was annulled. He later was married to choreographer Andrea Kelly from 1996 to 2009, and the couple had three kids.

Savage’s parents, Jonjelyn and Timothy, have been publicly pleading for their daughter to leave Kelly. They were interviewed in-depth in the six-part tell-all series “Surviving R. Kelly: Part II: The Reckoning” in 2020.
In 2019, Savage posted on Instagram that she would tell “my story,” adding in a follow-up post, “‪I have Partnered up with @Patreon where I will post daily chapters of my story. Things I am going to reveal that was sweared not to see the day of light — by NDA. I am risking my life for many others.”
In her Patreon posts, according to Essence, Savage acknowledged that she was manipulated by Kelly.

She reportedly discussed meeting Kelly when she was 15 at a concert and later dropping out of college to live with him. She claimed that Kelly would tell her, “Baby girl, you are going to be the next Aaliyah.” However, her account has been removed from Patreon.
In July, Kelly was convicted on nine charges, including racketeering and violating the Mann Act, which bars interstate transportation of women and girls for “immoral purposes.”",2022-08-12T00:30:09Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post
"R Kelly: ""Με βίασε εκατοντάδες φορές πριν γίνω 18"", καταγγέλλει μάρτυρας","Μια γυναίκα που βρίσκεται στο επίκεντρο της δεύτερης ομοσπονδιακής δίκης του R. Kelly κατέθεσε ότι ο τραγουδιστής της R&B έκανε σεξ μαζί της ""εκατοντάδες"" φορές πριν γίνει 18 ετών.
Η 37χρονη γυναίκα, γνωστή ως ""Τζέιν"", δήλωσε ότι η ανάρμοστη επαφή με τον Kelly ξεκίνησε όταν ήταν μόλις 13 ετών.
Ο τραγουδιστής δικάζεται στο Σικάγο για παιδική πορνογραφία, παρεμπόδιση της δικαιοσύνης και άλλες κατηγορίες. Οι δικηγόροι του έχουν επιμείνει ότι δεν είναι ""τέρας"" και αξίζει μια δίκαιη δίκη.
Ο Kelly, το πλήρες όνομα του οποίου είναι Robert Sylvester Kelly, αντιμετωπίζει 13 ποινικές κατηγορίες, συμπεριλαμβανομένων της δημιουργίας και λήψης παιδικής πορνογραφίας, της παρεμπόδισης της δικαιοσύνης και της παρακίνησης ανηλίκων σε σεξουαλική δραστηριότητα.
Εκτίει ήδη ποινή φυλάκισης 30 ετών, αφού καταδικάστηκε για εμπορία και εκβιασμό σεξ σε ξεχωριστή δίκη που διεξήχθη πέρυσι στη Νέα Υόρκη.
Η τρέχουσα υπόθεση στηρίζεται σε μεγάλο βαθμό στη μαρτυρία της ""Τζέιν"", μιας από τις γυναίκες που τον κατηγορούν του. Οι εισαγγελείς ισχυρίζονται ότι ο Kelly έφτιαξε τουλάχιστον τέσσερα βίντεο με την Τζέιν, τμήματα των οποίων θα προβληθούν στους ενόρκους.
Στο δικαστήριο την Πέμπτη, η ""Τζέιν"" κατέθεσε ότι ο Kelly έκανε σεξ μαζί της ""αμέτρητες φορές"", ξεκινώντας όταν ήταν 15 ετών. Οι ένορκοι είδαν φωτογραφίες της στο λύκειο για να καταδείξουν πόσο νέα φαινόταν τότε.
Κατά τη διάρκεια της δίωρης κατάθεσής της, η Τζέιν περιέγραψε έναν αριθμό σεξουαλικών επαφών που o Kelly φέρεται να κατέγραψε. Σε ένα βίντεο, ο Kelly εμφανίστηκε να της δίνει χρήματα.
Όταν ρωτήθηκε γιατί, η Τζέιν ισχυρίστηκε ότι ο Kelly πίστευε ότι ""αν αυτό κυκλοφορούσε για κάποιο λόγο, αυτός θα έλεγε ότι ήμουν πόρνη"", σύμφωνα με την Chicago Tribune.
Ένα από τα βίντεο βρέθηκε επίσης στο επίκεντρο μιας ξεχωριστής δίκης του 2008, στην οποία τόσο ο Kelly όσο και η Τζέιν αρνήθηκαν ότι ήταν αυτοί στην ταινία. Ο Kelly τελικά αθωώθηκε για όλες τις κατηγορίες.
Ερωτηθείσα για την προηγούμενη αυτή άρνηση την Πέμπτη, είπε στους ενόρκους ότι ""φοβόταν ότι κάτι κακό θα συνέβαινε στον Ρόμπερτ"", σύμφωνα με το Associated Press.
""Τον προστάτευα"".
Ορισμένοι αναλυτές έχουν χαρακτηρίσει την τρέχουσα δίκη ως επανάληψη της δίκης του 2008, κατά την οποία ο τραγουδιστής αντιμετώπισε 14 κατηγορίες για παιδική πορνογραφία.
Δύο από τους πρώην υπαλλήλους του Kelly αντιμετωπίζουν επίσης κατηγορίες σε αυτή τη δίκη. Ο Derrel McDavid, ο πρώην διευθυντής του, κατηγορείται ότι βοήθησε τον Kelly να στήσει τη δίκη του 2008, ενώ ο Milton Brown κατηγορείται για λήψη παιδικής πορνογραφίας.
Και οι δύο άνδρες έχουν δηλώσει αθώοι.
Κατά τη διάρκεια των εναρκτήριων δηλώσεων νωρίτερα αυτή την εβδομάδα, οι δικηγόροι του Κelly και των δύο πρώην υπαλλήλων απέρριψαν τις κατηγορίες και κάλεσαν τους ενόρκους να δώσουν στον Κέλι μια δίκαιη δίκη παρά την ευρεία προσοχή του κοινού και κατήγγειλαν ένα κλίμα ""δικαιοσύνης του όχλου"" γύρω από την υπόθεση.
Επιπλέον, ισχυρίστηκαν ότι ορισμένοι από αυτούς που αναμένεται να καταθέσουν ήταν ""εγκληματίες"" που τον έχουν προηγουμένως ""εκβιάσει"" και έχουν εξασφαλίσει συμφωνίες ασυλίας από τους εισαγγελείς.",2022-08-10T17:21:00Z,https://www.athensvoice.gr,Athens Voice Online

Federal prosecutors this week shot back against accusations that the former lead prosecutor on the R. Kelly case had inappropriate contact with potential witnesses, saying much of the purportedly suspicious contact between her and a key victim had to do merely with scheduling and logistics.
And attorneys for Kelly co-defendant Derrel McDavid made a fiery response Wednesday, saying they want to call the prosecutor as a trial witness to explain herself under oath.

The filings were the latest in a wide-ranging battery of motions ahead of Kelly’s next trial. Most of the attorneys’ recent requests have yet to be resolved; jury selection begins Monday.
Kelly, 55, was indicted in July 2019 on charges of conspiring with McDavid and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, to rig his 2008 child pornography case in Cook County and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls. The trial is slated to last at least a month.

Among a flurry of other motions filed this week: Prosecutors’ request that the defense be prohibited from calling someone to testify about Kelly’s low IQ. A defense request to bar prosecutors from calling an expert witness in child sexual abuse and grooming. And an allegation by co-defendant McDavid that prosecutors have botched the chain of custody for a central videotape allegedly showing Kelly molesting his young teenage goddaughter.

McDavid’s attorneys caused a splash last week when they said the former lead prosecutor on the case, Angel Krull, had communicated with the goddaughter and Chicago journalist Jim DeRogatis in a “mysterious, clandestine, and totally inappropriate” way.
The goddaughter, who is now an adult, is expected to testify that she was the underage girl on the videos, and that she lied about it to investigators at the behest of Kelly and his associates. Krull left Chicago in 2020 to care for an ailing relative and is no longer handling the Kelly case.
Prosecutors this week released the contents of the text messages between Krull and the woman, who is identified only as Minor 1. The vast majority of them have to do with scheduling times and places to meet up and have discussions. One personal text, in which Krull tells the woman that a pregnancy photo of her is “beautiful and glowing,” does not indicate anything inappropriate, prosecutors argued.
“The photographs in question were professional photos of Minor 1 which Minor 1 shared with many people, in celebration of her joy in being an expectant mother. The reaction AUSA Krull shared reflected nothing more than sincere happiness for a person who had suffered a great deal, but who was now experiencing great personal joy,” Tuesday’s motion states. “The defendants’ efforts to attack the government personally or discourage a testifying victim should not be countenanced.”
There also is nothing inappropriate, the filing stated, about the nickname Krull used for Minor 1 in her phone: “Boss Baby.”
McDavid’s attorneys, indignant, responded that prosecutors did not provide any kind of affidavit or other evidence to support their claims that everything was aboveboard, and urged the judge to make them turn over more information about what happened.
“One can only imagine how the government would respond if a criminal defendant took on a fake name and a surreptitious email account and used it to contact potential witnesses. When he declared he did nothing wrong or that he does not intend to call the witness after the communication is over, does anyone think the government gladly would accept his affirmation?” they wrote.

Krull’s contact with DeRogatis in early 2019 was very limited, prosecutors said. She had a short phone conversation with him about possibly sharing the manuscript of his book, then had a brief email exchange. She did not respond to subsequent emails or voicemails from DeRogatis, the motion states.
Krull did use a burner email account — “piedpiper312@gmail.com” — that was attached to a pseudonym, “Demetrius Slovenski.” But she only did that upon the advice of a Homeland Security Investigations agent, who created the account, the filing stated.
Prosecutors reiterated that they are not considering DeRogatis as a government witness in the case. DeRogatis, whose reporting first brought the allegations against Kelly to light, has previously told the Tribune that he was the one to initiate contact with federal prosecutors, in an attempt to cultivate sources. That effort was unsuccessful, he said.
“Moreover, although defendants vaguely suggest that they may call DeRogatis in the defense case, they offer no explanation of the testimony he might give, or how that testimony would benefit the defense,” prosecutors’ filing states. “Given the nature of DeRogatis’ relationship to the case, it is highly unlikely that he would have any testimony beneficial to the defense.”
McDavid’s attorneys also filed a letter requesting that Krull be made available to testify as a witness in the trial — hinting heavily that if she doesn’t, jurors would be left to assume the worst about the government’s motivations.

Kelly’s Chicago trial comes on the heels of his sentencing in federal court in Brooklyn. In June, he was sentenced to a 30-year prison term for racketeering. He is appealing both the jury’s verdict and the judge’s sentence. He also faces pending cases in Cook County, though those have largely been on hold since the federal indictments came down in 2019.

School supply giveaway in Baton Rouge runs out of materials within an hour,"School supply giveaway in Baton Rouge runs out of materials within an hour
BATON ROUGE - It was an end of summer celebration at the Charles R. Kelly Community Center Sunday afternoon. Despite the heat, hundreds of families were in attendance for free food, music and school supplies.
""It's a huge amount of people and right now its about five after three and from what I understand people have been here since 11,"" said Sherman Jones, a volunteer.
The line of families waiting to receive a bundle of school supplies was wrapped around the building. The event, organized by councilman Daryl Hurst, was originally intended to be able to serve around 500 families.
Within the first hour of the event, the school supplies ran out.
""It also shows the need because they're here,"" Hurst said.
Although the supplies dwindled quickly, other services remained available for the entire duration of the event, such as free haircuts, free books and food served by Baton Rouge firefighters.
""Having kids start off the school year the right way, so beyond the clothes and school supplies, we wanted to make sure they get their haircuts as well because we don't want them going in the way they left out. We want them coming in with a new look, a new 'do, a new you. Look good, feel good, learn good,"" Hurst said.

Allegation of inappropriate witness contact by R. Kelly prosecutor,"By Megan Crepeau and Jason Meisner | Chicago Tribune
CHICAGO — With little more than a week to go until jury selection, R. Kelly’s federal trial in Chicago is shaping up to be a hotblooded, bare-knuckle legal brawl.
A barrage of last-minute filings from attorneys representing Kelly and his two co-defendants has shown little hesitance to bring new fights to the forefront — a far more aggressive approach than the legal team that defended Kelly at his trial last year in New York.
At issue in recent motions: A prosecutor’s purportedly “mysterious, clandestine, and totally inappropriate” communications with possible witnesses. A request for more information about an underage victim that was public, then quickly sealed. A longtime Chicago journalist who has been subpoenaed as a possible witness.
Meanwhile, some 100 prospective jurors are slated to show up at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in about a week.
Kelly, 55, was indicted in July 2019 on charges of conspiring with his former business manager, Derrel McDavid, and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, to rig his 2008 child pornography case in Cook County and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls. The trial is slated to begin Aug. 15 and likely will last at least a month.
Attorneys for McDavid early Friday filed paperwork with new allegations about Assistant U.S. Attorney Angel Krull, one of the lead prosecutors in the case until 2020 when she transferred to another district of the U.S. attorney’s office. Sources told the Tribune she left Chicago to be closer to an ailing relative.
Prosecutors have requested until Tuesday to respond to the allegations.
McDavid’s attorneys allege Krull had inappropriate communications with a central witness in the case: the victim at the center of multiple child-pornography tapes that are expected to be played for jurors at trial. The victim, who is now an adult, is expected to testify that she was the underage girl in the videos and that she lied about it to investigators at the behest of Kelly and his associates.
Krull had the woman’s number saved in her contacts under the name “Boss Baby,” and texted her about meeting outside of work hours. And an investigator sent Krull selfies showing the woman’s pregnancy and Krull later complimented the woman on how she looked, saying that she was “beautiful” and “glowing,” according to McDavid’s attorneys.
The behavior was “extremely familiar and oddly personal in a way that is simply not consistent with the professional standards of the U.S. Attorney’s Office,” the attorneys alleged. There were also meetings and phone calls between the two women that were not memorialized in reports, a lapse in procedure that McDavid alleges could amount to a constitutional violation.
Meanwhile, the Chicago journalist who helped break the news of Kelly’s alleged sexual misconduct more than two decades ago has been subpoenaed as a possible trial witness, according to McDavid’s attorneys. Jim DeRogatis also communicated with Krull in the early stages of the case, though Krull for some reason used an email with the pseudonym “Demetrius Slovenski.”
DeRogatis has previously told the Tribune that he reached out to Krull first, in an unsuccessful attempt to cultivate her as a source. In court earlier this week prosecutors were adamant that DeRogatis is not being considered a potential government witness. McDavid’s attorneys confirmed in a court filing Friday that DeRogatis has been subpoenaed to testify at trial, presumably by McDavid’s attorneys.
DeRogatis, then a music critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, received the sex tape at the center of Kelly’s 2002 case from an unknown sender. He also was called to the stand at R. Kelly’s first trial six years later; he declined to answer questions, citing reporter’s privilege and the First and Fifth amendments.
Meanwhile, attorneys for Kelly on Friday filed paperwork alleging that prosecutors made clerks seal a motion that would paint one of their witnesses in an unflattering light. The defense motion, still under seal, requested more information about potential illegal activity by one of the victims in the case, according to Friday’s filing.
Prosecutors responded by saying they were obligated to keep the filing private since it “refers to a minor victim who is not publicly known and whose identity could be determined” by the information in the motion. They told Kelly’s attorneys that they believed it should be filed under seal, and warned that if it were filed publicly, they would get it back under seal until a judge could sort it out. When Kelly’s attorneys filed it publicly, prosecutors acted “within minutes” to get it off the public docket, according to their response.
Kelly’s Chicago trial comes on the heels of his sentencing in federal court in Brooklyn. In June, he was sentenced to a 30-year prison term for racketeering. He is appealing both the jury’s verdict and the judge’s sentence.
At the hearing Wednesday, Judge Harry Leinenweber revealed that a pool of 100 potential jurors would arrive at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse next week to fill out questionnaires ahead of jury selection — an attempt to weed out ineligible or potentially biased jurors before any in-court questioning. All of the jurors coming in have already indicated that they would be able to sit for a lengthy trial.
Over defense attorneys’ objections, Leinenweber ruled that jurors’ names, occupations and other identifying information would not be revealed to the public. Prosecutors said they worried that Kelly’s die-hard fans would harass jurors if their identities were made known; attorneys for the defense said jurors could get the idea that they should fear for their safety, which could bias them against the defendants.
Leinenweber noted that there is, in fact, “a rather large group of people … quite active in expressing disagreement with (Kelly’s) treatment,” and so the jurors’ identities would remain concealed. But in an effort to address the defense’s concerns, Leinenweber said he will tell jurors they are anonymous simply so that the media does not contact them.
The trial is the biggest to take place since the beginning of the pandemic at Chicago’s federal courthouse, where many COVID-19 restrictions remain in place, including masks for anyone not speaking in court, frequent COVID testing for jurors, witnesses and lawyers, and strict social distancing guidelines.

Evidence of R. Kelly's Alleged Sexual Abuse of Aaliyah Won't Come up in Chicago Trial,"Evidence of R Kelly's marriage with Aaliyah will not be presented in his federal trial this month.
Kelly will be tried on child pornography and sexual abuse charges in Chicago.
Kelly illegally married Aaliyah in 1994 when he she was 15 years old.

Evidence of R Kelly's short-lived sham marriage to R&B singer Aaliyah will not appear in his upcoming Chicago federal trial on child pornography charges, according to court documents.
Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was sentenced in New York federal court to 30 years in prison in June on racketeering and sex-trafficking charges.
He faces a second federal trial in Chicago on August 15 on charges of producing child pornography and the sexual abuse of six minors.
Northern Illinois District Court Judge Harry D. Leinenweber ruled Wednesday on several motions about what evidence was admissible, according to court documents viewed by Insider.
Leinenweber denied a motion by Kelly to exclude evidence of his marriage and alleged sexual relationship with Aaliyah on the grounds that the request was moot after the prosecution responded that it didn't intend to present evidence of the relationship, court documents show.
Kelly also requested that the government not present evidence that he had infected any sexual partner with herpes or that he had impregnated any accuser or facilitated any abortions, the documents state.
The government said it did not plan to present any evidence of either situation.
Against Kelly's request, Judge Leinenweber did rule to allow evidence that he has previously been sued by accusers and evidence of his previous conviction in 2021.
Kelly illegally married Aaliyah in 1994 when he was 27 years old and she was 15 years old so she could get an abortion without permission from her parents, according to testimony at the New York trial.
Multiple witnesses in Kelly's 2021 trial told the jury that Kelly bribed an Illinois government employee to obtain a fake ID for Aaliyah in order to marry her.
Kelly's former employees, Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown, have also been charged in the case and are accused of conspiring to conceal evidence ahead of Kelly's 2008 child-porn trial in Cook County.

With little more than a week to go until jury selection, R. Kelly’s federal trial in Chicago is shaping up to be a hot-blooded, bare-knuckle legal brawl.
A barrage of last-minute filings from attorneys representing Kelly and his two co-defendants have shown little hesitance to bring new fights to the forefront — a far more aggressive approach than the legal team that defended Kelly at his trial last year in New York.

At issue in recent motions: A prosecutor’s purportedly “mysterious, clandestine, and totally inappropriate” communications with possible witnesses. A request for more information about an underage victim that was public, then quickly sealed. A longtime Chicago journalist who has been subpoenaed as a possible witness.
Meanwhile, some 100 prospective jurors are slated to show up at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in about a week.

Kelly, 55, was indicted in July 2019 on charges of conspiring with his former business manager, Derrel McDavid and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, to rig his 2008 child pornography case in Cook County and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls. The trial is slated to begin Aug. 15 and likely will last at least a month.
Attorneys for McDavid early Friday filed paperwork with new allegations about Assistant U.S. Attorney Angel Krull, one of the lead prosecutors in the case until 2020 when she transferred to another district of the U.S. attorney’s office. Sources told the Tribune she left Chicago to be closer to an ailing relative.
Prosecutors have requested until Tuesday to respond to the allegations.
McDavid’s attorneys allege Krull had inappropriate communications with a central witness in the case: the victim at the center of multiple child-pornography tapes that are expected to be played for jurors at trial. The victim, who is now an adult, is expected to testify that she was the underage girl on the videos, and that she lied about it to investigators at the behest of Kelly and his associates.
Krull had the woman’s number saved in her contacts under the name “Boss Baby,” and texted with her about meeting outside of work hours. The woman sent Krull selfies showing her pregnancy, to which Krull responded that she was “beautiful” and “glowing,” according to McDavid’s attorneys.
The behavior was “extremely familiar and oddly personal in a way that is simply not consistent with the professional standards of the U.S. Attorney’s Office,” the attorneys alleged. There were also meetings and phone calls between the two women that were not memorialized in reports, a lapse in procedure that McDavid alleges could amount to a Constitutional violation.
Meanwhile, the Chicago journalist who helped break the news of Kelly’s alleged sexual misconduct more than two decades ago has been subpoenaed as a possible trial witness, according to McDavid’s attorneys. Jim DeRogatis also communicated with Krull in the early stages of the case, though Krull for some reason used an email with the pseudonym “Demetrius Slovenski.”
DeRogatis has previously told the Tribune that he reached out to Krull first, in an unsuccessful attempt to cultivate her as a source. In court earlier this week prosecutors were adamant that DeRogatis is not being considered a potential government witness. McDavid’s attorneys confirmed in a court filing Friday that DeRogatis has been subpoenaed to testify at trial, presumably by McDavid’s attorneys.

DeRogatis, then a music critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, received the sex tape at the center of the Kelly’s 2002 case from an unknown sender. He also was called to the stand at R. Kelly’s first trial six years later; he declined to answer questions, citing reporter’s privilege and the First and Fifth amendments.
Meanwhile, attorneys for Kelly on Friday filed paperwork alleging that prosecutors made clerks seal a motion that would paint one of their witnesses in an unflattering light. The defense motion, still under seal, requested more information about potential illegal activity by one of the victims in the case, according to Friday’s filing.
Prosecutors responded saying they were obligated to keep the filing private since it “refers to a minor victim who is not publicly known and whose identity could be determined” by the information in the motion. They told Kelly’s attorneys that they believed it should be filed under seal, and warned that if it were filed publicly, they would get it back under seal until a judge could sort it out. When Kelly’s attorneys filed it publicly, prosecutors acted “within minutes” to get it off the public docket, according to their response.

Kelly’s Chicago trial comes on the heels of his sentencing in federal court in Brooklyn. In June, he was sentenced to a 30-year prison term for racketeering. He is appealing both the jury’s verdict and the judge’s sentence.
At the hearing Wednesday, Judge Harry Leinenweber revealed that a pool of 100 potential jurors would arrive at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse next week to fill out questionnaires ahead of jury selection — an attempt to weed out ineligible or potentially biased jurors before any in-court questioning. All of the jurors coming in have already indicated that they would be able to sit for a lengthy trial.
Over defense attorneys’ objections, Leinenweber ruled that jurors’ names, occupations and other identifying information would not be revealed to the public. Prosecutors said they worried that Kelly’s die-hard fans would harass jurors if their identities were made known; attorneys for the defense said jurors could get the idea that they should fear for their safety, which could bias them against the defendants.

Leinenweber noted that there is, in fact, “a rather large group of people … quite active in expressing disagreement with (Kelly’s) treatment,” and so the jurors’ identities would remain concealed. But in an effort to address the defense’s concerns, Leinenweber said he will tell jurors they are anonymous simply so that the media does not contact them.
The trial is the biggest to take place since the beginning of the pandemic at Chicago’s federal courthouse, where many COVID-19 restrictions remain in place, including masks for anyone not speaking in court, frequent COVID testing for jurors, witnesses and lawyers, and strict social distancing guidelines.
To accommodate all the parties, the trial is being held in the large ceremonial courtroom on the 25th floor, which has been in high demand. In fact, Leinenweber was adamant on Wednesday that the trial could take no longer than a month, since another trial is slated to start in the ceremonial room in late September.
“We’re going to get it done in four weeks come hell or high water,” Leinenweber said. “I have a reputation of moving a case along.”",2022-08-05T04:00:00Z,https://www.chicagotribune.com,Chicago Tribune

R. Kelly has $27,828 in his prison commissary but hasn't paid a cent toward his court fees and fines, according to federal court documents.
New York Federal federal prosecutors on Thursday asked a judge to order the Bureau of Prisons to seize the money from his inmate trust account and cut a check for that amount to the clerk of courts, according to court documents.
Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, is serving a 30-year prison sentence after being found guilty in September of racketeering and sex-trafficking charges that stemmed from a decadeslong practice of recruiting and grooming girls and young women for illegal sex.
A restitution hearing is scheduled for next month, at which time New York Federal Judge Ann Donnelly will decide how much Kelly will have to pay to the victims of his crimes.
Outside of restitution, Kelly owes over $140,000 in fees and fines. Donnelly issued a $100,000 fine based on the conviction plus a statutory $40,000 human trafficking penalty.
Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, who represents the disgraced R&B star, argued that Kelly is ""pretty close to indigent"" as he didn't have a regular source of income and some stations refuse to play his music.
Prosecutors, though, alleged that Kelly had funneled millions of dollars from music royalties through a childhood friend right before his sex-trafficking conviction.
Kelly is serving his sentence at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where he has befriended the accused subway shooter Frank James and is reportedly singing behind bars.
Kelly is also set to stand trial on additional federal charges of production of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors on August 15 in Chicago. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The trial comes 14 years after he was previously acquitted of 14 child pornography charges in Illinois in 2008.",2022-08-05T04:00:00Z,https://www.insider.com,INSIDER
"Bipartisan group of senators introduce bill to expand Border Patrol, increase pay","A bipartisan group of four senators introduced a bill on Thursday that would create a 2,500-agent Border Patrol reserve force and increase agents’ pay by 14 percent.
The bill, which was introduced by Sens. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), would also standardize professional development and training requirements for all Border Patrol agents.
“Every time I’ve visited with Border Patrol, they have made it clear that they need increased funding to recruit and retain agents,” Portman said in a statement. “At a time when our southern border crisis is heading towards a catastrophe, we must provide Border Patrol with the tools and resources they need to do their jobs.”
The senators said in a press release the reserve force would increase the total number of Border Patrol agents to 20,500.
The bipartisan group also touted the proposed 14-percent pay raise as a way for Border Patrol salaries to be more competitive with other federal law enforcement agencies. Border Patrol agents’ salaries are based on factors like locality and amount of overtime, but agents on average are compensated between $70,234 and $111,407, depending on their grade level, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The agency has reported more than 200,000 monthly encounters at the border with migrants in several months so far this year, surpassing levels reached in past years.
Republicans have laid into Biden over the situation at the border amid the uptick in encounters.
“Biden continues to encourage illegal border crossers to enter the U.S., and our Border Patrol stand between U.S. citizens and people from 150 countries coming into our nation, potentially connected to the Mexican cartels or terrorist organizations worldwide,” Lankford said in a statement.
The bill was also endorsed by the president of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union that represents Border Patrol agents.
The proposal additionally is sponsored by two border-state Democrats, including Kelly, who faces a tough reelection battle in November.
“Our bipartisan bill will give the hardworking men and women of the Border Patrol the support, resources and pay raises they deserve,” he said. “We’ll keep working with Republicans and Democrats to ensure that our law enforcement has the tools needed to recruit and retain agents so we can ensure a secure, fair and orderly process at the border.”",2022-08-04T23:17:36Z,https://thehill.com,The Hill
R. Kelly Jurors at Chicago Child Porn Trial to Remain ‘Confidential’,"A Chicago federal judge ruled Wednesday that R. Kelly’s looming trial on child pornography charges will be decided by a “confidential jury,” citing the risk posed by people who have been “quite active in expressing their disagreement” with the charges against the singer.
At a final hearing ahead of a trial set to start Aug. 15, attorneys for Kelly and his co-defendants argued that the special, secretive treatment might unfairly bias jurors by signaling that their clients posed a risk. But Judge Harry D. Leinenweber sided with government attorneys and said there was good reason to shield jurors identities from the public.
“There is a rather large group of people who feel quite strongly about Mr. Kelly and are quite active in expressing their disagreement with his treatment,” the judge said. “It would seem to me that a confidential jury would help this case.”
The ruling came weeks after prosecutors charged an R. Kelly fan named Christopher Gunn with threatening the government attorneys who handled Kelly’s previous trial in Brooklyn. In asking for confidential status to protect the “integrity” of the Chicago trial, prosecutors cited the attention Kelly’s case has drawn, including members of the public contacting people involved.
“We think that if the jurors names are public during the trial, there is a significant potential that they will be contacted online or in some way, and it will interfere with heir ability to focus and hear the evidence without external influences,” a government lawyer argued Wednesday.
Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, argued back that such claims were merely speculative: “There’s no basis to believe that this case is going to present any problems in terms of harassing the jury or influencing jurors, so it should just proceed like any other case.” And attorneys for Kelly’s co-defendants said that such treatment unfairly signals to jurors that a defendant is dangerous: “When its confidential jury, the jury understands that there is something they need to be worried about.”
Wednesday’s order did not require an “anonymous” jury, in which all information about jurors is shielded. In a confidential jury, the parties involved in the case have access to that info, but it is never released to the public.
After decades of accusations of sexual misconduct, Kelly was convicted last year in New York on racketeering and sex trafficking charges related to accusations that he orchestrated a long-running scheme to recruit and abuse women and underage girls. In June, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
But he’s still facing a second set of charges in Chicago on child pornography and obstruction-of-justice charges. Among other things, prosecutors claim Kelly and others hampered a police investigation into previous state-law child porn charges in Illinois. In addition to Kelly, associates Derrel McDavid and Milton Brown also face charges in the upcoming trial.
At Wednesday’s hearing, Judge Leinenweber dealt with various other pre-trial matters, including a long list of arguments from both sides on what evidence could and couldn’t be admitted in the case. For instance, the judge granted Kelly’s request that the government be barred from mentioning his marriage to Aaliyah; prosecutors didn’t challenge the point.
Near the end of the hearing, Judge Leinenweber asked each side for an estimate of how long the trial might take. All told, the government and the attorneys for the three defendants estimated that it might run six weeks. But the judge, citing limited courtroom space, said the proceedings would need to wrap a bit faster than that.
“We’re going to get it done in four weeks, come hell or high water, and I have a reputation for moving a case along,” Judge Leinenweber said.",2022-08-03T16:39:39Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard
Prosecutor used burner email to talk to author,"With trial just two weeks away, the Chicago federal case against R. Kelly took yet another strange twist Wednesday when it was revealed that the onetime lead prosecutor used a burner email account and a fake name to communicate with the author of a book on Kelly’s sexual misconduct.
But the author, Jim DeRogatis, told the Tribune he was the one who was fishing for information from the prosecutor — Assistant U.S. Attorney Angel Krull — and that he got nowhere.

The emails were revealed in a motion filed early Wednesday by an attorney for Kelly’s co-defendant, Derrel McDavid. The motion alleged Krull had used the pseudonym “Demetrius Slovenski” and username “piedpiper312″ to create a Gmail account on April 16, 2019, three months before Kelly was indicted.
On the day the account was created, Krull began communicating with DeRogatis, a former Chicago Sun-Times reporter and author of the book “Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly,” according to the motion filed by attorneys Beau Brindley and Vadim Glozman.

The emails, which prosecutors turned over in discovery on Monday, indicated that DeRogatis sent Krull a copy of his book, which at that time had not been released to the public, according to the motion. In her response, Krull referenced “an earlier oral conversation with Mr. DeRogatis that occurred that same day,” according to the motion.
Two weeks later, DeRogatis sent an email to Krull’s burner account asking “if the book was any help,” the motion stated. He also provided information about a conversation he’d had about the ongoing criminal investigation “with a prominent ‘enabler’ mentioned (in his book).”
Krull left the case in 2020 when she transferred to another district of the U.S. attorney’s office. Sources told the Tribune she left Chicago to be closer to an ailing relative.
“Due to the extraordinary nature of these communications, Mr. McDavid asks the court to compel additional discovery about the circumstances of the conversation, how it came to light and its disclosure,” the defense motion stated.
At a pretrial conference on Wednesday morning, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeannice Appenteng said the materials were turned over “out of an abundance of caution” but have no bearing on the criminal trial, which is set to begin on Aug. 15. Appenteng said DeRogatis is not a witness and that the government has “never interviewed him.”
Brindley, however, wasn’t buying it. “We’re troubled by this,” he said. “We want to get more information. It is very, very strange.”
DeRogatis told the Tribune on Wednesday that he was the one to reach out to federal prosecutors in 2019, in an attempt to develop sources in the office. Ultimately, that effort was unsuccessful, he said.
“Angel never gave me a damn thing,” he said. “No federal prosecutor ever did.”

When DeRogatis reached Krull by phone in spring 2019, introducing himself as a journalist who had been reporting on Kelly for decades, she said she could not speak to him, according to DeRogatis.
“I said, ‘It’s a really complicated story, it goes on 20 years, my book is coming out,’” DeRogatis told the Tribune. Krull said she would be interested in seeing the book and gave him the “piedpiper” email address, according to DeRogatis.
“The amount of skulduggery I had to deal with from sources, attorneys and other people for 20-plus years, was I surprised I (got) a weird email? No,” DeRogatis said. “So I sent her the book and I said, ‘Here’s the book, I’d love to chat.’ And a couple weeks later I said, ‘Was the book helpful? I’d love to chat.’ And I never heard back. Nothing.”
DeRogatis emphasized that federal prosecutors have not contacted him about being a possible witness in the upcoming trial, and he did not provide anyone with information that had not already been reported.
U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber told prosecutors to file a written response to Brindley’s motion by the end of the week.
Kelly, 55, was indicted in July 2019 on charges of conspiring with McDavid and another associate, Milton “June” Brown, to rig his 2008 child pornography case in Cook County and hide years of alleged sexual abuse of underage girls.

Security is also being beefed up in and around the courthouse to accommodate the throng of media and Kelly supporters expected to attend the trial. Phones will likely not be permitted at all in the courtroom, and court security officers are expected to tightly control the use of electronic devices in an overflow room.
Kelly’s fans and detractors have for years created an echo chamber of bickering on social media, and as Wednesday’s telephone hearing drew to a close, some of them began to chime in.
“Love you, Robert Kelly!” said one.
“Free Kellz! Free Kellz!” added another.

"R. Kelly Fan Should Be Jailed for Intimidation, Feds Say","Prosecutors are asking a federal judge to revoke bond for an R. Kelly fan charged with threatening the government attorneys who tried the disgraced singer last year, claiming he’s repeatedly tried to identity and intimidate witnesses on YouTube.
In a letter Wednesday, prosecutors said that Christopher Gunn had “repeatedly posted content on his social media accounts” that mentions a potential witness and encourages his supports to file criminal complaints against the person.
“For example, on or about July 7, 2022, the defendant publicly shared a video titled ‘Informant 1 Threatening My Life’ on the ‘Deboski Gunn’ YouTube account,” prosecutors told the judge. “It is believed that the defendant’s use of ‘Informant 1’ is a reference to the person referred to as ‘Individual-1’ in the complaint.”
Gunn was arrested in June on a charge of making threats involving serious bodily injury or death against three federal prosecutors who worked on Kelly’s case. The charges came two days before the disgraced singer sentenced to 30 years in prison for racketeering and sex trafficking. Gunn has pleaded not guilty; if convicted, he faces up to 5 years in prison.
Prosecutors say Gunn posted a YouTube video in which he identified the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn and then said we’re “going to storm they office.” The video also allegedly identified the three prosecutors by name.
“[I]f you ain’t got the stomach for the sh-t we bout to do, I’m asking that you just bail out,” Gunn allegedly said on the video, before playing a clip from the film Boyz N The Hood in which guns are loaded and a gunshot can be heard.
On July 1, Gunn was released from jail on a $10,000 bond and placed under house arrest, but with the strict condition that he “avoid all contact, directly or indirectly, with any person who is or may be a victim or witness in the investigation or prosecution.” The release order specifically mentioned that those restrictions included any contact via social media.
But according to Wednesday’s letter, Gunn has repeatedly violated those terms. The last straw appears to be a post on Monday, in which prosecutors say he reshared a post from another YouTube user that said the unnamed witness should be “should be very scared” and that the person’s best option was to “remain silent.”
The letter also mentioned that officials monitoring Gunn’s release had reported several other violations.
“Less than 30 days following the defendant’s release to home incarceration, the defendant has amassed numerous violations of his release conditions, including by the apparent use of marijuana, non-compliance with home incarceration, and attempting to identity and intimidate witnesses,” prosecutors wrote.
If granted, the revocation of bond will mean that Gunn will be forced to await trial in jail. His attorney did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday’s letter.",2022-07-28T17:04:43Z,https://www.billboard.com,Billboard

,""African Americans have always been treated unfairly. And so I think that has a lot to do with [R. Kelly's sentence] as well as other factors,"" said Cassandra. The host, Noel Phillips, pressed her about whether she believes her brother has had sexual relations with underage women. Cassandra called the victims ""bitter,"" before seemingly denying that he has ever engaged in sexual acts with minors.
""I can say he may have been with younger women, but as far as underage girls, no—and I stress underage girls. Who has seen that? I believe a lot of the alleged victims are bitter,"" she added.
Phillips pushed back against this claim, asking if they would ""acknowledge the victims."" However, she stated that she wouldn't ""acknowledge something I don't have proof of.""
""He is not a monster, he is not a pedophile,"" Lisa Kelly said. ""The only victim I've seen that's been stolen from, lied on, is Robert.""
She added, ""I don't care about what a lot of people [say], I can only go by what I see, what I know, what I've experienced.""

Manager bekent stalken van slachtoffer R. Kelly,"Donnell Russell, de manager van R. Kelly, is dinsdag schuldig bevonden aan het stalken van een van de slachtoffers van de Amerikaanse rapper. De man gaf toe een van R. Kelly's slachtoffers te hebben bedreigd en lastiggevallen zodat zij haar mond zou houden over het seksueel misbruik dat heeft plaatsgevonden, zo meldt Associated Press.
Russell moest dinsdag voor de rechter in Brooklyn, New York verschijnen. Daar werden de bedreigende berichten van Russell aan het slachtoffer besproken en de expliciete foto's die hij van haar online had gedeeld. De bedreigingen duurden van november 2018 tot februari 2020, waarop het slachtoffer aangifte deed.
De manager van R. Kelly moet volgens de planning vanaf 17 november de gevangenis in. Er staat hem een maximale gevangenisstraf van vijf jaar te wachten. Eerder deze maand werd Russell ook schuldig bevonden, omdat hij een bioscoop had gebeld met de boodschap dat er een schietpartij zou gaan plaatsvinden. Dat gebeurde vlak voordat de film Surviving R. Kelly werd gedraaid, een film waarin het verhaal van de zanger wordt verteld.

R. Kelly's Sisters Say Racism Influenced 30-Year Sentence for Sex Abuse,"R. Kelly's sisters have said that racism played a role in their brother being sentenced to 30 years in prison, after he was found guilty of sexually abusing women, girls and boys for decades.
Kelly, 55, was on June 29 handed the lengthy prison sentence in New York City, several months after he was convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking and racketeering.
Musician Kelly sexually abused fans in a ""systematic scheme that went on for decades,"" according to the Associated Press.
However, in interview with U.K. TV show Good Morning Britain, which aired on Wednesday, Kelly's three sisters spoke out in the convicted sex offender's defense, insisting that he's the true victim.
GMB North America correspondent Noel Phillips prefaced the interview by stating that Kelly had been sending letters from his prison cell, saying that his 30-year sentence was because of the color of his skin.
Reiterating this point, Cassandra Kelly said: ""African Americans have always been treated unfairly. And so I think that has a lot to do with [R. Kelly's sentence], as well as other factors.""
When asked whether the sisters truly believe that their brother had not been with underage girls, Lisa Kelly responded: ""I can say he may have been with younger women, but as far as underage girls, no—and I stress underage girls. Who has seen that? I believe a lot of the alleged victims are bitter.""
Phillips then followed up by asking if Lisa Kelly could ""acknowledge the victims,"" prompting her to respond: ""I'm not going to acknowledge something I don't have proof of.""
""He is not a monster, he is not a pedophile,"" Lisa Kelly said of her brother, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly. ""The only victim I've seen that's been stolen from, lied on, is Robert.""
""How can you sit here and say R. Kelly was the victim?"" Phillips asked.
""I just told you,"" Lisa Kelly said in response. ""I don't care about what a lot of people [say], I can only go by what I see, what I know, what I've experienced.""

Asked whether R. Kelly has reacted emotionally or expressed regret in the aftermath, Cassandra Kelly replied: ""He'll be like, forgive them.""
However, R. Kelly's victims have said they don't want his forgiveness, telling Phillips it should be the other way around.
In a statement read out by Phillips during the GMB broadcast on Wednesday, one of the victims said: ""R. Kelly's sisters should be supporting us women of color for bravely speaking out. He deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail.""
Kitti Jones, one of R. Kelly's victims who testified in his recent case, said that he should never be released from prison.
""A lot of people have been waiting for this, not just the survivors, but families of survivors.""
R. Kelly's legal team has expressed their intent to appeal his recent sentencing. He was also put on suicide watch following the sentencing which his legal team argued was ""unnecessary, punitive and cruel.""
On July 13, Kelly was moved from New York to Chicago where he will face four counts of the production of child pornography, five counts of child sex trafficking, three counts of receipt of child pornography and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.",2022-07-27T09:50:53Z,https://www.newsweek.com,Newsweek

R. Kelly’s sisters have claimed racism played a part in the disgraced 90s singer’s sentencing to 30 years in prison after he was found guilty of sexually abusing women, boys and girls for decades.
The 55-year-old was convicted by a federal jury in New York in September last year and sentenced in June.
Judge Ann Donnelly said he had used his “minions” to “lure young fans into your orbit”, and there were parts of his victims' testimony she would ""never forget"".
He was branded a ""predator"" who used his fame and fortune to ""prey on the young, the vulnerable, and the voiceless for his own sexual gratification"" following his conviction.
Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was convicted on multiple counts of racketeering, with the charges relating to bribery and forced labour. He was also found in violation of an anti-sex trafficking law known as the Mann Act.

The Ignition hitmaker, who denied all charges, was found guilty on all nine counts against him following a six-week trial in Brooklyn, New York.
The disgraced singer’s sisters have now claimed he was treated “unfairly”, during a sit-down interview with Good Morning Britain reporter Noel Phillips in New York.
Noel claimed that one of R. Kelly’s accusers had told him it is “laughable” to see him be portrayed as a “victim” by his sisters.
He said to the three women: “We can reveal this morning that the convicted sex offender has been writing letters from inside his prison cell claiming that he was given a 30 year sentence, because of the colour of his skin.”

“Having sat through most of his trial in New York, that certainly was not the case. The evidence against him was seriously damning.
“A prosecutor who was involved in that case has told me that, ‘It’s never been about race and that the US justice system has done it’s job in locking up a sexual predator.”
Cassandra Kelly replied: “African Americans have always been treated unfairly and so I think that has a lot to do with it [his sentence] as well as other factors.”
When asked whether they could say R. Kelly has never been involved with underage girls, Lisa Kelly answered: “I can say he may have been with younger women, but as far as under aged girls, no and I stress girls – underage girls. Who has seen that?”
Lisa then refused to acknowledge the victims of her brother’s abuse, saying: “I’m not going to acknowledge something that I don’t have the proof of. I believe that a lot of the alleged victims are bitter.”

Lisa continued: “He is not a monster. He is not a paedophile. The only victim I’ve seen who has been stolen from, lied on is Robert.”
Noel said: “How can you sit here and say R Kelly is a victim? A lot of people will be confused.”
Lisa replied: “I just told you. I don’t care about people. I can only go by what I have seen, what I know, what I have experienced.”
The court last month heard victim impact statements from seven women, presented anonymously to the court as Jane Does, who detailed Kelly’s “God-like complex” and how he used his “fame and power” to entice his victims.
A woman using the pseudonym Angela told him: “The pied piper of R&B, both in music and in technique and in approach.

“Success and love… you presented these glittering gems as if they were gold.
“With every addition of a new victim you grew in wickedness, cockiness, diminishing any form of humanity or self-awareness, which soon became the breeding ground for your God-like complex.
“You were doing, saying and encouraging despicable things that no one should be doing.""
“We reclaim our names from beneath the shadows of your afflicted trauma.”

July 26 (UPI) -- A Chicago man who said he was a manager, advisor and friend of R. Kelly has pleaded guilty to having threatened, harassed and blackmailed one of the disgraced R&B singer's victims. Donnell Russell, 47, pleaded guilty Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Ann M. Donnelly to one count of interstate stalking for harassing and intimidating a woman identified in court documents as Jane Doe in order to force her to drop her allegations against the singer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly.

""Russell used threats, harassment and intimidation in a deliberate effort to silence one of R. Kelly's victims and prevent her voice from being heard,"" U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said in a statement.
""When the initial effort failed, he continued his vile campaign by sending threatening messages to Jane Doe and her mother, and publishing explicit photos of the victim on the Internet before and after Kelly was indicted.""

Kelly was sentenced in late June to 30 years in prison on one racketeering charge that included 12 underlying acts of sexual exploitation of a child, kidnapping, bribery and sex trafficking as well as eight counts of violating the Mann Act sex trafficking law. Doe was a witness in the trial and has also filed a civil lawsuit against the ""I believe I can fly"" singer.
On Tuesday, Russell admitted to harassing and intimidating Doe and her mother from November 2018 when they filed their lawsuit against Kelly to February 2020.
Russell had threatened the pair via phone, mail and Internet that he would reveal sexually explicit photographs of Doe as well as her sexual history if she did not withdraw her lawsuit and stop participating in the racketeering case.
Among the threats included a letter he sent to Doe's lawyer on Oct. 22, 2018, that warned if she ""really cares about her own reputation she should cease her participation and association with the organizers of this negative campaign,"" according to the original criminal complaint.
The letter contained sexually explicit photographs and text messages from Doe.
On Dec. 21 of that same year, Russell under the alias of Colon Dunn sent Doe and her mother a series of threatening text messages that included the explicit images.

Then on Jan. 3, 2019, Doe and her mother received a text message from Russell warning ""pull the plug or you will be exposed."" Days later, Russell created a Facebook page and posted screen shots of text messages between Doe and Kelly that contained some of the explicit photographs. He also displayed them during interviews with vloggers that were live streamed on YouTube.
""Through the use of intimidation tactics, Russell repeatedly and purposefully worked to silence 'Jane Doe' from revealing the emotional and physical trauma inflicted on her by R. Kelly and his associates,"" Homeland Security Investigations Acting Special Agent-in-Charge Ricky Patel said.
""Despite multiple threats, Russell ultimately failed in his efforts and will now face the consequences of his despicable behavior.""
Russell was charged along with Michael Williams and Richard Arline Jr. in August of 2020 with attempting to influence the testimony of R. Kelly's victims.
Williams was sentenced in November of last year to 96 months in prison for setting fire to a vehicle at the home of a victim in the R. Kelly racketeering case.
In February, Arline pleaded guilty to offering hush money to a woman who said she entered into a sexual relationship with Kelly as a minor.

A self-described manager and adviser to R. Kelly pleaded guilty Tuesday to an interstate stalking charge, less than a week after he was convicted of making a phone threat that gunfire was about to occur in a Manhattan theater where a documentary about the singer was about to be shown.
Donnell Russell, 47, of Chicago, entered the plea in Brooklyn federal court.

Prosecutors said the harassment campaign stretched from November 2018 to February 2020 after the woman filed a civil lawsuit against Kelly.
Last Friday, a Manhattan federal court jury found Russell guilty of threatening physical harm through interstate communication.
The jury concluded that Russell made a phone threat that forced the evacuation of a theater where Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly” series was to be shown, and a panel discussion was to occur featuring several women in the documentary.
Prosecutors argued during the one-week trial that Russell was trying to protect the lucrative career of Kelly, a Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling songwriter.
A trial witness had testified that a man with a deep voice had called the theater to warn that “someone had a gun and they were going to shoot up the place.” Prosecutors said the call was placed to the theater from Russell’s home on a day when Russell made nine phone calls to the theater to try to stop the airing of the documentary.",2022-07-27T04:00:00Z,https://www.chicagotribune.com,Chicago Tribune
Man who described himself as R. Kelly's manager pleads guilty to stalking victim,"A Chicago man who described himself as a manager and adviser to R. Kelly pleaded guilty Tuesday to stalking one of the victims of the imprisoned singer, federal prosecutors in New York City said.
Donnell Russell pleaded guilty to one count of interstate stalking, the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn said in a statement.
Kelly, known for hits like “I Believe I Can Fly,” is serving a 30-year prison sentence after he was found guilty on all counts in a sex-trafficking trial last year.
Starting in 2018, Russell tried to intimidate one of the victims in that criminal case, who had also sued Kelly, prosecutors said.
Russell threatened to expose sexually explicit photos of the victim if she didn’t drop the lawsuit, and he later did show the photos on a Facebook page and in livestreamed video interviews, the U.S. attorney’s office said.
The stalking charge carries a maximum of five years in prison, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.
The U.S. attorney’s office statement said Russell is a self-described manager, adviser and friend to the singer. An attorney for Kelly denied that Russell ever had such a role.
“Don Russell was never Mr. Kelly’s manager or advisor, and he is certainly is no friend to Mr. Kelly,” Kelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said in an email Tuesday night.
Attorneys listed as representing Russell didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.
On Friday, a jury convicted Russell in a separate federal case that alleged he phoned in a threat to a Manhattan movie theater that planned to screen the “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary series in late 2018, court records show.
The caller said someone had a gun and was going to shoot up the theater, and it was evacuated. The documentary series premiered on Lifetime in January 2019.
Kelly, 55, had long been trailed by accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse. He was indicted in 2019 and sentenced in June. His trial centered on the allegations of six people.
Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has denied the allegations. He was convicted of racketeering and violating the Mann Act, a law that bans transporting people across state lines for prostitution or criminal sexual activity.",2022-07-27T02:32:55Z,https://www.nbcnews.com,NBC News
R. Kelly’s ex-manager Donnell Russell pleads guilty to stalking victim,"An advisor close to convicted sex trafficker R. Kelly pleaded guilty to harassing and intimidating one of the ex-R&B singer’s victims, federal prosecutors announced Tuesday.
Chicago native Donnell Russell, the self-described manager for Kelly, pleaded guilty to interstate stalking in Brooklyn federal court after he was accused of threatening to reveal sexually explicit photos of the victim, according to the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York.
Russell warned the victim he would publicly reveal her sexual history if she did not withdraw a civil lawsuit she filed against Kelly, prosecutors said. He demanded she “cease her participation and association with organizers” of a “negative campaign” against the “I Believe I Can Fly” singer.
Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was convicted in September 2021 for sexually abusing women and underage girls and boys over the course of decades.
Russell’s guilty plea is only the latest legal trouble for the Kelly loyalist.
On Friday, he was found guilty of threatening harm by interstate communication after he called in an active-shooter threat to a private Manhattan club showing a screening of the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly” in 2018.

US Attorney Breon Peace slammed Russell in a statement Monday for using “threats, harassment and intimidation in a deliberate effort to silence one of R. Kelly’s victims and prevent her voice from being heard.”
“When his initial effort failed, he continued his vile campaign by sending threatening messages to Jane Doe and her mother, and publishing explicit photos of the victim on the internet before and after Kelly was indicted.
“As this prosecution makes clear, the defendant’s conduct was not only reprehensible, but it was also criminal and will not be tolerated.”

In November 2018, Russell helped send a letter with attachments purportedly written by Kelly to the victim’s Brooklyn lawyer that included cropped nude photos of the victim, the feds said. The text in the letter stated, “the next two pictures have been cropped for the sake of not exposing her extremities to the world, yet!!!”
The following month, Russell, using the alias, Colon Dunn, sent a blitz of texts to the victim and her mother with the same nude photos, stating “Just a sample. We will seek criminal charges. You’ve been warned,” and “Publishing soon.”
He also texted “[T]his is Colon.”
At the start of 2019, he again texted the victim and her mother, “Pull the plug or you will be exposed.”
His guilty plea came days after being convicted of calling in a bogus active shooter threat to a “Surviving R. Kelly” screening. AP
Also in January 2019, he began a Facebook page intended to defend Kelly and posted text exchanges between Kelly and the victim with the same sexually explicit pics, prosecutors said. The Facebook page was “Surviving Lies,” which was a play on the “Surviving R. Kelly” series.
And then in January 2020, he again showed the sexually explicit photos during live interviews with vloggers over YouTube who supported Kelly amid his mounting legal troubles.
He could face five years in prison.",2022-07-26T23:49:16Z,https://nypost.com,New York Post

After R&B star R.
